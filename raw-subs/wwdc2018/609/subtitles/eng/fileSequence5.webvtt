00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.296 A:middle
produce an output.

00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:02.396 A:middle
It's very similar to inference.

00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:05.416 A:middle
And next, we need to compute

00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:05.766 A:middle
loss.

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.156 A:middle
So, loss intuitively measures

00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:09.326 A:middle
the difference between the

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:10.906 A:middle
network's output and the ground

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:11.196 A:middle
truth.

00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:14.726 A:middle
The objective of a training

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:16.216 A:middle
algorithm is to minimize loss.

00:05:17.076 --> 00:05:20.596 A:middle
Our next step is the gradient

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:21.426 A:middle
pass.

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:22.926 A:middle
This is when we propagate this

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:24.136 A:middle
difference when the network's

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:26.166 A:middle
output and the ground truth,

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.506 A:middle
back to the network to update

00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:28.756 A:middle
weights.

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:32.486 A:middle
The idea is that as training

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:34.036 A:middle
continues, our network is

00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:35.656 A:middle
becoming better trained, so it's

00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:37.886 A:middle
better able to map inputs to

00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:40.486 A:middle
correct outputs, which in turn

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:41.426 A:middle
helps to minimize loss.

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:45.136 A:middle
So, this is an overview and now

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.466 A:middle
let's take a look at each one of

00:05:46.466 --> 00:05:47.686 A:middle
these steps in more detail.

00:05:47.986 --> 00:05:50.986 A:middle
The forward pass involves

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:53.226 A:middle
propagation forward to the

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.046 A:middle
network, to compute an output.

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:57.416 A:middle
As you can see, during this

00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:59.246 A:middle
first situation of training, our

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
network is not doing so well.
