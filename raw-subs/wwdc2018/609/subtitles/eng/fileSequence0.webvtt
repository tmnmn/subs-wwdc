&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:33.356 A:middle
Welcome to our talk on Metal for

00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:34.666 A:middle
Accelerating Machine Learning.

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:37.366 A:middle
My name is Anna Tikhonova, and

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.606 A:middle
I'm an Engineer on the GPU

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.006 A:middle
Software Team.

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
The Metal Performance Shaders

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.596 A:middle
Framework is built on top of

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:45.926 A:middle
Metal.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:48.216 A:middle
And it provides GPU accelerated

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.886 A:middle
primitives that are optimized

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:51.646 A:middle
for both iOS and macOS.

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:54.516 A:middle
We provide primitives for image

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:56.846 A:middle
processing, linear algebra, and

00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:57.566 A:middle
machine learning.

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:00.106 A:middle
We talked extensively about
