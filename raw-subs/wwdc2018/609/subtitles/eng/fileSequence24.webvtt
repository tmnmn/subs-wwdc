00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:00.586 A:middle
context of your training loop?

00:24:02.716 --> 00:24:04.546 A:middle
So, here we again have our

00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:05.526 A:middle
training loop, where we're

00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:06.836 A:middle
training a neural network for a

00:24:06.836 --> 00:24:07.696 A:middle
number of EPOCHS.

00:24:09.276 --> 00:24:10.826 A:middle
To check whether you can stop

00:24:10.826 --> 00:24:11.926 A:middle
training, you need to have a

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:13.076 A:middle
test set of images.

00:24:13.426 --> 00:24:14.726 A:middle
So, a test set of images

00:24:15.046 --> 00:24:17.056 A:middle
contains images that are not

00:24:17.056 --> 00:24:17.866 A:middle
used for training.

00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
They're only used to evaluate

00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:21.546 A:middle
the accuracy of your network.

00:24:22.486 --> 00:24:24.336 A:middle
So, after each EPOCH, you can

00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:26.426 A:middle
optionally wait for the graph to

00:24:27.096 --> 00:24:28.686 A:middle
-- for the GPU to stop running

00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:31.056 A:middle
the graph, and then you can use

00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:33.066 A:middle
the current trained parameters

00:24:33.846 --> 00:24:35.236 A:middle
to initialize an inference

00:24:35.236 --> 00:24:35.646 A:middle
network.

00:24:36.916 --> 00:24:38.216 A:middle
And then you can run this

00:24:38.216 --> 00:24:39.636 A:middle
inference network on your test

00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:41.476 A:middle
set, and you can optionally stop

00:24:41.476 --> 00:24:43.356 A:middle
training when the accuracy of

00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:44.906 A:middle
your network on this test set,

00:24:45.216 --> 00:24:46.426 A:middle
reaches a particular level.

00:24:49.116 --> 00:24:51.486 A:middle
So, now that we've discussed all

00:24:51.486 --> 00:24:53.816 A:middle
of the steps that are necessary

00:24:53.816 --> 00:24:54.996 A:middle
to train a neural network in

00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:57.026 A:middle
MPS, it's time for a demo.

00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
So, as was already mentioned in
