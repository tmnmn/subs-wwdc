00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:00.556 A:middle
This new feature is available on

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.936 A:middle
devices with an Apple A11 Bionic

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:03.216 A:middle
GPU.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:06.516 A:middle
We find that using FP16

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:07.856 A:middle
accumulation for inference

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:09.266 A:middle
workloads is more than

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:10.956 A:middle
sufficient in terms of precision

00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:13.636 A:middle
for many commonly used neural

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:14.036 A:middle
networks.

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:17.866 A:middle
FP16 accumulation offers better

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.926 A:middle
precision and significant power

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:20.556 A:middle
benefits.

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.196 A:middle
So, please take advantage of it

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:23.926 A:middle
in your inference workloads.

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:26.996 A:middle
And this is an example of how

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:29.046 A:middle
you can enable FP16 accumulation

00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:30.536 A:middle
for a convolution primitive.

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:31.806 A:middle
You just need to set the

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:33.446 A:middle
accumulatorPrecisionOption

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:33.906 A:middle
property.

00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:38.536 A:middle
And now, let's talk in depth

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.296 A:middle
about the main topic of this

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:41.986 A:middle
session, training neural

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:42.536 A:middle
networks.

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:44.356 A:middle
And let's start with training

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:46.476 A:middle
convolutional neural networks.

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:50.296 A:middle
So, here we have a simple,

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.856 A:middle
handwritten, digit recognition

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.606 A:middle
network that takes an image of a

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:57.336 A:middle
handwritten image as input, and

00:03:57.646 --> 00:03:59.256 A:middle
assigns it to one of 10 classes,

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
from 0 to 9.
