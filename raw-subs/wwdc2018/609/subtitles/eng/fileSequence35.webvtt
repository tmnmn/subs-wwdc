00:34:59.616 --> 00:35:00.966 A:middle
it easy to convert between

00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:02.006 A:middle
images and matrices.

00:35:02.836 --> 00:35:06.166 A:middle
So, in order to copy an image to

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.406 A:middle
a matrix, you need to use the

00:35:07.406 --> 00:35:09.546 A:middle
MPI's Image Copy to Matrix

00:35:09.746 --> 00:35:10.056 A:middle
Kernel.

00:35:10.256 --> 00:35:11.456 A:middle
So, this is how you can create

00:35:11.456 --> 00:35:13.206 A:middle
one, and this is how you can

00:35:13.206 --> 00:35:15.746 A:middle
encode one on a batch of images.

00:35:17.186 --> 00:35:19.506 A:middle
Here, each row in a destination

00:35:19.506 --> 00:35:21.586 A:middle
matrix, will contain one source

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:21.926 A:middle
image.

00:35:23.026 --> 00:35:25.036 A:middle
And to copy from a matrix to an

00:35:25.036 --> 00:35:27.066 A:middle
image, you need to use the MPS

00:35:27.486 --> 00:35:29.216 A:middle
Matrix Copy to Image Kernel.

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:30.676 A:middle
This is how you can create one

00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:32.476 A:middle
and this is how you encode one

00:35:32.476 --> 00:35:33.166 A:middle
to the GPU.

00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:37.586 A:middle
So, we just showed you how to

00:35:37.586 --> 00:35:40.376 A:middle
train CNNs and RNNs using MPS.

00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:43.656 A:middle
We also showed you a demo of

00:35:43.716 --> 00:35:45.226 A:middle
Turi Create which is now powered

00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:45.646 A:middle
by MPS.

00:35:45.646 --> 00:35:47.526 A:middle
And now it's time for one more

00:35:47.526 --> 00:35:47.806 A:middle
demo.

00:35:49.576 --> 00:35:51.276 A:middle
We have been working with Google

00:35:51.276 --> 00:35:52.376 A:middle
to add support to the Metal

00:35:52.376 --> 00:35:54.236 A:middle
Performance Shaders Framework to

00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:58.086 A:middle
TensorFlow to accelerate machine

00:35:58.086 --> 00:35:59.716 A:middle
learning on macOS, and we would

00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:00.966 A:middle
love to show you a demo of that
