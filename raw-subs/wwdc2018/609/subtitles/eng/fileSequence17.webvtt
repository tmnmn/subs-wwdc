00:16:58.856 --> 00:17:00.326 A:middle
how the label's data is laid out

00:17:00.326 --> 00:17:00.836 A:middle
in memory.

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:03.886 A:middle
And then you need to create an

00:17:03.886 --> 00:17:05.665 A:middle
MPSCNNLossLabel object, with

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:06.415 A:middle
this descriptor.

00:17:06.976 --> 00:17:09.445 A:middle
And then you create a batch of

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.586 A:middle
these for training, and when the

00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:13.066 A:middle
GPU's done running the graph,

00:17:13.506 --> 00:17:15.236 A:middle
your batch of labels will

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:16.675 A:middle
contain the per image loss

00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:18.626 A:middle
values for the batch.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.006 A:middle
And you can inspect these

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:21.496 A:middle
values, or you can compute a

00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:22.955 A:middle
single value across the batch

00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:23.976 A:middle
and inspect that value.

00:17:27.356 --> 00:17:28.946 A:middle
So, now that we have a training

00:17:28.946 --> 00:17:30.626 A:middle
graph and we talked about how to

00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:32.706 A:middle
provide inputs to our graph,

00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:34.186 A:middle
let's talk about how to provide

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.726 A:middle
weights to the graph nodes that

00:17:35.726 --> 00:17:36.316 A:middle
require weights.

00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:40.606 A:middle
The only way to provide weights

00:17:40.606 --> 00:17:42.546 A:middle
to convolution fully connected,

00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:45.456 A:middle
batch normalization and instance

00:17:45.456 --> 00:17:47.356 A:middle
normalization nodes, is through

00:17:47.356 --> 00:17:48.966 A:middle
data source provider protocols.

00:17:50.146 --> 00:17:52.216 A:middle
This is an example of how to

00:17:52.216 --> 00:17:54.116 A:middle
create a convolution node, with

00:17:54.116 --> 00:17:55.166 A:middle
a data source provider.

00:17:56.206 --> 00:17:58.636 A:middle
You need to implement a class

00:17:58.636 --> 00:18:00.106 A:middle
that conforms to the protocol.
