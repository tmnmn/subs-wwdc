10 iterations of training, it

00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:02.366 A:middle
would take more than 10

00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:03.496 A:middle
iterations to train this

00:27:03.496 --> 00:27:04.606 A:middle
network, and we're not going to

00:27:04.606 --> 00:27:05.576 A:middle
do this on stage.

00:27:06.116 --> 00:27:07.366 A:middle
But what I'm going to do right

00:27:07.366 --> 00:27:09.546 A:middle
now, is to load a network that

00:27:09.546 --> 00:27:11.796 A:middle
we pretrained in advance, run it

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.246 A:middle
on a test set of images and

00:27:13.246 --> 00:27:14.696 A:middle
visualize some of the results.

00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:15.586 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:27:16.216 --> 00:27:20.306 A:middle
Okay, so here we have a banana,

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:21.776 A:middle
that's correctly classified as a

00:27:21.776 --> 00:27:22.286 A:middle
banana.

00:27:22.656 --> 00:27:24.706 A:middle
And we have a bounding box, and

00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:26.866 A:middle
now we have a perfect breakfast

00:27:26.866 --> 00:27:27.976 A:middle
of a cup of coffee and a

00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:30.796 A:middle
croissant, and very,

00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:31.496 A:middle
mean-looking egg.

00:27:32.136 --> 00:27:35.776 A:middle
Okay, so that's it for the Turi

00:27:35.776 --> 00:27:36.396 A:middle
Create demo.

00:27:38.516 --> 00:27:43.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:43.546 --> 00:27:47.016 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:27:47.556 --> 00:27:49.036 A:middle
And now, let's switch gears and

00:27:49.036 --> 00:27:50.526 A:middle
talk about training recurrent

00:27:50.526 --> 00:27:51.266 A:middle
neural networks.

00:27:51.996 --> 00:27:53.876 A:middle
But first, let's do a recap of

00:27:53.876 --> 00:27:54.986 A:middle
what are the recurrent neural

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:55.396 A:middle
networks?

00:27:57.296 --> 00:27:58.716 A:middle
One of the disadvantages of

00:27:58.716 --> 00:28:00.516 A:middle
convolutional neural networks is
