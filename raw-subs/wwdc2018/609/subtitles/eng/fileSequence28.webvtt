00:27:58.716 --> 00:28:00.516 A:middle
convolutional neural networks is

00:28:00.516 --> 00:28:02.906 A:middle
their inability to remember

00:28:02.906 --> 00:28:03.816 A:middle
anything that happened

00:28:03.816 --> 00:28:04.366 A:middle
previously.

00:28:05.336 --> 00:28:07.076 A:middle
They can take one input, such as

00:28:07.076 --> 00:28:09.776 A:middle
an image, and generate a single

00:28:09.776 --> 00:28:11.306 A:middle
output, such as a set of

00:28:11.366 --> 00:28:12.466 A:middle
probabilities of what is

00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:13.136 A:middle
depicted in the image.

00:28:13.136 --> 00:28:19.296 A:middle
RNNs on the other hand, have

00:28:19.296 --> 00:28:19.756 A:middle
memory.

00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:21.636 A:middle
And they're good at operating on

00:28:21.636 --> 00:28:23.676 A:middle
sequences of inputs and outputs.

00:28:24.676 --> 00:28:26.146 A:middle
For example, they can take one

00:28:26.146 --> 00:28:27.546 A:middle
set of probabilities, so what is

00:28:27.546 --> 00:28:29.556 A:middle
depicted in an image, which is

00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:32.026 A:middle
an output of a CNN, and generate

00:28:32.026 --> 00:28:33.886 A:middle
a sequence of outputs, which is

00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:35.436 A:middle
a sequence of words that make up

00:28:35.436 --> 00:28:36.656 A:middle
a caption for this image.

00:28:37.196 --> 00:28:40.136 A:middle
They can also take a sequence of

00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:42.336 A:middle
inputs, such as a sequence of

00:28:42.516 --> 00:28:44.306 A:middle
words that make up a sentence

00:28:44.536 --> 00:28:45.666 A:middle
and generate a sequence of

00:28:45.666 --> 00:28:48.996 A:middle
outputs which is a same sentence

00:28:49.296 --> 00:28:50.586 A:middle
but translated to a different

00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:51.096 A:middle
language.

00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:52.166 A:middle
For example, to ration or

00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:52.596 A:middle
finish.

00:28:53.186 --> 00:28:56.146 A:middle
With support, a number of

00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:57.416 A:middle
different variance of RNNs.

00:28:58.426 --> 00:29:00.306 A:middle
The most commonly used one is
