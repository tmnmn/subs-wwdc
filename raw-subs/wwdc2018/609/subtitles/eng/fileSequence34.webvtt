00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:01.286 A:middle
for both the forward and

00:34:01.286 --> 00:34:02.146 A:middle
gradient passes.

00:34:02.446 --> 00:34:03.926 A:middle
You will need 20 matrices for

00:34:03.926 --> 00:34:05.906 A:middle
each one of those.

00:34:05.906 --> 00:34:06.896 A:middle
And here is how you would

00:34:06.896 --> 00:34:08.496 A:middle
initialize these matrices with

00:34:08.536 --> 00:34:08.746 A:middle
data.

00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:13.346 A:middle
And now, we are ready to train

00:34:13.346 --> 00:34:14.906 A:middle
our activity classifier network

00:34:15.346 --> 00:34:15.795 A:middle
in MPS.

00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:17.516 A:middle
So, in this code example, I will

00:34:17.516 --> 00:34:19.335 A:middle
be highlighting only the LSTM

00:34:19.335 --> 00:34:23.246 A:middle
filter in the interest of time.

00:34:23.406 --> 00:34:24.976 A:middle
So, in the forward pass, we ran

00:34:24.976 --> 00:34:26.585 A:middle
a sequence of 20 matrices

00:34:26.585 --> 00:34:28.196 A:middle
forward through the LSTM

00:34:28.196 --> 00:34:28.806 A:middle
training layer.

00:34:29.726 --> 00:34:30.735 A:middle
And then in the backward pass,

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:33.166 A:middle
we ran a sequence of 20 matrices

00:34:33.275 --> 00:34:34.936 A:middle
though the LSTM layer to compute

00:34:34.936 --> 00:34:35.545 A:middle
gradients.

00:34:36.676 --> 00:34:38.706 A:middle
And now, you have the training

00:34:38.706 --> 00:34:39.755 A:middle
weights, and you have the

00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:41.406 A:middle
computed gradients, and you can

00:34:41.406 --> 00:34:43.186 A:middle
pass them to an optimizer to

00:34:43.186 --> 00:34:43.926 A:middle
update weights.

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:46.896 A:middle
So, there's just one more thing

00:34:46.896 --> 00:34:47.786 A:middle
I'd like to mention.

00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:50.735 A:middle
[Inaudible] neural networks

00:34:50.735 --> 00:34:53.676 A:middle
operate on images and LSTMs

00:34:53.676 --> 00:34:54.886 A:middle
operate on matrices.

00:34:55.946 --> 00:34:57.316 A:middle
And we'll provide convenience

00:34:57.316 --> 00:34:59.616 A:middle
kernels in the framework to make

00:34:59.616 --> 00:35:00.966 A:middle
it easy to convert between
