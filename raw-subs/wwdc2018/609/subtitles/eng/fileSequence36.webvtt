00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:00.966 A:middle
love to show you a demo of that

00:36:00.966 --> 00:36:01.476 A:middle
in action.

00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:03.276 A:middle
Specifically, we want to show

00:36:03.276 --> 00:36:04.706 A:middle
you a demo of training the

00:36:04.706 --> 00:36:06.006 A:middle
InceptionV3 Object

00:36:06.006 --> 00:36:08.566 A:middle
Classification Network, using

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:11.736 A:middle
TensorFlow, powered by MPS.

00:36:11.806 --> 00:36:15.396 A:middle
So, for this demo, I will again

00:36:15.396 --> 00:36:17.216 A:middle
be using a MacBook Pro with an

00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:18.456 A:middle
attached external GPU.

00:36:19.006 --> 00:36:20.856 A:middle
So, I will be running TensorFlow

00:36:21.216 --> 00:36:24.336 A:middle
on this MacBook Pro, and I will

00:36:24.336 --> 00:36:25.876 A:middle
use an external GPU to train a

00:36:25.876 --> 00:36:27.446 A:middle
network using MPS.

00:36:27.836 --> 00:36:29.806 A:middle
So, in this demo setup, I've

00:36:29.806 --> 00:36:32.116 A:middle
already imported TensorFlow and

00:36:32.496 --> 00:36:34.276 A:middle
preloaded the InceptionV3

00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:35.986 A:middle
Network and a training data set.

00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.226 A:middle
So, now, let's train this

00:36:37.286 --> 00:36:39.376 A:middle
network for 30 iterations.

00:36:39.376 --> 00:36:42.516 A:middle
So, you can see how fast this is

00:36:42.516 --> 00:36:42.896 A:middle
going.

00:36:43.476 --> 00:36:45.076 A:middle
Again, the entire network, all

00:36:45.076 --> 00:36:46.066 A:middle
of the primitives, the

00:36:46.066 --> 00:36:47.506 A:middle
optimizer, and the weight update

00:36:47.506 --> 00:36:49.316 A:middle
step, everything is running on

00:36:49.316 --> 00:36:50.266 A:middle
the external GPU.

00:36:50.726 --> 00:36:51.816 A:middle
And we're already done.

00:36:52.516 --> 00:36:54.266 A:middle
And as you can see, the training

00:36:54.266 --> 00:36:56.576 A:middle
rate is approximately 100 images

00:36:56.606 --> 00:36:57.086 A:middle
per second.

00:36:57.546 --> 00:36:58.906 A:middle
So, as was stated in the

00:36:59.336 --> 00:37:00.736 A:middle
platform State of the Union,
