00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.266 A:middle
now take a look at the inputs we

00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:01.386 A:middle
need to pass to the graph.

00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:03.966 A:middle
And for this, let's take a look

00:14:03.966 --> 00:14:05.546 A:middle
at the encode call we will use

00:14:05.816 --> 00:14:07.266 A:middle
to encode the graph to the GPU.

00:14:08.296 --> 00:14:09.886 A:middle
So, as I already mentioned,

00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:11.636 A:middle
we're not going to send in one

00:14:11.676 --> 00:14:13.026 A:middle
image at a time for training.

00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.926 A:middle
We're going to operate on groups

00:14:14.926 --> 00:14:16.236 A:middle
or batches of images.

00:14:16.576 --> 00:14:17.856 A:middle
So, one of the inputs to the

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.536 A:middle
graph, is a batch of images.

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.746 A:middle
And as you recall, for every

00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:24.566 A:middle
batch of images, we also need a

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:26.346 A:middle
corresponding batch of labels

00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:27.446 A:middle
for loss computation.

00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:31.836 A:middle
The labels for loss computation

00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:33.366 A:middle
are passed to the graph as

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:33.786 A:middle
states.

00:14:34.226 --> 00:14:36.536 A:middle
So, the code call also takes a

00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:37.786 A:middle
batch of states as input.

00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:40.496 A:middle
And now, let's talk about these

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:41.406 A:middle
batches and states.

00:14:41.936 --> 00:14:42.456 A:middle
What are they?

00:14:42.596 --> 00:14:43.516 A:middle
Let's start with batches.

00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:46.496 A:middle
So, batches are just arrays of

00:14:46.756 --> 00:14:47.996 A:middle
images or states.

00:14:48.286 --> 00:14:49.416 A:middle
We've added them this year

00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:50.676 A:middle
specifically to support

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:51.086 A:middle
training.

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:53.416 A:middle
There are two new MPS types for

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:56.376 A:middle
you to use: MPSImageBatch and

00:14:56.376 --> 00:14:57.696 A:middle
MPSStateBatch.

00:14:58.266 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
So, here's an example of how you
