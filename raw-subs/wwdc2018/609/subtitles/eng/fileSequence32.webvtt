00:31:59.036 --> 00:32:02.216 A:middle
And now, for training, we do the

00:32:02.216 --> 00:32:03.696 A:middle
forward pass through the

00:32:03.696 --> 00:32:06.296 A:middle
network, then we compute loss,

00:32:07.646 --> 00:32:09.756 A:middle
and we do the gradient pass to

00:32:09.756 --> 00:32:11.096 A:middle
compute gradients that will be

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:12.126 A:middle
used to update weights.

00:32:12.686 --> 00:32:14.386 A:middle
So, this is a very similar setup

00:32:15.316 --> 00:32:16.866 A:middle
that we have for a CNN training.

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:18.406 A:middle
And the last step is of course

00:32:18.406 --> 00:32:20.466 A:middle
to update the weights and as you

00:32:20.466 --> 00:32:22.236 A:middle
know, the LSTM also has weights,

00:32:22.236 --> 00:32:24.366 A:middle
so they need to be updated as

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:25.606 A:middle
well.

00:32:26.076 --> 00:32:27.286 A:middle
And now, let's take a look at

00:32:27.286 --> 00:32:29.856 A:middle
how to train this network in

00:32:29.926 --> 00:32:30.116 A:middle
MPS.

00:32:30.116 --> 00:32:31.826 A:middle
But first, let's take a look at

00:32:31.826 --> 00:32:33.756 A:middle
how we can create LSTM layer for

00:32:33.756 --> 00:32:35.436 A:middle
training using our framework.

00:32:36.306 --> 00:32:38.036 A:middle
So, first, you need to create

00:32:38.036 --> 00:32:39.396 A:middle
LSTM layer descriptor.

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:42.536 A:middle
And we initialize the descriptor

00:32:42.536 --> 00:32:44.106 A:middle
with initial training parameters

00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:45.996 A:middle
using data source providers.

00:32:46.526 --> 00:32:47.556 A:middle
So, these initial training

00:32:47.586 --> 00:32:49.066 A:middle
parameters are, use smaller

00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:50.746 A:middle
random number or some checkpoint

00:32:50.746 --> 00:32:51.196 A:middle
values.

00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:53.576 A:middle
The descriptor setup for

00:32:53.576 --> 00:32:55.826 A:middle
training, is exactly the same as

00:32:55.826 --> 00:32:56.776 A:middle
it is for inference.

00:32:58.646 --> 00:33:00.656 A:middle
And we discussed the layer
