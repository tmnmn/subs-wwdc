00:11:59.796 --> 00:12:01.356 A:middle
It takes a single line of code

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:03.176 A:middle
to create a gradient node from

00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:03.856 A:middle
the forward node.

00:12:04.226 --> 00:12:05.976 A:middle
So, here is an example of how

00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:07.296 A:middle
you can create a gradient

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:08.746 A:middle
convolution node from the

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:10.266 A:middle
convolution node.

00:12:12.656 --> 00:12:14.376 A:middle
And now, let's build an entire

00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:14.796 A:middle
graph.

00:12:16.206 --> 00:12:18.016 A:middle
So, here we have a very small

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:18.476 A:middle
network.

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:19.946 A:middle
We have a convolution node

00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:21.226 A:middle
followed by a pooling node,

00:12:21.356 --> 00:12:22.776 A:middle
followed by another convolution

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:22.976 A:middle
node.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:25.116 A:middle
So, how do we connect these

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:27.356 A:middle
nodes into a graph?

00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:28.886 A:middle
So, that's easy.

00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:32.396 A:middle
We take the result node of --

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:34.796 A:middle
the result image of one node and

00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:36.926 A:middle
pass it as a source image to the

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:37.776 A:middle
subsequent node.

00:12:38.976 --> 00:12:40.306 A:middle
And here we have an entire

00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:41.576 A:middle
connected graph.

00:12:42.716 --> 00:12:44.416 A:middle
And now, let's build a training

00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:44.806 A:middle
graph.

00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:47.776 A:middle
So first, we need to add a loss

00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:49.956 A:middle
node to the graph.

00:12:50.056 --> 00:12:51.516 A:middle
And now, let's add some gradient

00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:51.776 A:middle
nodes.

00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:53.386 A:middle
So, as I said, it takes a single

00:12:53.386 --> 00:12:54.866 A:middle
line of code to create a

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:56.766 A:middle
gradient node from its

00:12:56.766 --> 00:12:58.466 A:middle
corresponding forward node.

00:12:58.466 --> 00:12:59.526 A:middle
And then we connect them as

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
previously, and now you have a
