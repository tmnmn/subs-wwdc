00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:00.106 A:middle
We talked extensively about

00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:01.956 A:middle
inference in our past WWDC

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:03.416 A:middle
sessions, so I just want to

00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:05.316 A:middle
highlight them here.

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:08.466 A:middle
And this year, we've also added

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.326 A:middle
support for training on both iOS

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:10.896 A:middle
and macOS.

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:15.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:16.376 A:middle
Thank you.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.136 A:middle
We've also added support for

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.586 A:middle
accelerated ray tracing on our

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.946 A:middle
platform, and we had an entire

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:25.936 A:middle
session on this topic earlier

00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:26.406 A:middle
this week.

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:28.026 A:middle
So, it was titled Metal for Ray

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:29.136 A:middle
Tracing Acceleration.

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:31.666 A:middle
And the video for the session

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.686 A:middle
will be available online

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:33.086 A:middle
shortly.

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:35.846 A:middle
In this session, I will talk

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:36.996 A:middle
primarily about machine

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.886 A:middle
learning, specifically training.

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:43.206 A:middle
So, I mentioned training and

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:43.586 A:middle
inference.

00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:46.316 A:middle
Deep learning algorithms consist

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:47.256 A:middle
of these two phases.

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:49.086 A:middle
The first phase is the training

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:49.476 A:middle
phase.

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:52.096 A:middle
So, let's use an example where

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:53.866 A:middle
we want to train a model, to

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.756 A:middle
categorize images into classes

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:58.056 A:middle
like cats, dogs, giraffes,

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:58.536 A:middle
etcetera.
