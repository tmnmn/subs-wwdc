00:14:58.266 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
So, here's an example of how you

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:01.966 A:middle
can create a single image, using

00:15:01.966 --> 00:15:02.696 A:middle
our API.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.536 A:middle
So, here we're creating one from

00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:06.736 A:middle
an existing Metal texture.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.646 A:middle
And this is an example of how

00:15:09.646 --> 00:15:11.206 A:middle
you can create a batch of

00:15:11.206 --> 00:15:13.676 A:middle
images, using our API and append

00:15:13.676 --> 00:15:15.116 A:middle
a new image to the batch, so you

00:15:15.116 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
can pass it to the graph.

00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:20.316 A:middle
And now, what are state objects?

00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:23.976 A:middle
An MPS state is an opaque data

00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:24.446 A:middle
container.

00:15:24.446 --> 00:15:27.356 A:middle
In training, it's frequently

00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:29.366 A:middle
used to capture a state of a

00:15:29.366 --> 00:15:32.366 A:middle
forward node, when it's called.

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:35.206 A:middle
And so, it can later be used by

00:15:35.206 --> 00:15:35.996 A:middle
the gradient node.

00:15:37.106 --> 00:15:39.036 A:middle
So, the graph manages all of the

00:15:39.036 --> 00:15:39.776 A:middle
state objects.

00:15:39.776 --> 00:15:41.056 A:middle
So, as a developer, you

00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:42.286 A:middle
generally don't need to worry

00:15:42.286 --> 00:15:42.996 A:middle
about states.

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:44.366 A:middle
But it's nice to know how they

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:44.716 A:middle
work.

00:15:44.876 --> 00:15:46.196 A:middle
So, let's use a specific

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:46.686 A:middle
example.

00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:50.116 A:middle
So, let's go back to our

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.476 A:middle
handwritten digit recognition

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:51.876 A:middle
network.

00:15:52.886 --> 00:15:55.096 A:middle
And take a look specifically at

00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:56.416 A:middle
the drop-out and drop-out

00:15:56.416 --> 00:15:57.956 A:middle
gradient nodes.
