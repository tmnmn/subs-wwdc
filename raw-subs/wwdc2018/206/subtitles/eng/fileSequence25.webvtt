00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:00.516 A:middle
handles execution.

00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:02.876 A:middle
If it doesn't, or if the Watch

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:05.346 A:middle
app is not installed, the

00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:07.536 A:middle
shortcut executes on the phone,

00:25:07.726 --> 00:25:08.426 A:middle
over Internet.

00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:13.146 A:middle
A subset of relevant shortcuts

00:25:13.146 --> 00:25:14.516 A:middle
can surface on the Siri Watch

00:25:14.516 --> 00:25:16.736 A:middle
face, without Watch OS support.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:19.606 A:middle
If they are intent-based

00:25:19.676 --> 00:25:21.566 A:middle
shortcuts that support running

00:25:21.566 --> 00:25:23.516 A:middle
in the background and can run

00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:24.796 A:middle
without accessing encrypted

00:25:24.796 --> 00:25:26.326 A:middle
data, which is separate from

00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:26.576 A:middle
off.

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.446 A:middle
Again, these shortcuts are going

00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:31.436 A:middle
to execute on iPhone over

00:25:31.436 --> 00:25:31.716 A:middle
Internet.

00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:34.396 A:middle
The richest experience for users

00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:35.686 A:middle
will always be with a Watch app

00:25:35.686 --> 00:25:36.916 A:middle
that can handle the shortcut

00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:39.386 A:middle
locally, either by launching the

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:41.076 A:middle
app or by executing the intent

00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:44.256 A:middle
in the background.

00:25:44.326 --> 00:25:45.496 A:middle
You'll want to update your

00:25:45.496 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
relevant shortcuts periodically.

00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:49.026 A:middle
If the user launches your app,

00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:51.066 A:middle
for example, by tapping one of

00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:52.446 A:middle
your shortcuts on the Siri face,

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:54.396 A:middle
you'll have the run time to

00:25:54.396 --> 00:25:55.426 A:middle
accomplish the update.

00:25:56.456 --> 00:25:57.606 A:middle
But shortcuts that provide

00:25:57.606 --> 00:25:59.146 A:middle
glanceable data are useful to

00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
the user without launching the
