00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
with the same thread ID as they

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:01.556 A:middle
come in.

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:03.736 A:middle
If you're handling grouping and

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:04.926 A:middle
the dynamic interface for your

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:06.596 A:middle
notification category, all the

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:08.116 A:middle
messages with the same thread ID

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:09.996 A:middle
will expand to a single platter

00:05:10.146 --> 00:05:11.466 A:middle
when the user taps on the group

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:12.686 A:middle
and Notification Center.

00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:15.216 A:middle
And if additional messages on

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:16.646 A:middle
that thread come in, they'll be

00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:18.306 A:middle
appended live is when the long

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:19.476 A:middle
look was first on screen.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:25.366 A:middle
So, here's a big one.

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:28.406 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, you can now bring

00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:29.776 A:middle
some of your apps' functionality

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.446 A:middle
directly into the notifications

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.356 A:middle
you send by including elements

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:34.756 A:middle
that let the user interact with

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:36.306 A:middle
content in the notification

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:36.746 A:middle
itself.

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:40.546 A:middle
For example, you could let a

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:42.136 A:middle
user pay for their ride and rate

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:44.096 A:middle
their driver, notify a user that

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:45.566 A:middle
their meter is about to expire,

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:46.456 A:middle
and let them extend their

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:48.616 A:middle
parking time, or give a diner an

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:50.516 A:middle
opportunity to not only confirm

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.086 A:middle
their dinner reservation, but to

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.206 A:middle
let you know they'll be a party

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.356 A:middle
of three instead of four.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.676 A:middle
So, let's see how all this

00:05:57.676 --> 00:05:58.026 A:middle
works.

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:00.146 A:middle
If you're creating a new
