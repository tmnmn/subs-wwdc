00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:00.066 A:middle
that behave like the ones like

00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
the built-in messages app.

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.086 A:middle
You can now bring more of your

00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:05.946 A:middle
app experience directly into the

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:07.746 A:middle
notification your app delivers

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.606 A:middle
with interactive controls and

00:12:09.686 --> 00:12:10.646 A:middle
action buttons that can be

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.566 A:middle
defined at runtime.

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:14.356 A:middle
And you can also choose to

00:12:14.356 --> 00:12:15.746 A:middle
deliver notifications with the

00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:17.346 A:middle
appropriate level of urgency.

00:12:18.636 --> 00:12:19.426 A:middle
To learn more about

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:23.256 A:middle
notifications you can attend one

00:12:23.256 --> 00:12:24.546 A:middle
of these sessions.

00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:26.906 A:middle
I highly recommend Designing

00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:28.566 A:middle
Notifications, that will give

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:29.746 A:middle
you some great tips for how to

00:12:30.306 --> 00:12:32.546 A:middle
design effective interactive

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:33.406 A:middle
notifications.

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.766 A:middle
Okay, now that we have your

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:40.286 A:middle
user's attention with

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.326 A:middle
notifications, let's turn our

00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:44.086 A:middle
attention to the features we're

00:12:44.086 --> 00:12:45.546 A:middle
adding to make your Watch apps

00:12:45.546 --> 00:12:46.136 A:middle
more awesome.

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:48.996 A:middle
The first has to do with local

00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:49.756 A:middle
audio playback.

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:53.346 A:middle
Some of you have already made

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:55.116 A:middle
forays into audio playback on

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:56.726 A:middle
the Watch by taking advantage of

00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:58.216 A:middle
URL session for downloading

00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.116 A:middle
files to the Watch.

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:01.526 A:middle
And WK audio file queue player
