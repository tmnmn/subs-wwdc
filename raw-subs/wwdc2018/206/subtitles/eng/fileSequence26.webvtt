00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
the user without launching the

00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:00.566 A:middle
app.

00:26:01.216 --> 00:26:02.706 A:middle
Think about the carrot whether

00:26:02.706 --> 00:26:03.986 A:middle
example from a couple slides

00:26:03.986 --> 00:26:05.496 A:middle
ago, were you could tell that it

00:26:05.496 --> 00:26:07.666 A:middle
was 72 degrees and cloudy just

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:08.676 A:middle
by looking at the platter.

00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:09.626 A:middle
You didn't have to tap.

00:26:11.246 --> 00:26:13.586 A:middle
To help with this case, we added

00:26:13.586 --> 00:26:15.366 A:middle
a background refresh task called

00:26:15.366 --> 00:26:16.666 A:middle
WKRelevantShortcut

00:26:16.736 --> 00:26:18.056 A:middle
RefreshBackgroundTask.

00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:20.986 A:middle
When you get this task before

00:26:21.076 --> 00:26:22.836 A:middle
sure to check if your data needs

00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:24.956 A:middle
to be updated and then supply

00:26:24.956 --> 00:26:25.956 A:middle
new relevant shortcuts.

00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:29.486 A:middle
We factor in user engagement

00:26:29.486 --> 00:26:30.986 A:middle
when scheduling these background

00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:34.256 A:middle
tasks and glances count as

00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:34.736 A:middle
engagement.

00:26:38.456 --> 00:26:40.086 A:middle
If you have an intent-based

00:26:40.086 --> 00:26:41.696 A:middle
shortcut, your intent might

00:26:41.696 --> 00:26:43.676 A:middle
update applications when it

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:45.066 A:middle
executes in the background.

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.516 A:middle
Since the intents extension is

00:26:48.646 --> 00:26:50.026 A:middle
in a separate process from your

00:26:50.026 --> 00:26:51.906 A:middle
Watch Kit extension, we're now

00:26:51.906 --> 00:26:53.346 A:middle
supplying a new refresh

00:26:53.376 --> 00:26:54.756 A:middle
background task called

00:26:54.816 --> 00:26:56.616 A:middle
WKIntentDidRun

00:26:56.696 --> 00:26:58.856 A:middle
RefreshBackgroundTask to let

00:26:58.856 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
your main extension run and
