00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
playing elsewhere on a system,

00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:01.836 A:middle
whether it's on a Watch or on

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.476 A:middle
phone, as in the workout app,

00:16:04.786 --> 00:16:06.236 A:middle
where you can swipe left during

00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.466 A:middle
a workout to see now playing

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:07.946 A:middle
controls.

00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:09.936 A:middle
You'll be happy to hear that

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.196 A:middle
were exposing a now playing view

00:16:12.196 --> 00:16:14.956 A:middle
that you can embed in your apps.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:17.886 A:middle
You can find the now playing

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:19.186 A:middle
view in the object library in

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.066 A:middle
interface builder.

00:16:20.926 --> 00:16:22.086 A:middle
It's designed to fill the

00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:22.786 A:middle
screen.

00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:24.496 A:middle
So, it works best in apps with

00:16:24.576 --> 00:16:25.356 A:middle
page layouts.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:27.856 A:middle
Note that the now playing view

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:29.376 A:middle
is a systemwide control that's

00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:31.076 A:middle
meant to control audio coming

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:31.966 A:middle
from other apps.

00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:33.356 A:middle
So, it will show whatever the

00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:34.736 A:middle
user is currently listening to,

00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:36.186 A:middle
whether it's on Apple Watch or

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:37.216 A:middle
iPhone.

00:16:39.576 --> 00:16:41.396 A:middle
While we're here, I want to

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:42.476 A:middle
point out a couple of other new

00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:43.796 A:middle
options and one change in

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:44.446 A:middle
behavior.

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:47.236 A:middle
In previous versions of WatchOS,

00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
if you added a 38-millimeter

00:16:49.236 --> 00:16:50.826 A:middle
asset but forgot to add the same

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:52.346 A:middle
asset for a 42-millimeter

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.186 A:middle
device, the asset would be

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:55.936 A:middle
missing on the larger device.

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:58.236 A:middle
Now it will automatically fall

00:16:58.236 --> 00:16:59.946 A:middle
back to the 38 millimeter size
