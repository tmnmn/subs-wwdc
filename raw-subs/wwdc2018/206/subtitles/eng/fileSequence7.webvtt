00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:02.006 A:middle
You can even add gesture

00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:02.946 A:middle
recognizers with your

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:04.526 A:middle
notification, though you should

00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:05.666 A:middle
be aware that the system

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:07.596 A:middle
gestures will take precedence

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:09.286 A:middle
over any gestures you add in the

00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:09.976 A:middle
same areas.

00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:17.526 A:middle
Once you've designed your

00:07:17.526 --> 00:07:19.326 A:middle
notification interface wire up

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
the interactive elements to your

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:21.786 A:middle
code, the way you would any

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
other interactive element in

00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.226 A:middle
your app.

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:26.426 A:middle
As you can see here, I'm

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.576 A:middle
dragging my IB action for up

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.456 A:middle
button tapped to the button in

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:31.546 A:middle
my dynamic interactive

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:32.096 A:middle
interface.

00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:33.346 A:middle
So, the amount of time will

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.136 A:middle
increase by 15 minutes every

00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:39.106 A:middle
time the button is tapped.

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.626 A:middle
And with all this button tapping

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:42.186 A:middle
you may have already forgotten

00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:43.706 A:middle
that notifications have always

00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:45.036 A:middle
launched your app when tapped.

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:49.026 A:middle
This is still true for a regular

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:50.086 A:middle
dynamic and static

00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:51.146 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.066 A:middle
But, we obviously had to disable

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.476 A:middle
this behavior for dynamic

00:07:54.476 --> 00:07:56.176 A:middle
interactive notifications.

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:57.236 A:middle
Because we have interactive

00:07:57.236 --> 00:07:57.966 A:middle
elements in them now.

00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
You can still launch your app
