00:17:00.076 --> 00:17:01.726 A:middle
if the 42 millimeter size is

00:17:01.726 --> 00:17:02.136 A:middle
missing.

00:17:02.736 --> 00:17:05.915 A:middle
But you can skip worrying about

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:07.336 A:middle
providing assets of different

00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:09.486 A:middle
sizes altogether by instead

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:12.046 A:middle
adding a PDF in the universal

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:13.935 A:middle
selection of your asset catalog

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:16.086 A:middle
and setting the new auto scaling

00:17:16.086 --> 00:17:17.695 A:middle
option to automatic.

00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:25.246 A:middle
This will cause the right sized

00:17:25.476 --> 00:17:26.606 A:middle
asset to show up at the right

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:30.466 A:middle
place at the right time.

00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:32.186 A:middle
We've also exposed the title

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:34.106 A:middle
textiles in the font menu to

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:35.206 A:middle
give you more options for

00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.566 A:middle
differentiating your text within

00:17:37.566 --> 00:17:38.306 A:middle
your interfaces.

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:40.926 A:middle
These textiles are compatible

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.006 A:middle
with dynamic type, so they'll

00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:44.436 A:middle
increase or decrease.

00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:45.896 A:middle
They'll scale up and down, as

00:17:45.896 --> 00:17:47.336 A:middle
the user changes their font size

00:17:47.336 --> 00:17:47.866 A:middle
in settings.

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:51.786 A:middle
And the large title style is

00:17:51.786 --> 00:17:53.196 A:middle
available in both interface

00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:54.386 A:middle
builder and as an API.

00:17:58.456 --> 00:17:59.906 A:middle
Since I'm in the process of

00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.116 A:middle
building an app for skating
