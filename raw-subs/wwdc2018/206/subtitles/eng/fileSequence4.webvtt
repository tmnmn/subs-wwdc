00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
notifications that have a

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.816 A:middle
matching category and thread ID

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.986 A:middle
arrive, did receive notification

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:05.296 A:middle
will be called again on the

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:06.856 A:middle
existing notification interface

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:07.386 A:middle
controller.

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:10.066 A:middle
So, you should be prepared to

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.686 A:middle
append content to the existing

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:12.856 A:middle
notification interface.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:14.936 A:middle
Perhaps by adding a blank line

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:16.696 A:middle
and the new body content to an

00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:17.505 A:middle
existing label.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.076 A:middle
Or by adding a new row to a

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
table, as you saw on the

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:21.125 A:middle
previous example.

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
And speaking of did receive

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.216 A:middle
notification, its signature has

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.556 A:middle
changed in WatchOS 5.

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:30.556 A:middle
This version, with the

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:31.896 A:middle
completion handler has been

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.196 A:middle
deprecated, in favor of this

00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:36.286 A:middle
simplified version.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.356 A:middle
We did this, so we'd have a

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:39.616 A:middle
clear boundary for when you're

00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:40.686 A:middle
done processing your

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:41.676 A:middle
notification data.

00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:43.116 A:middle
And we'd know that everything is

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.326 A:middle
ready to be shown on screen.

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:47.166 A:middle
We encourage you to do only the

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.126 A:middle
work necessary to display the

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.176 A:middle
notification and to do it as

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:52.196 A:middle
quickly as possible.

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:56.516 A:middle
By the way, it's not necessary

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.896 A:middle
for the user to keep their wrist

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.636 A:middle
up to see all the notifications

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
with the same thread ID as they
