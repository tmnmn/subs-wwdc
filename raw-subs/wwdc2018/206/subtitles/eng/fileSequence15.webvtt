pause, to next and previous, to

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.966 A:middle
even like and dislike.

00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:06.716 A:middle
And last, but not least, it's

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.136 A:middle
now possible to control the

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:10.006 A:middle
volume from your custom playback

00:15:10.006 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
UI with the new volume control

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:12.436 A:middle
view.

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:14.846 A:middle
Available in the object library

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:15.706 A:middle
and interface builder.

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:19.226 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:19.726 --> 00:15:21.216 A:middle
The control automatically takes

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:22.656 A:middle
on the tint color of your app

00:15:22.656 --> 00:15:24.626 A:middle
when at rest and responds with

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.016 A:middle
the color changes you're used to

00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.656 A:middle
from the system volume control

00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:29.166 A:middle
when turning the digital crown.

00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:34.086 A:middle
There's a whole session devoted

00:15:34.086 --> 00:15:35.546 A:middle
to creating audio apps for

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:38.066 A:middle
WatchOS which I highly encourage

00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:39.816 A:middle
you to attend to get more

00:15:39.816 --> 00:15:41.746 A:middle
details about the new APIs and

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.286 A:middle
best practices for working with

00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:43.676 A:middle
audio.

00:15:43.816 --> 00:15:45.586 A:middle
And we'll also be prepared to

00:15:45.586 --> 00:15:47.056 A:middle
talk about background audio at

00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:48.356 A:middle
the WatchOS runtime and

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:49.836 A:middle
conductivity lab on Thursday.

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:54.166 A:middle
If the primary function of your

00:15:54.416 --> 00:15:55.976 A:middle
app isn't playing audio, but

00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:57.226 A:middle
your app would benefit from

00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:58.736 A:middle
being able to control audio

00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
playing elsewhere on a system,
