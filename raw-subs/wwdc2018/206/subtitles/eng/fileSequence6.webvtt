00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:00.146 A:middle
If you're creating a new

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:01.186 A:middle
notification interface

00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:02.676 A:middle
controller, a dynamic

00:06:02.676 --> 00:06:04.036 A:middle
interactive interface will be

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:05.606 A:middle
created for you automatically.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:09.326 A:middle
If you already have a dynamic

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:10.566 A:middle
interface for your notification

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:12.846 A:middle
category, select the category in

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:13.876 A:middle
your Watch App's interface

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.536 A:middle
storyboard and check that has

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.446 A:middle
interactive interface box.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.666 A:middle
In both cases, you'll notice

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.136 A:middle
that the old dynamic interface

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:26.596 A:middle
is still there, in addition to

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:27.976 A:middle
the dynamic interactive one.

00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:30.206 A:middle
The dynamic interface will be

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:31.606 A:middle
shown in WatchOS 5 when the

00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.256 A:middle
notification first arrives, and

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:34.946 A:middle
now in Notification Center as

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:36.206 A:middle
well, as I mentioned before.

00:06:36.976 --> 00:06:38.906 A:middle
The dynamic interface will be

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:40.216 A:middle
shown in earlier versions of

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:41.786 A:middle
WatchOS so, you'll want to keep

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:42.956 A:middle
that one around for backwards

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:43.686 A:middle
compatibility.

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:47.846 A:middle
Once you have a dynamic

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:49.236 A:middle
interactive interface controller

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.316 A:middle
you can add buttons, switches

00:06:51.316 --> 00:06:52.566 A:middle
and other interactive elements

00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:53.936 A:middle
in the object library, which is

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.286 A:middle
now available at the top of the

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:56.816 A:middle
screen as a popover menu.

00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:02.006 A:middle
You can even add gesture
