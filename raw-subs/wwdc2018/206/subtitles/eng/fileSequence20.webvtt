00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.186 A:middle
with Siri Shortcuts.

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:03.486 A:middle
As you saw on the keynote, Siri

00:20:03.486 --> 00:20:04.756 A:middle
Shortcuts are meant to help

00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:06.286 A:middle
users accomplish tasks that they

00:20:06.286 --> 00:20:08.156 A:middle
perform frequently with more

00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:09.356 A:middle
ease than ever before.

00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.976 A:middle
And the Siri Watch face surfaces

00:20:12.976 --> 00:20:14.376 A:middle
these, the common tasks, at the

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:16.176 A:middle
right place and time with a

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:17.846 A:middle
little input from you as app

00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:18.466 A:middle
developers.

00:20:19.806 --> 00:20:20.986 A:middle
I want to focus on how to use

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.566 A:middle
shortcuts to make a great Watch

00:20:22.566 --> 00:20:23.826 A:middle
experience and how that

00:20:23.826 --> 00:20:25.506 A:middle
experience differs depending on

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:26.406 A:middle
whether your Watch app is

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:26.896 A:middle
installed.

00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:30.996 A:middle
First, a few words about what

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:31.866 A:middle
makes a good shortcut.

00:20:33.156 --> 00:20:35.006 A:middle
As the name implies, shortcuts

00:20:35.006 --> 00:20:36.396 A:middle
are about helping Watch users

00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.476 A:middle
see useful information and

00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:40.006 A:middle
perform common tasks quickly.

00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:41.916 A:middle
Whether it's launching your app

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.096 A:middle
to a specific screen with

00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:45.326 A:middle
options preselected, or getting

00:20:45.326 --> 00:20:47.116 A:middle
to the awesome outcome your app

00:20:47.116 --> 00:20:48.716 A:middle
enables, such as ordering your

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:50.576 A:middle
morning coffee, booking a fine

00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:52.496 A:middle
dining reservation, or re-upping

00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:53.466 A:middle
your chocolate supply.

00:20:54.716 --> 00:20:55.826 A:middle
Think about glanceable

00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:57.496 A:middle
information and one or two tap

00:20:57.496 --> 00:20:58.206 A:middle
interactions.

00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:02.716 A:middle
Shortcuts can be user activity
