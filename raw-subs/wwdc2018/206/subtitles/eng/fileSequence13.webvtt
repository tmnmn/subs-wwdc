00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:01.526 A:middle
And WK audio file queue player

00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:02.076 A:middle
to play them.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.216 A:middle
With WatchOS 5, we're going to

00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:06.776 A:middle
make developing audio apps for

00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:08.626 A:middle
the Watch even easier, and the

00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:10.196 A:middle
resulting experiences more

00:13:10.196 --> 00:13:10.706 A:middle
delightful.

00:13:13.036 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, we're offering a

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.866 A:middle
new background mode for playing

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:17.906 A:middle
local audio files.

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:20.106 A:middle
So, you can now focus on your

00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:22.396 A:middle
app's main purpose, audio,

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.326 A:middle
rather than trying to figure out

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:26.206 A:middle
how to build something else like

00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:28.236 A:middle
a workout app just to be able to

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:28.836 A:middle
play audio.

00:13:30.516 --> 00:13:34.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:37.396 A:middle
We also exposed AVAudio player

00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:39.276 A:middle
and AVAudioEngine directly,

00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:40.966 A:middle
which means you can use the same

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:42.126 A:middle
methods and properties you're

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.716 A:middle
already familiar with if you've

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:45.556 A:middle
been building iOS apps that play

00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:45.956 A:middle
audio.

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.536 A:middle
In fact, you can share your code

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.216 A:middle
between your iOS app and your

00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:51.536 A:middle
Watch app by moving your

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:52.796 A:middle
playback related code to a

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:53.286 A:middle
framework.

00:13:53.946 --> 00:13:56.256 A:middle
One thing that's different from

00:13:56.356 --> 00:13:59.446 A:middle
iOS, is that playing longform

00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:00.996 A:middle
audio on the Watch requires
