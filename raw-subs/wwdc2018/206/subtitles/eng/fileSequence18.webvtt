00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.116 A:middle
building an app for skating

00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:02.676 A:middle
workouts, now would be a good

00:18:02.726 --> 00:18:03.596 A:middle
time to talk about the

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:04.866 A:middle
improvements we're making to

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.306 A:middle
workouts in WatchOS 5.

00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:08.726 A:middle
We completely rewrote the

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:10.636 A:middle
workout API in this release to

00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:12.816 A:middle
make it simpler, more reliable,

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:13.776 A:middle
and more resilient.

00:18:14.466 --> 00:18:16.096 A:middle
And we've moved the built-in

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.386 A:middle
workout app to use it.

00:18:18.676 --> 00:18:19.676 A:middle
We're hoping you'll move your

00:18:19.676 --> 00:18:23.246 A:middle
fitness apps to it to.

00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:24.956 A:middle
It's now easier than ever to

00:18:24.956 --> 00:18:26.526 A:middle
start a workout and collect the

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:28.116 A:middle
right data with a new

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:30.116 A:middle
initializer from HK workout

00:18:30.336 --> 00:18:33.556 A:middle
session and the new workout

00:18:33.556 --> 00:18:34.076 A:middle
builder API.

00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:37.536 A:middle
You create the workout session,

00:18:38.256 --> 00:18:39.586 A:middle
get the builder from the session

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:41.326 A:middle
and start collecting data.

00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:42.846 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.476 A:middle
This is what it looks like in

00:18:47.236 --> 00:18:47.346 A:middle
code.

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:48.776 A:middle
You create and configure the

00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:50.326 A:middle
session with a health store and

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.186 A:middle
a workout configuration, which

00:18:52.186 --> 00:18:54.046 A:middle
includes the activity type.

00:18:54.656 --> 00:18:56.926 A:middle
Grab the HK live workout builder

00:18:56.926 --> 00:18:57.876 A:middle
that's associated with the

00:18:57.876 --> 00:19:00.606 A:middle
session and begin collection.
