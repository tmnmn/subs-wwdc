00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:01.116 A:middle
And you might already be

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:02.816 A:middle
specifying a thread ID and the

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.116 A:middle
push notifications that get

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.806 A:middle
forwarded from iOS to the Watch.

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:09.856 A:middle
In WatchOS 5, this will cause

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.166 A:middle
notifications to be grouped

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.666 A:middle
automatically in Notification

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.806 A:middle
Center as you saw in the

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:14.456 A:middle
previous slide.

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.906 A:middle
Specifying a category and thread

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.356 A:middle
ID also opens up another

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:20.086 A:middle
possibility.

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.406 A:middle
Getting the same behavior as the

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.306 A:middle
built-in messages app, where new

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:26.726 A:middle
notifications with the same

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.046 A:middle
thread ID that come in when the

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.706 A:middle
original one is still on screen

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:31.586 A:middle
are appended to the existing

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:32.036 A:middle
interface.

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
We made this kind of grouping

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.646 A:middle
behavior optional to give you a

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:37.986 A:middle
chance to handle being called

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:39.446 A:middle
multiple times for the same

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:40.556 A:middle
notification interface

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:40.976 A:middle
controller.

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.466 A:middle
To opt into this behavior,

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:46.896 A:middle
select your notifications

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.666 A:middle
category in the interface

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:51.116 A:middle
storyboard for your Watch app.

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:52.446 A:middle
And check the handle's grouping

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:54.316 A:middle
box in the attributes inspector.

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:57.186 A:middle
If the original notification is

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:58.566 A:middle
on screen when additional

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
notifications that have a
