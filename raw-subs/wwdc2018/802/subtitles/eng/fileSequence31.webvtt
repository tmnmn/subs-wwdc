00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.466 A:middle
a tab bar icon, right?

00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:04.866 A:middle
Except there's a crucial

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:06.456 A:middle
difference in using the notion

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:07.726 A:middle
of home in a tab bar.

00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:12.226 A:middle
To be blunt, an app isn't a

00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:14.656 A:middle
frame containing god knows what.

00:31:15.686 --> 00:31:18.216 A:middle
A typical app offers specific

00:31:18.216 --> 00:31:20.026 A:middle
things, specific contents,

00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:21.746 A:middle
specific tools, specific

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:22.426 A:middle
actions.

00:31:22.746 --> 00:31:24.826 A:middle
And a tab bar is a quick

00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:26.726 A:middle
expression of the overall

00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:28.246 A:middle
utility of your app.

00:31:28.246 --> 00:31:30.066 A:middle
It's a high-level map of your

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:31.433 A:middle
app.

00:31:31.696 --> 00:31:33.676 A:middle
So let's use an example that's

00:31:33.676 --> 00:31:36.016 A:middle
close to home -- the tab bar of

00:31:36.016 --> 00:31:37.866 A:middle
WWDC app.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:41.486 A:middle
So we all can get a quick

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:43.946 A:middle
understanding of the scope of

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:45.596 A:middle
information that's available in

00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:47.226 A:middle
the app simply by scanning the

00:31:47.226 --> 00:31:47.786 A:middle
tab bar.

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:50.196 A:middle
We can guess at what content

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.716 A:middle
might be in each tab.

00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:54.756 A:middle
So tab bar icons and tab bar

00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:56.556 A:middle
labels should be as direct as

00:31:56.556 --> 00:31:57.246 A:middle
possible.

00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:00.086 A:middle
And this directness will then
