work.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=172) [So let's dive in.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=174) [So before mobile devices came](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=177) [around when you traveled abroad](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=179) [around when you traveled abroad](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=179) [you'd carry a paper map.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=181) [And the advantage of the paper](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=183) [map is that when you would](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=185) [approach a local they would](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=186)

needed.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=190) [So mobile maps have made people](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=193) [more independent, right?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=195) [We

real beauty of this](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=332) [is that you can make

[You can get on the right train](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/802/?time=339) [like I did, but you also make
