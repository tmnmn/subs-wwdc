Ontario. Let's try it.

00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:05.236 A:middle
Oh my gosh.

00:35:06.196 --> 00:35:07.796 A:middle
You've done that quiz before,

00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:08.566 A:middle
right?

00:35:09.856 --> 00:35:12.086 A:middle
So the UI of Tinycards is so

00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:13.876 A:middle
clear you don't even think about

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:14.016 A:middle
it.

00:35:14.186 --> 00:35:15.666 A:middle
Working with cards feels

00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.056 A:middle
completely natural and you can

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:18.386 A:middle
just focus on your goal, which

00:35:18.386 --> 00:35:19.266 A:middle
is learning stuff.

00:35:20.616 --> 00:35:22.466 A:middle
So what Tinycards demonstrates

00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:24.336 A:middle
to me is that if you implement a

00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:26.056 A:middle
metaphor well, people will

00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:27.266 A:middle
instantly become immersed.

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:28.386 A:middle
They'll forget that they're even

00:35:28.386 --> 00:35:29.566 A:middle
interacting with a UI.

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:33.026 A:middle
And once they're immersed, you

00:35:33.026 --> 00:35:34.876 A:middle
even have the opportunity to

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:36.926 A:middle
extend the metaphor, to really

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:38.776 A:middle
surprise and even delight

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:39.246 A:middle
people.

00:35:40.066 --> 00:35:41.686 A:middle
So I want to show you a game.

00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:43.856 A:middle
It's called Gorogoa and it

00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.796 A:middle
extends the metaphor of the card

00:35:45.976 --> 00:35:47.536 A:middle
in a way that I feel like

00:35:47.576 --> 00:35:49.216 A:middle
creates a truly unique

00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:50.076 A:middle
experience.

00:35:50.856 --> 00:35:52.806 A:middle
So Gorogoa is a puzzle game.

00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:55.616 A:middle
You move cards around a grid and

00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:57.516 A:middle
you advance in the game and in

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:58.986 A:middle
the story by getting them into

00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.086 A:middle
the right positions.
