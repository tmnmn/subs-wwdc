00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
naturally from what they expect.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.196 A:middle
So I know simple and natural are

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.546 A:middle
sort of designer cliches, we say

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:07.796 A:middle
this stuff all the time.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.256 A:middle
Like, what do we mean?

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.306 A:middle
I think these terms are

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.846 A:middle
shorthand for discussing

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.516 A:middle
qualities of apps that create

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:17.836 A:middle
feelings of comfort and

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:18.706 A:middle
confidence.

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:21.586 A:middle
When people feel comfortable and

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:23.626 A:middle
confident, when we understand

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.276 A:middle
how a thing works, we can move

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.176 A:middle
through it seamlessly without

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:29.706 A:middle
needed to learn or figure it

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:30.946 A:middle
out.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.716 A:middle
So intent is the kind of thing

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.786 A:middle
is hard to define but you know

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:35.496 A:middle
it when you see it.

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.356 A:middle
So I'm going to show you some

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.746 A:middle
examples of apps that I found in

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:41.876 A:middle
the last year that really

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:44.026 A:middle
deliver real value to people and

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:45.166 A:middle
really connect with them.

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.236 A:middle
And I'm going to talk about five

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:50.296 A:middle
elements of intentional design

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.246 A:middle
that we can learn from these

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.736 A:middle
apps and that you can apply to

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:53.146 A:middle
your work.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.766 A:middle
So let's dive in.

00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.876 A:middle
So before mobile devices came

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.516 A:middle
around when you traveled abroad
