00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:00.086 A:middle
And this directness will then

00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:02.896 A:middle
limit what each tab can contain

00:32:02.896 --> 00:32:03.766 A:middle
and that's great.

00:32:04.976 --> 00:32:06.296 A:middle
Directness creates

00:32:06.296 --> 00:32:07.246 A:middle
predictability.

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:09.166 A:middle
So the app may not do

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:12.836 A:middle
everything, right, no app does

00:32:12.836 --> 00:32:13.346 A:middle
everything.

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:15.166 A:middle
But people won't have to hunt

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.466 A:middle
around to figure out what it

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:17.656 A:middle
does and doesn't do.

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.726 A:middle
So when I talk about home I'm

00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:21.816 A:middle
talking about a metaphor,

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:24.816 A:middle
homeland, a home base.

00:32:27.056 --> 00:32:29.186 A:middle
So let's just dig in to why home

00:32:29.256 --> 00:32:29.946 A:middle
doesn't work.

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:32.506 A:middle
First it's overly broad and it

00:32:32.506 --> 00:32:33.516 A:middle
feels generic.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.126 A:middle
And I think it's a copout.

00:32:36.556 --> 00:32:37.996 A:middle
You're avoiding a decision by

00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:39.246 A:middle
naming a tab Home.

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:41.876 A:middle
The perceived comforts of home

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:44.236 A:middle
as an icon in a label are

00:32:44.236 --> 00:32:45.406 A:middle
getting in the way of being

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:47.596 A:middle
direct, of clearly and directly

00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:48.976 A:middle
communicating the scope of

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:50.616 A:middle
what's in your app.

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:53.236 A:middle
If your app is a meditation app

00:32:53.776 --> 00:32:55.796 A:middle
and offers content related to

00:32:55.856 --> 00:32:57.046 A:middle
meditating and building a

00:32:57.046 --> 00:33:01.036 A:middle
meditation practice, imagine the
