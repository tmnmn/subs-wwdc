00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.036 A:middle
yourself in and allows you to

00:30:00.036 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
get out of there.

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:02.896 A:middle
So that notion of home was

00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:04.336 A:middle
extended to iPhone and the

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:05.756 A:middle
behavior is similar.

00:30:06.886 --> 00:30:08.776 A:middle
It's a shortcut, it's an easy

00:30:08.776 --> 00:30:10.406 A:middle
button, home is a starting

00:30:10.406 --> 00:30:13.556 A:middle
place, and unlike in real life,

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:14.926 A:middle
home is a place that you can

00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.056 A:middle
always return to with a simple

00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:17.636 A:middle
gesture.

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:20.646 A:middle
You can go home whenever you

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:21.016 A:middle
want.

00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:24.326 A:middle
So home is also a familiar

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:25.416 A:middle
notion in the finder.

00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:27.206 A:middle
Here the spirit is more like --

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:30.556 A:middle
you followed the river to it's

00:30:30.556 --> 00:30:31.396 A:middle
headwaters.

00:30:32.346 --> 00:30:33.756 A:middle
On the Mac, home represents a

00:30:33.756 --> 00:30:34.526 A:middle
container.

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:36.046 A:middle
Everything is in here.

00:30:36.486 --> 00:30:37.686 A:middle
You don't need to look anywhere

00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:37.986 A:middle
else.

00:30:38.446 --> 00:30:40.866 A:middle
you have reached the source.

00:30:42.736 --> 00:30:45.406 A:middle
Home in these contexts offers

00:30:45.496 --> 00:30:48.236 A:middle
reliability, safety, an ability

00:30:48.236 --> 00:30:50.066 A:middle
to return as you navigate

00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:50.616 A:middle
outward.

00:30:51.076 --> 00:30:54.256 A:middle
And it's clear obvious utility

00:30:54.466 --> 00:30:56.926 A:middle
elsewhere on the platform might

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:58.716 A:middle
seem like a reasonable choice as

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.466 A:middle
a tab bar icon, right?
