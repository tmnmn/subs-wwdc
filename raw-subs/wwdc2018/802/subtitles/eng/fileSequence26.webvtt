00:26:01.156 --> 00:26:03.386 A:middle
So the point isn't to spice up

00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:04.806 A:middle
your copy, right?

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:07.516 A:middle
The point is that spicy copy in

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:08.966 A:middle
the right context feels

00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:09.666 A:middle
memorable.

00:26:12.356 --> 00:26:14.826 A:middle
And it must be said that the

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:16.196 A:middle
personality of Carrot is

00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:17.666 A:middle
probably not for everyone.

00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:20.496 A:middle
And I talked with Brian he

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.636 A:middle
commented on this.

00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:24.336 A:middle
So you can probably imagine the

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.316 A:middle
email and Tweets that he gets

00:26:26.316 --> 00:26:29.786 A:middle
from people who are surprised or

00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:31.846 A:middle
upset or offended by the

00:26:31.846 --> 00:26:33.366 A:middle
forecast after they download the

00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:33.636 A:middle
app.

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:37.026 A:middle
Like, you know, how dare he

00:26:37.026 --> 00:26:39.526 A:middle
insult meteorologists like this?

00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:42.976 A:middle
So he offers an olive branch --

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:45.546 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:48.166 A:middle
To these disgruntled souls.

00:26:48.766 --> 00:26:50.636 A:middle
They can adjust the personality

00:26:50.636 --> 00:26:52.096 A:middle
from the default, which as you

00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:53.496 A:middle
saw was Homicidal.

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:56.196 A:middle
You could go the left for less

00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:58.116 A:middle
edge and to the right for more.

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:02.896 A:middle
But the bottom line just to be
