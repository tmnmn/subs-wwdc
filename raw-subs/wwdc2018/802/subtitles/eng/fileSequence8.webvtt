00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:08.856 A:middle
You can leave feedback in my

00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:09.526 A:middle
session.

00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:14.076 A:middle
So what I love about Vanido is

00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:16.376 A:middle
that it has stripped away what

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:18.606 A:middle
music education looks like,

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:18.846 A:middle
right?

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:20.326 A:middle
There's no charts or notes.

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.666 A:middle
It's colorful, it's animated,

00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:23.496 A:middle
and it's fun.

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:25.766 A:middle
And you should have heard me

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.866 A:middle
sing before I started using this

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:28.086 A:middle
app.

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:29.356 A:middle
It really works.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.806 A:middle
And there's only one interactive

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:33.046 A:middle
element on the screen when

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:34.256 A:middle
you're singing and it's way up

00:08:34.256 --> 00:08:35.826 A:middle
at the top left.

00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:38.506 A:middle
So you can hold your phone like

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:40.336 A:middle
a microphone and really belt it

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.666 A:middle
out without worrying about

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:44.096 A:middle
accidentally exiting your

00:08:44.096 --> 00:08:44.576 A:middle
lesson.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:47.756 A:middle
So this is radical

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:49.656 A:middle
simplification and that's what I

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:50.516 A:middle
mean, that's the first

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.736 A:middle
manifestation of intent and

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:54.116 A:middle
intentional design.

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:57.396 A:middle
Being radical means taking

00:08:57.396 --> 00:08:58.906 A:middle
risks, right?

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.266 A:middle
