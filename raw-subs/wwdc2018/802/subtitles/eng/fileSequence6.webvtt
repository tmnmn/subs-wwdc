00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
going to call radical

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.016 A:middle
simplification.

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:04.646 A:middle
So how did they do this?

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:07.366 A:middle
Well, I think they considered

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.286 A:middle
the context really well, the

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.226 A:middle
context that this will be used

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
in.

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:14.086 A:middle
They took into account where and

00:06:14.086 --> 00:06:15.696 A:middle
when people would pull out their

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:18.326 A:middle
phone and launch their app.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:19.826 A:middle
You're probably in a foreign

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:23.976 A:middle
country, like this guy you're

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:27.936 A:middle
jetlagged, lost, tired, your

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.256 A:middle
hair is uncombed, your jacket is

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:31.856 A:middle
rumpled.

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.106 A:middle
I'm not even sure if that's a

00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:37.156 A:middle
map that he's carrying at this

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:38.466 A:middle
moment, it kind of looks like a

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:38.876 A:middle
book.

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:41.766 A:middle
So they remove the UI and allow

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.996 A:middle
people to focus on what they

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.416 A:middle
need, which is to find

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.336 A:middle
something, to ask a question, to

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:48.056 A:middle
get their bearings.

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:52.936 A:middle
And it's amazing how much an

00:06:52.936 --> 00:06:54.866 A:middle
experience can change when

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:56.756 A:middle
actions are removed from the UI.

00:06:56.756 --> 00:06:58.986 A:middle
So I want to show you another

00:06:58.986 --> 00:06:59.656 A:middle
example.
