00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
And they speak in a language

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:02.376 A:middle
that I didn't speak but the app

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:04.056 A:middle
is smart enough to know that

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:05.466 A:middle
it's ether going to English or

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:07.396 A:middle
Italian to listen for.

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:10.336 A:middle
So the conductor spoke into the

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:11.036 A:middle
microphone.

00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Platform Nine.

00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:16.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And the app translates it for

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
me.

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:20.346 A:middle
So in reality he spoke English.

00:05:21.516 --> 00:05:23.516 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:26.856 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:29.166 A:middle
But he did want to see how the

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:31.206 A:middle
app worked and I showed him and

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:31.916 A:middle
he was impressed.

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:35.876 A:middle
I think the real beauty of this

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:37.496 A:middle
is that you can make a

00:05:37.496 --> 00:05:39.566 A:middle
connection with a person, right?

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.816 A:middle
You can get on the right train

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.076 A:middle
like I did, but you also make a

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.996 A:middle
human connection in the process.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:50.006 A:middle
So the developer's intent here

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:51.666 A:middle
is to enable communication

00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:53.506 A:middle
between two people in real time.

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:55.586 A:middle
Just touch the screen and talk.

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:57.456 A:middle
So the first element of

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:59.796 A:middle
intentional design is what I'm

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
going to call radical
