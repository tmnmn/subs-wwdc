00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.086 A:middle
the right positions.

00:36:00.736 --> 00:36:01.866 A:middle
But you could see that these

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:03.976 A:middle
cards do things that no actual

00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:05.026 A:middle
cards can do.

00:36:05.386 --> 00:36:07.886 A:middle
They can be torn off and as

00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:09.026 A:middle
you'll see in a moment they can

00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:10.366 A:middle
actually stitch themselves

00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:12.756 A:middle
together into a scene.

00:36:18.116 --> 00:36:19.246 A:middle
Yeah, this is an incredible

00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:19.616 A:middle
game.

00:36:20.236 --> 00:36:22.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:24.176 A:middle
And it's a great example of how

00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:25.596 A:middle
you can extend the metaphor

00:36:25.696 --> 00:36:27.386 A:middle
farther than you might think and

00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:29.206 A:middle
create something truly amazing.

00:36:29.686 --> 00:36:31.566 A:middle
This moment right here where

00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:32.976 A:middle
you've got this card metaphor

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:34.396 A:middle
that suddenly kind of

00:36:34.396 --> 00:36:35.966 A:middle
disappears, that's purely

00:36:35.966 --> 00:36:37.906 A:middle
delightful and it's really I

00:36:37.976 --> 00:36:39.966 A:middle
think a great testament to how

00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.266 A:middle
well he's implemented the

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.286 A:middle
metaphor of cards.

00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:47.476 A:middle
Bending and extending metaphors

00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:49.626 A:middle
doesn't work if the result

00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.666 A:middle
doesn't extend the utility, or

00:36:51.666 --> 00:36:53.556 A:middle
value, or delight of your app.

00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:55.806 A:middle
That's why the home tab on the

00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:57.556 A:middle
tab bar doesn't work, right?

00:36:57.556 --> 00:36:59.506 A:middle
It doesn't extend the utility of

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:01.676 A:middle
the app or create any additional
