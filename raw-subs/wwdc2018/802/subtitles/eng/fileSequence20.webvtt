00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
thought you'd already innovated.

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:02.876 A:middle
You weren't worried about this

00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:04.186 A:middle
new patent I'm guessing.

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.446 A:middle
But we all know what happened,

00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:06.736 A:middle
right?

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:08.456 A:middle
The new design became the de

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:10.416 A:middle
facto design of suitcases.

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.526 A:middle
And the improvements in

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:13.846 A:middle
retrospect are totally obvious.

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.656 A:middle
There's a handle at the top so

00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:17.336 A:middle
the whole suitcase it oriented

00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:18.126 A:middle
to be upright.

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:20.326 A:middle
It's easy to grab and pull and

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:20.686 A:middle
pivot.

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:23.036 A:middle
That is the evolution of the

00:20:23.036 --> 00:20:23.566 A:middle
leash.

00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:27.046 A:middle
Second the wheels, right?

00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:28.546 A:middle
The wheels are placed on the

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:29.946 A:middle
edge so they're only fully

00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:31.596 A:middle
engaged when the suitcase is

00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:32.086 A:middle
tilted.

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:35.686 A:middle
And finally the size, it's small

00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:38.006 A:middle
enough to lift and place in an

00:20:38.006 --> 00:20:40.426 A:middle
overhead bin.

00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:42.216 A:middle
So nothing particularly

00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:44.196 A:middle
revolutionary but the inventor

00:20:44.546 --> 00:20:47.166 A:middle
Robert Plath made each decision

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:48.986 A:middle
to serve a really specific

00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:51.716 A:middle
person, a person who traveled

00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:52.386 A:middle
for a living.

00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:54.626 A:middle
Robert Plath was a pilot for

00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:55.716 A:middle
Northwest Airlines.

00:20:55.716 --> 00:20:57.956 A:middle
He intimately knew the pain of

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.306 A:middle
lugging and lifting heavy

00:20:59.306 --> 00:20:59.796 A:middle
things.

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.916 A:middle
He did it every day.
