00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.046 A:middle
So knowing the person that you

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.706 A:middle
want to reach and the actually

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:02.796 A:middle
problem that they have.

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:05.726 A:middle
The deeper you dig the more

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:07.386 A:middle
likely you are to see where the

00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:09.616 A:middle
real opportunity to meet their

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:10.406 A:middle
needs is.

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.196 A:middle
And the app that really shows

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.066 A:middle
this off, in my opinion, is

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.296 A:middle
called Streaks Workout.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.916 A:middle
So it's a workout app but I want

00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.076 A:middle
to go behind the scenes a little

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:19.306 A:middle
bit.

00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:22.176 A:middle
On the surface it looks like

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:23.266 A:middle
many workout apps.

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:24.536 A:middle
It guides your workouts.

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:26.456 A:middle
This is the primary screen and

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:27.426 A:middle
it looks pretty simple.

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:29.536 A:middle
You pick a workout duration and

00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:29.976 A:middle
you go.

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:34.716 A:middle
But personally, I'll confess

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.466 A:middle
that I don't love working out

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:40.826 A:middle
and I've tried many workout apps

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:43.566 A:middle
that I just don't stick with and

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:46.506 A:middle
I want to thank any developers

00:10:46.506 --> 00:10:47.776 A:middle
that are here who have developed

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.456 A:middle
workout apps that I've tried

00:10:49.646 --> 00:10:51.356 A:middle
because I respect your effort

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:55.376 A:middle
and I'm really trying to get fit

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:56.476 A:middle
so thank you for that.

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:58.106 A:middle
But what I struggle with is

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:00.046 A:middle
staying motivated.
