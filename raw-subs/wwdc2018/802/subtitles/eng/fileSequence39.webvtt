block you and focus on people,

00:39:03.356 --> 00:39:03.566 A:middle
right?

00:39:03.566 --> 00:39:04.486 A:middle
The people that you want to

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:06.706 A:middle
serve, the person who inspires

00:39:06.706 --> 00:39:08.446 A:middle
you, the family member who

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.696 A:middle
allows you to be the best

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:12.506 A:middle
version of yourself, the

00:39:12.506 --> 00:39:14.796 A:middle
coworkers with whom you share a

00:39:14.796 --> 00:39:16.686 A:middle
real need for something better,

00:39:16.816 --> 00:39:19.386 A:middle
and you can take that

00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:21.936 A:middle
inspiration and use it to

00:39:21.936 --> 00:39:24.016 A:middle
discover newer and better ways

00:39:24.256 --> 00:39:26.626 A:middle
to connect with people and to

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:28.746 A:middle
create something really great.

00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:33.096 A:middle
So you can check out more about

00:39:33.096 --> 00:39:34.056 A:middle

00:39:34.056 --> 00:39:35.116 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:39:35.196 --> 00:39:40.036 A:middle
And please, please stick around

for the next talk.

00:39:43.796 --> 00:39:45.736 A:middle
The next talk is designing fluid

00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:46.726 A:middle
interfaces.

00:39:47.266 --> 00:39:48.886 A:middle
It's a great talk.

00:39:49.026 --> 00:39:50.986 A:middle
Easily one of the top seven

00:39:50.986 --> 00:39:52.486 A:middle
design talks at this year's

00:39:52.526 --> 00:39:53.236 A:middle
