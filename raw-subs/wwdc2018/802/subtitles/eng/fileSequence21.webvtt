00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.916 A:middle
He did it every day.

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.516 A:middle
And he deeply understood what

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
people like him wanted, to move

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:07.356 A:middle
with ease while looking

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:08.796 A:middle
professional, and he made

00:21:08.826 --> 00:21:10.826 A:middle
something perfectly suited for

00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:11.116 A:middle
that.

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:13.446 A:middle
So what I find really

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:14.356 A:middle
interesting is that at the

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:17.456 A:middle
times, 1989, there were only

00:21:17.456 --> 00:21:18.986 A:middle
about 100,000 travel

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.066 A:middle
professionals as the Census Data

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:22.556 A:middle
called them, but pilots, flight

00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:23.856 A:middle
attendants, people in the travel

00:21:23.856 --> 00:21:24.426 A:middle
industry.

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:26.776 A:middle
That 100,000 might seem like a

00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:28.666 A:middle
lot, but when you compare that

00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:30.986 A:middle
number to the overall market of

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:32.676 A:middle
people who traveled a couple

00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:35.326 A:middle
times a year, just like more

00:21:35.326 --> 00:21:36.696 A:middle
than 100 million at the time,

00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle
and that's just Census Data from

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:42.996 A:middle
the U.S., his target user,

00:21:43.226 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
quote-unquote, was a really

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:47.146 A:middle
specific person that represented

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:50.176 A:middle
only 0.1% of 1% of the market.

00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.506 A:middle
So what I'm saying is that

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:54.456 A:middle
typical methods of market

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:56.046 A:middle
identification probably would

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:59.756 A:middle
not have led Robert Plath to

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:00.936 A:middle
focus so narrowly.
