00:34:00.156 --> 00:34:01.456 A:middle
So I want to show you a couple

00:34:01.496 --> 00:34:04.266 A:middle
of last quick examples of apps

00:34:04.356 --> 00:34:06.616 A:middle
that rely on a familiar form to

00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:08.356 A:middle
make interactions feel useful.

00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:12.065 A:middle
So the core concept of an app

00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:13.666 A:middle
called Tinycards is to bring

00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:15.045 A:middle
flashcards on to a mobile

00:34:15.045 --> 00:34:15.636 A:middle
advice.

00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:17.416 A:middle
You can use them to memorize

00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:18.315 A:middle
pretty much anything --

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.916 A:middle
languages, flowers, leaves,

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:22.306 A:middle
almost anything.

00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:25.255 A:middle
So the interaction within the

00:34:25.255 --> 00:34:26.516 A:middle
app is super direct.

00:34:26.676 --> 00:34:28.226 A:middle
People expect cards to have

00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:29.916 A:middle
dimension, so that periodic

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:31.686 A:middle
pulse is inviting you to

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:32.866 A:middle
interact with the card.

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:35.156 A:middle
You flip the card over by

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:35.735 A:middle
tapping it.

00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:37.716 A:middle
So these cards have two sides.

00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:40.286 A:middle
They've respected the metaphor

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:41.005 A:middle
of the card.

00:34:42.116 --> 00:34:43.416 A:middle
People appreciate that.

00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:47.525 A:middle
So the entire experience of

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.516 A:middle
Tinycards is based on quickly

00:34:49.516 --> 00:34:51.076 A:middle
flicking through these cards as

00:34:51.076 --> 00:34:52.386 A:middle
you commit things to memory.

00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:54.775 A:middle
Like for instance the flags of

00:34:54.775 --> 00:34:55.906 A:middle
Canadian provinces.

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:56.926 A:middle
Does anyone know this one?
