00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:01.696 A:middle
So Alan built this with a small

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:03.986 A:middle
team and as he did it he began

00:18:03.986 --> 00:18:05.876 A:middle
to recognize a problem in

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.716 A:middle
maintaining a focus on what

00:18:07.716 --> 00:18:08.716 A:middle
people really want.

00:18:08.896 --> 00:18:10.596 A:middle
And he tells this great story in

00:18:11.016 --> 00:18:13.866 A:middle
a book about another invention

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:16.286 A:middle
and that story is a parable of

00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:20.026 A:middle
how powerful knowing people can

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:21.666 A:middle
be, knowing the person that

00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:22.696 A:middle
you're designing for.

00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:25.506 A:middle
So apologies if I got your hopes

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:26.596 A:middle
up about Visual Basic.

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:27.676 A:middle
I'm actually not going to talk

00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:28.246 A:middle
about that.

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:30.986 A:middle
I want to focus on this story

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:32.366 A:middle
and kind of extend it a little

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:32.686 A:middle
bit.

00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:35.226 A:middle
So the invention that he talks

00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:37.496 A:middle
about is the Rollaboard

00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:38.346 A:middle
Suitcase.

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.596 A:middle
So this is the patent form for

00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:41.356 A:middle
the Rollaboard.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.746 A:middle
So nowadays the suitcase might

00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.186 A:middle
seem pretty unremarkable.

00:18:47.236 --> 00:18:49.106 A:middle
For most of us this is just a

00:18:49.106 --> 00:18:51.016 A:middle
suitcase, big deal.

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:53.386 A:middle
But it actually hasn't been

00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:54.296 A:middle
around for that long.

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:56.676 A:middle
The patent was filed in 1989.

00:18:57.026 --> 00:18:58.086 A:middle
People have been traveling

00:18:58.276 --> 00:18:59.086 A:middle
forever though.

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:01.706 A:middle
So why did it take so long to
