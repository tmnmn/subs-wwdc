00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:00.056 A:middle
a literal recreation of this.

00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:02.086 A:middle
This is an early comp and they

00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:04.106 A:middle
also prototyped shuffling and

00:15:04.106 --> 00:15:08.276 A:middle
flipping cards to try to kind of

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:11.706 A:middle
replicate the origin of this

00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:12.556 A:middle
prison workout.

00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:14.466 A:middle
But they quickly moved past the

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:15.566 A:middle
literal approach.

00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:17.876 A:middle
They didn't stick to the literal

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.416 A:middle
deck of cards because it carried

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:20.666 A:middle
too many constraints.

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.606 A:middle
Four suits would limit the

00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:23.686 A:middle
number of movements that you

00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:25.026 A:middle
could do in each workout and

00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:26.266 A:middle
people would somehow need to

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:28.086 A:middle
remember that diamonds

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:29.546 A:middle
represented crunches in that

00:15:29.546 --> 00:15:31.386 A:middle
particular workout and that's

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:32.136 A:middle
work, right?

00:15:33.496 --> 00:15:35.056 A:middle
So instead they focused on the

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.626 A:middle
value that they wanted to bring.

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:39.586 A:middle
They wanted to help people make

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.066 A:middle
a habit of working out.

00:15:42.446 --> 00:15:44.616 A:middle
So they acknowledged that people

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:46.516 A:middle
felt inertia when they were

00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:47.846 A:middle
going to launch a workout app

00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:49.846 A:middle
and they removed as much as

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:51.466 A:middle
possible that might trigger that

00:15:52.146 --> 00:15:53.446 A:middle
and they stayed true to the

00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.366 A:middle
original intent of the prison

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:57.226 A:middle
workout, which is that spirit of

00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:58.816 A:middle
randomness and surprise.

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle
And that's what I mean by deep
