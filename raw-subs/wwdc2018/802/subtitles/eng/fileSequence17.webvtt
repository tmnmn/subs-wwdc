00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:01.856 A:middle
understanding and you feel a

00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:04.356 A:middle
real empathy for the person that

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.576 A:middle
you're designing for.

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:06.705 A:middle
Those can work.

00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:10.935 A:middle
But too often those artifacts of

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:12.836 A:middle
needs and goals and skills, they

00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:14.165 A:middle
just feel artificial.

00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:16.685 A:middle
They may not connect with

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:17.286 A:middle
everyone.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:19.816 A:middle
They feel complicated or distant

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:20.576 A:middle
or corny.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:24.036 A:middle
So for a moment I want to talk

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:26.586 A:middle
about how much easier it is to

00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:28.376 A:middle
make some something when you

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:30.226 A:middle
really care about the person

00:17:30.226 --> 00:17:31.266 A:middle
you're making it for.

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:34.286 A:middle
So I first heard about this

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.316 A:middle
story that I'm going to tell you

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:35.836 A:middle
in a book.

00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:38.146 A:middle
It's by a guy named Alan Cooper,

00:17:38.486 --> 00:17:40.296 A:middle
he's a software developer from

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:42.816 A:middle
the early days, and his claim to

00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:44.686 A:middle
fame is that he created a

00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:47.276 A:middle
prototype that became Visual

00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:47.786 A:middle
Basic.

00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:50.776 A:middle
And this is an actual pixel

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:53.646 A:middle
resolution of Visual Basic 1.0

00:17:54.576 --> 00:17:55.816 A:middle
on a 4K display.

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:57.676 A:middle
It's pretty amazing.

00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:01.696 A:middle
So Alan built this with a small
