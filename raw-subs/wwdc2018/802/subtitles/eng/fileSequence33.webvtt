00:32:57.046 --> 00:33:01.036 A:middle
meditation practice, imagine the

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:02.666 A:middle
impression that it would leave

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:04.686 A:middle
on people if not only the tab

00:33:04.686 --> 00:33:06.456 A:middle
bar was more direct, but the

00:33:06.456 --> 00:33:07.976 A:middle
directness of the tab bar

00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:10.256 A:middle
enforced a simplicity and an

00:33:10.326 --> 00:33:12.296 A:middle
order on the content that you

00:33:12.296 --> 00:33:12.926 A:middle
display.

00:33:13.006 --> 00:33:15.576 A:middle
And that content was predictable

00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:17.356 A:middle
and directly organized.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:20.236 A:middle
So indirect labels feel

00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:22.246 A:middle
conventional and they feel safe

00:33:22.356 --> 00:33:23.726 A:middle
but they mask utility.

00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:25.786 A:middle
Like a storage locker you're

00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:27.066 A:middle
putting your valuable stuff

00:33:27.196 --> 00:33:29.066 A:middle
behind a door that's anonymous

00:33:29.096 --> 00:33:29.946 A:middle
and inscrutable.

00:33:30.246 --> 00:33:32.176 A:middle
And this is what I mean by

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.396 A:middle
unintentional design.

00:33:34.666 --> 00:33:36.436 A:middle
No one intends to be indirect.

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.516 A:middle
Being intentional will lead to

00:33:40.556 --> 00:33:41.886 A:middle
cleaner and clearer

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:42.706 A:middle
communication.

00:33:42.706 --> 00:33:44.846 A:middle
And this brings me to my final

00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:45.936 A:middle
element of intent.

00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:47.976 A:middle
Direct communication.

00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:49.806 A:middle
Intentionally design things.

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.366 A:middle
Clearly communicate to the

00:33:51.366 --> 00:33:52.466 A:middle
people who use them.

00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:55.766 A:middle
And the way to achieve this is

00:33:55.766 --> 00:33:57.486 A:middle
to draw on what people learn on

00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:59.606 A:middle
the platform and in the world.
