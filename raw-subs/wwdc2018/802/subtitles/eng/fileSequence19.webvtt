00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:01.706 A:middle
So why did it take so long to

00:19:01.706 --> 00:19:03.806 A:middle
design something so obvious?

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:06.556 A:middle
The inventor was a guy named

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:07.276 A:middle
Robert Plath.

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:09.496 A:middle
I'm guessing not a household

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.486 A:middle
name, but more on that in a

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:11.746 A:middle
minute.

00:19:13.136 --> 00:19:15.126 A:middle
So what was innovative about

00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:15.536 A:middle
this?

00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:17.556 A:middle
Well, I think the innovations

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.176 A:middle
are subtle.

00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:19.666 A:middle
It wasn't the wheels.

00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:22.476 A:middle
Many patents had been filed for

00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:24.146 A:middle
wheeled suitcases before.

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:25.396 A:middle
This is from the '70s.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:28.416 A:middle
So the wheels are underneath and

00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:29.966 A:middle
it's also got some kind of leash

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:30.406 A:middle
thing.

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:35.166 A:middle
Suitcase manufactures had been

00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:36.826 A:middle
trying to put wheels on

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:38.586 A:middle
suitcases as far back as the

00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:41.006 A:middle
'40s and this actually has some

00:19:41.006 --> 00:19:43.476 A:middle
kind of other leash thing, some

00:19:43.476 --> 00:19:45.706 A:middle
grabber thing that you can see

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:46.356 A:middle
right there.

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:49.716 A:middle
So clearly people have been

00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:51.306 A:middle
trying to figure out a way to

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:53.466 A:middle
not carry heavy things.

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:56.176 A:middle
So if you worked in the luggage

00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:59.176 A:middle
industry in 1989, you probably

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
thought you'd already innovated.
