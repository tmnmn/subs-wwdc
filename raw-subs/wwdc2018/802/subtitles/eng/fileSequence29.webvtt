00:28:57.646 --> 00:29:00.006 A:middle
audience to break out of this

00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:03.446 A:middle
pattern, right, and turn the

00:29:03.446 --> 00:29:04.726 A:middle
form on it's head [laughing].

00:29:06.636 --> 00:29:06.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:29:07.516 --> 00:29:09.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:10.046 --> 00:29:12.136 A:middle
So we apply patterns

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:12.906 A:middle
automatically.

00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.486 A:middle
Our brains make connections

00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:17.306 A:middle
quickly and that has benefits,

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:17.506 A:middle
right?

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:18.996 A:middle
It helps us work efficiently.

00:29:19.606 --> 00:29:21.956 A:middle
It helps us be consistent, but

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:23.206 A:middle
it also prevents us from

00:29:23.206 --> 00:29:25.506 A:middle
noticing the obvious and

00:29:25.506 --> 00:29:27.766 A:middle
challenging it, asking

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.106 A:middle
fundamental questions, why does

00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:31.026 A:middle
this thing need to be this way?

00:29:31.426 --> 00:29:33.786 A:middle
So as a UI designer it's really

00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:36.356 A:middle
tempting always to draw on

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:38.336 A:middle
familiar UI elements to solve

00:29:38.336 --> 00:29:39.216 A:middle
new problems.

00:29:39.826 --> 00:29:41.786 A:middle
I'm sure you're familiar with

00:29:41.786 --> 00:29:42.906 A:middle
the house icon.

00:29:43.306 --> 00:29:44.926 A:middle
It made sense in a desktop

00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:45.476 A:middle
browser.

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:48.766 A:middle
A browser is a frame for the

00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:50.026 A:middle
Internet universe.

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:52.956 A:middle
A browser home button will lift

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:55.456 A:middle
you out of whatever corner of

00:29:55.456 --> 00:29:57.776 A:middle
the dark web that you found

00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.036 A:middle
yourself in and allows you to
