00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.506 A:middle
And to be clear the goal of

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.336 A:middle
iTranslate Converse is to make

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.516 A:middle
conversation easy.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:05.596 A:middle
The developers have intended

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.966 A:middle
this app to be used together.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:09.586 A:middle
So two people together, one of

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.926 A:middle
whom most likely has never used

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.686 A:middle
this app before, probably never

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.676 A:middle
even seen it.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.736 A:middle
So I launched this app really

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.696 A:middle
for real in in the Naples train

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.106 A:middle
station when I was trying to get

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.276 A:middle
on an express train to Rome and

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:26.216 A:middle
the platforms were really

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:26.996 A:middle
confusing.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:29.226 A:middle
So I pulled out my phone, I

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:30.546 A:middle
launched the app, and I walked

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:31.926 A:middle
up to a conductor.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:34.816 A:middle
So I said is this the express

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:35.776 A:middle
train to Rome?

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.926 A:middle
[Computerized Speaking Italian]

00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:42.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The app translated it into

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.996 A:middle
Italian and the conductor heard.

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.956 A:middle
Then I could flip the phone

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.786 A:middle
around and again, what I find

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:53.136 A:middle
interesting in this situation

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:55.236 A:middle
that other person has probably

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:56.586 A:middle
never seen this app before.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
And they speak in a language
