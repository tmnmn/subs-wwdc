00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle
And that's what I mean by deep

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.376 A:middle
understanding.

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:03.806 A:middle
Knowing the person that you want

00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:05.476 A:middle
to reach and the actual problem

00:16:05.476 --> 00:16:06.436 A:middle
that they might have.

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:08.476 A:middle
So the superficial approach to

00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:10.076 A:middle
this workout would have been

00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:11.286 A:middle
just a typical workout app,

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:11.646 A:middle
right?

00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:13.036 A:middle
Of course people want to get

00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:13.516 A:middle
healthy.

00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:15.756 A:middle
But what people really want, or

00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:17.326 A:middle
what I really want anyway is to

00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:19.286 A:middle
get past the boredom and that

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:20.626 A:middle
inertia and they've addressed

00:16:20.656 --> 00:16:21.306 A:middle
that for me.

00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:27.306 A:middle
So knowing users is nothing new.

00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:30.386 A:middle
I'm guessing a lot of you here

00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:32.726 A:middle
have personas and market

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:35.106 A:middle
segments and you do surveys and

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.796 A:middle
other kinds of user research

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.336 A:middle
focus groups.

00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:40.326 A:middle
Maybe you create experience maps

00:16:40.326 --> 00:16:41.846 A:middle
and customer journeys and user

00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:42.536 A:middle
stories.

00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.086 A:middle
All of those can be useful

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:45.616 A:middle
models.

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.266 A:middle
But they have to feel authentic,

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:48.776 A:middle
right?

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
They actually have to feel like

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:51.366 A:middle
people.

00:16:52.776 --> 00:16:54.776 A:middle
That can make focus easier and

00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:56.316 A:middle
it can help teams kind of come

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:57.966 A:middle
together around a vision.

00:16:57.966 --> 00:16:59.676 A:middle
As long as you share a common

00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:01.856 A:middle
understanding and you feel a
