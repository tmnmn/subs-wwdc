00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:01.966 A:middle
So I'm no suggesting that it's a

00:38:01.966 --> 00:38:04.116 A:middle
replacement for rosary beads or

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:05.546 A:middle
any prayer beads because the

00:38:05.546 --> 00:38:07.496 A:middle
physical beads can have deep,

00:38:07.716 --> 00:38:09.056 A:middle
you know, personal meaning.

00:38:09.576 --> 00:38:11.066 A:middle
But I love how they've

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:13.066 A:middle
thoughtfully carried that real

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.786 A:middle
world experience into a digital

00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:16.626 A:middle
form in a way that's so

00:38:16.626 --> 00:38:18.476 A:middle
radically simple and clear.

00:38:19.486 --> 00:38:20.666 A:middle
And I think it really

00:38:21.556 --> 00:38:23.516 A:middle
illustrates each of the points

00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:24.646 A:middle
that I made earlier -- the

00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:26.326 A:middle
simplicity and the understanding

00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:28.946 A:middle
of people, the extreme kind of

00:38:28.946 --> 00:38:31.256 A:middle
focus on a problem and the

00:38:31.256 --> 00:38:32.906 A:middle
direct communication of a

00:38:32.906 --> 00:38:33.626 A:middle
solution.

00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:36.736 A:middle
And this is intent in action.

00:38:36.736 --> 00:38:38.226 A:middle
This is being intentional in

00:38:38.226 --> 00:38:38.756 A:middle
design.

00:38:38.756 --> 00:38:41.036 A:middle
It's a matter of turning off the

00:38:41.036 --> 00:38:43.956 A:middle
automatic part of your brain, of

00:38:43.956 --> 00:38:46.176 A:middle
slowing down, and challenging

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:46.956 A:middle
the obvious.

00:38:48.506 --> 00:38:51.216 A:middle
It requires a level of intention

00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:53.326 A:middle
that will enable your decisions

00:38:53.326 --> 00:38:55.266 A:middle
to become more conscious and for

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.186 A:middle
you to become aware of the

00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.876 A:middle
patterns and the familiar things

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:00.016 A:middle
that might get in the way and
