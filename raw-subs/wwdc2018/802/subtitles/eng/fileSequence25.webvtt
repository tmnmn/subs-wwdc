00:24:59.866 --> 00:25:01.456 A:middle
people really close to him --

00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:03.696 A:middle
his wife, his sister, and his

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:04.136 A:middle
mom.

00:25:04.496 --> 00:25:08.126 A:middle
And these forecasts are a form

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:11.706 A:middle
of conversation with them.

00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:14.306 A:middle
So the lesson is that the people

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:15.756 A:middle
that Brian is trying to reach,

00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:17.976 A:middle
the people that he's speaking to

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:19.486 A:middle
with these forecasts are

00:25:19.486 --> 00:25:20.756 A:middle
actually really specific.

00:25:20.756 --> 00:25:23.196 A:middle
And I think that's what makes

00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.366 A:middle
his apps stand out.

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:26.246 A:middle
The edginess helps him connect

00:25:26.246 --> 00:25:26.856 A:middle
with people.

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:28.566 A:middle
And it's not surprising to me

00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:30.246 A:middle
that he's had so much success in

00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:30.976 A:middle
the app store.

00:25:32.096 --> 00:25:33.486 A:middle
The personal touch is what

00:25:33.486 --> 00:25:35.666 A:middle
allows his app to deeply connect

00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:38.926 A:middle
with the rest of us.

00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:42.706 A:middle
Obviously personality isn't the

00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:45.056 A:middle
sole province of weather apps.

00:25:45.346 --> 00:25:47.596 A:middle
All apps can deliver something

00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:48.096 A:middle
like this.

00:25:48.096 --> 00:25:50.326 A:middle
All apps can feel handcrafted

00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:51.096 A:middle
and special.

00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:53.096 A:middle
And that's the fourth element of

00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:54.256 A:middle
intent that I want to talk

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:54.476 A:middle
about.

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:56.776 A:middle
Intentionally designed apps feel

00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:57.636 A:middle
personal.

00:25:58.096 --> 00:25:59.316 A:middle
They create a personal

00:25:59.316 --> 00:25:59.866 A:middle
connection.
