00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:00.886 A:middle
Make it more coherent.

00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
Make it simpler.

00:23:02.216 --> 00:23:03.616 A:middle
And therefore actually reach

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:04.506 A:middle
more people.

00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:09.796 A:middle
So let's relate extreme to our

00:23:10.186 --> 00:23:10.406 A:middle
work.

00:23:10.406 --> 00:23:12.226 A:middle
Is there a way to relate extreme

00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.266 A:middle
to the work that we do?

00:23:13.966 --> 00:23:15.646 A:middle
I think there is and I think

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.196 A:middle
being extreme can be really

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:19.576 A:middle
worthwhile but you have to nail

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:19.706 A:middle
it.

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:22.846 A:middle
So you might not immediately

00:23:22.846 --> 00:23:25.696 A:middle
associate the words extreme and

00:23:26.086 --> 00:23:26.856 A:middle
weather app.

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:29.766 A:middle
But Carrot Weather is a really

00:23:29.766 --> 00:23:32.686 A:middle
compelling illustration of being

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:33.456 A:middle
extreme.

00:23:34.476 --> 00:23:36.396 A:middle
So on the surface it's a weather

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:36.646 A:middle
app.

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:37.926 A:middle
So let's check the weather

00:23:37.926 --> 00:23:38.646 A:middle
forecast.

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:42.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I wonder how many licks it

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.626 A:middle
takes to get to the center of a

00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.446 A:middle
human skull.

00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:48.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So right, they're not typical

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:49.326 A:middle
forecasts.

00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.086 A:middle
The voice of Carrot, which is

00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:52.476 A:middle
the robotic voice that you

00:23:52.476 --> 00:23:54.676 A:middle
heard, has personality and

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:57.136 A:middle
attitude and a little bit of an

00:23:58.116 --> 00:23:58.196 A:middle
edge.

00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:00.606 A:middle
You probably think this sunshine
