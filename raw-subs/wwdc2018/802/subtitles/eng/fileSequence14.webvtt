00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:00.536 A:middle
it because it's unique and it's

00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:01.716 A:middle
implemented really well.

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:03.786 A:middle
So I asked the developers of

00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
Streaks Workout.

00:14:06.256 --> 00:14:09.436 A:middle
And it's such a common story to

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
hear about how an app originated

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:14.066 A:middle
with an idea that came out of

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:14.686 A:middle
prison.

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:19.406 A:middle
So specifically, their idea

00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:21.196 A:middle
originated with how inmates in

00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:22.946 A:middle
prison keep workouts new and

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:23.596 A:middle
interesting.

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:25.526 A:middle
So I want to walk you through

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.436 A:middle
how that works.

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:30.616 A:middle
So in prison you take a normal

00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:31.786 A:middle
deck of cards and at the

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:33.656 A:middle
beginning of each workout you

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.136 A:middle
would assign a movement to each

00:14:35.136 --> 00:14:35.626 A:middle
suit.

00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:38.106 A:middle
So today diamonds are crunches.

00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:40.346 A:middle
The numbers on the cards

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:42.356 A:middle
represent the number of reps per

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:42.856 A:middle
movement.

00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:44.416 A:middle
So at the beginning of the

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.456 A:middle
workout you'd put the deck face

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:49.106 A:middle
down and you'd start drawing and

00:14:49.106 --> 00:14:50.206 A:middle
each card would deliver a

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:51.566 A:middle
movement and a rep count.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:53.606 A:middle
OK, everyone eight crunches.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.096 A:middle
So the original app concept was

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:00.056 A:middle
a literal recreation of this.
