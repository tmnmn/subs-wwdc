00:31:56.616 --> 00:32:00.866 A:middle
"Predecessor is the index before

00:32:00.866 --> 00:32:02.416 A:middle
the first one where the

00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:04.286 A:middle
predicate is satisfied.

00:32:05.346 --> 00:32:06.656 A:middle
Now, just look how pretty that

00:32:06.656 --> 00:32:07.046 A:middle
reads."

00:32:08.486 --> 00:32:10.946 A:middle
Now, if you look at it, you can

00:32:10.946 --> 00:32:11.706 A:middle
see that he's right.

00:32:13.116 --> 00:32:15.006 A:middle
Taking away all the irrelevant

00:32:15.006 --> 00:32:17.436 A:middle
detail about shapes, selections,

00:32:17.546 --> 00:32:20.066 A:middle
arrays, and integers had left me

00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:22.006 A:middle
with clearer code because it

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:23.626 A:middle
only traffics in the essentials

00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:24.356 A:middle
of the problem.

00:32:24.926 --> 00:32:27.496 A:middle
"I already showed you how

00:32:27.496 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
indexBeforeFirst works.

00:32:29.266 --> 00:32:31.986 A:middle
See if you could write it," he

00:32:31.986 --> 00:32:32.236 A:middle
said.

00:32:32.706 --> 00:32:34.036 A:middle
So, I think I was starting to

00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:36.016 A:middle
catch on now because I got it

00:32:36.016 --> 00:32:37.036 A:middle
right the first time.

00:32:37.666 --> 00:32:40.646 A:middle
I told you, I'm a superfast

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:40.996 A:middle
typist.

00:32:41.466 --> 00:32:41.726 A:middle
All right.

00:32:42.236 --> 00:32:45.436 A:middle
So, return the first index whose

00:32:45.436 --> 00:32:48.536 A:middle
successor matches the predicate.

00:32:49.206 --> 00:32:51.556 A:middle
I was pretty excited about how

00:32:51.556 --> 00:32:52.396 A:middle
well this was going.

00:32:53.436 --> 00:32:54.456 A:middle
"All right, Crusty," I said,

00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:55.726 A:middle
"let's do the next one."

00:32:57.516 --> 00:32:58.946 A:middle
"Ain't you forgetting something,

00:32:58.946 --> 00:32:59.296 A:middle
Bonkey?"
