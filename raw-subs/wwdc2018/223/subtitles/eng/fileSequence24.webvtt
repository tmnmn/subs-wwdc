00:23:57.876 --> 00:24:00.156 A:middle
But Crusty didn't like that way

00:24:00.156 --> 00:24:01.506 A:middle
of thinking about it at all.

00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:03.396 A:middle
"That little do-si-do at the

00:24:03.396 --> 00:24:05.026 A:middle
beginning is making a line dance

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:06.096 A:middle
look like a Fox Trot."

00:24:06.356 --> 00:24:08.466 A:middle
he said, "You don't need it."

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:10.906 A:middle
When I looked at him blankly, he

00:24:10.906 --> 00:24:12.206 A:middle
broke out the lozenges again,

00:24:13.976 --> 00:24:15.616 A:middle
and with five of his free

00:24:15.616 --> 00:24:17.836 A:middle
digits, he executed the

00:24:17.836 --> 00:24:19.926 A:middle
bringForward command.

00:24:22.556 --> 00:24:23.506 A:middle
"See it again?"

00:24:23.776 --> 00:24:24.226 A:middle
he asked.

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:26.816 A:middle
I felt a little like a mark in a

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:29.666 A:middle
Three-card Monte, but I played

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:33.976 A:middle
along.

00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:35.176 A:middle
"Look familiar?"

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:36.616 A:middle
"No."

00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:39.296 A:middle
He threw a hanky over the first

00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:40.006 A:middle
few.

00:24:42.296 --> 00:24:46.366 A:middle
"How about now?"

00:24:46.636 --> 00:24:48.876 A:middle
That's when I realized it was

00:24:48.876 --> 00:24:50.226 A:middle
just another stable partition.

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:51.766 A:middle
Okay.

00:24:52.236 --> 00:24:54.046 A:middle
I got this, I thought.

00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:58.096 A:middle
If we find the front most

00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
selected shape, then move to its
