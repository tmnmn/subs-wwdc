00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:01.316 A:middle
even be contiguous in the list.

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:06.486 A:middle
So, it turns out that the

00:19:06.486 --> 00:19:07.906 A:middle
behavior that makes sense is to

00:19:07.906 --> 00:19:09.166 A:middle
leave all of the selected

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:10.826 A:middle
elements next to each other

00:19:10.826 --> 00:19:12.126 A:middle
after the operation is finished.

00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:14.176 A:middle
So, when you're bringing shapes

00:19:14.176 --> 00:19:15.596 A:middle
forward, you hop the front most

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:17.136 A:middle
selected shape in front of its

00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:18.936 A:middle
neighbor, and then you group all

00:19:18.936 --> 00:19:20.566 A:middle
the other ones behind it.

00:19:22.386 --> 00:19:23.736 A:middle
And when you send shapes

00:19:23.776 --> 00:19:25.496 A:middle
backward, you hop the bottom

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:26.926 A:middle
most selected shape backward

00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:28.396 A:middle
behind its neighbor and group

00:19:28.396 --> 00:19:30.366 A:middle
the other ones in front of it.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:36.256 A:middle
So, if you didn't follow that

00:19:36.256 --> 00:19:37.626 A:middle
completely, don't worry.

00:19:37.626 --> 00:19:38.526 A:middle
We'll come back to it.

00:19:38.856 --> 00:19:41.386 A:middle
But suffice it to say that I had

00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:42.836 A:middle
some pretty carefully worked out

00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:44.356 A:middle
code to get all of these details

00:19:44.356 --> 00:19:44.606 A:middle
right.

00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:47.996 A:middle
For example, this was

00:19:47.996 --> 00:19:51.256 A:middle
bringToFront, and when I looked

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:53.656 A:middle
at it, sure enough, there was an

00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:55.366 A:middle
order n loop over the shapes

00:19:55.956 --> 00:19:57.716 A:middle
containing two order n

00:19:57.716 --> 00:20:00.186 A:middle
operations, remove(at:) and
