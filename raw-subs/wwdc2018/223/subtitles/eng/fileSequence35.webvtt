00:34:59.526 --> 00:35:01.416 A:middle
because it's a really beautiful

00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:02.486 A:middle
and instructive algorithm.

00:35:03.766 --> 00:35:05.196 A:middle
The public method gets the

00:35:05.196 --> 00:35:06.846 A:middle
collections count and passes it

00:35:06.846 --> 00:35:10.506 A:middle
on to this helper, which uses a

00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:11.776 A:middle
divide and conquer strategy.

00:35:13.056 --> 00:35:15.136 A:middle
So, first, it takes care of the

00:35:15.136 --> 00:35:17.276 A:middle
base cases when the count is

00:35:17.276 --> 00:35:18.436 A:middle
less than 2, we're done.

00:35:18.966 --> 00:35:19.916 A:middle
We just need to figure out

00:35:20.396 --> 00:35:21.656 A:middle
whether the partition point is

00:35:21.656 --> 00:35:23.046 A:middle
at the beginning or at the end

00:35:23.046 --> 00:35:26.016 A:middle
of the collection.

00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:28.496 A:middle
Next, we divide the collection

00:35:28.546 --> 00:35:29.416 A:middle
in two.

00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:33.696 A:middle
Now, at this point, you have to

00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:35.136 A:middle
temporarily take it on faith

00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:37.146 A:middle
that the algorithm works because

00:35:37.146 --> 00:35:38.346 A:middle
we're going to stable partition

00:35:38.346 --> 00:35:41.056 A:middle
the left half and the right

00:35:41.056 --> 00:35:41.446 A:middle
half.

00:35:42.136 --> 00:35:46.766 A:middle
Now, if you take a look at these

00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:49.166 A:middle
two ends, you can see that

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.746 A:middle
everything is exactly in the

00:35:50.746 --> 00:35:54.556 A:middle
right place, but this center

00:35:54.556 --> 00:35:56.516 A:middle
section has two parts that need

00:35:56.516 --> 00:35:57.316 A:middle
to be exchanged.

00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:01.016 A:middle
Now, they won't always have the
