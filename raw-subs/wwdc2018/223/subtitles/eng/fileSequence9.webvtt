00:08:58.226 --> 00:09:00.176 A:middle
You say you don't do object

00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
oriented.

00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:02.646 A:middle
Well, I don't 'do' algorithms."

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.406 A:middle
You pay attention to your data

00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:06.066 A:middle
structures in algorithms class

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:08.036 A:middle
because you know when it's time

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:09.806 A:middle
to get a job, your interviewer

00:09:09.806 --> 00:09:10.946 A:middle
is going to ask you about them.

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:12.776 A:middle
But in the real programming

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:14.766 A:middle
world, what separates the elite

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:16.946 A:middle
from the newbies is the ability

00:09:16.946 --> 00:09:18.396 A:middle
to wire together controllers,

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:19.766 A:middle
delegates, and responders to

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:22.546 A:middle
build a working system.

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.906 A:middle
"Bonkey," he said; I don't know

00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:27.276 A:middle
why he calls me that, "What do

00:09:27.506 --> 00:09:28.656 A:middle
computers do?"

00:09:30.096 --> 00:09:30.816 A:middle
"They compute."

00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:33.086 A:middle
"Now, where's the computation in

00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:34.286 A:middle
all that?"

00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:37.966 A:middle
"Well," I replied, "I guess I

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:39.106 A:middle
don't see anything that looks

00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:40.496 A:middle
like an algorithm in my code."

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:43.296 A:middle
But Crusty wasn't having it.

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:45.106 A:middle
"Oh, your app is full of them,"

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:46.646 A:middle
he said, dropping an old dead

00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:47.956 A:middle
tree dictionary on my desk,

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:50.496 A:middle
"Look it up."

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:54.066 A:middle
After I gathered my composure, I

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.396 A:middle
carefully slid the book to one

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.226 A:middle
side and typed Define Algorithm

00:09:57.226 --> 00:09:58.886 A:middle
into Spotlight, which Crusty

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:00.000 A:middle
thought was a neat trick.
