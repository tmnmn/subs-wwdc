00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:00.766 A:middle
the Quick Help for stable

00:23:00.806 --> 00:23:04.196 A:middle
partition, and I saw that it had

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.046 A:middle
(n log n) complexity.

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:09.356 A:middle
So, for a way to think about (n

00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:11.506 A:middle
log n) take a look at log n.

00:23:12.096 --> 00:23:15.236 A:middle
It starts to level off really

00:23:15.236 --> 00:23:17.246 A:middle
quickly, and the bigger it gets,

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.856 A:middle
the slower it grows, and the

00:23:19.886 --> 00:23:21.246 A:middle
closer it comes to being a

00:23:21.246 --> 00:23:21.716 A:middle
constant.

00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.136 A:middle
So, when you multiply that by n,

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:27.366 A:middle
you get something that doesn't

00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:29.376 A:middle
scale quite as well as order n

00:23:29.876 --> 00:23:31.466 A:middle
but that gets closer and closer

00:23:31.466 --> 00:23:32.946 A:middle
to linear as it grows.

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:36.696 A:middle
So, order n login is rightly

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:38.556 A:middle
often treated as being almost

00:23:38.556 --> 00:23:40.066 A:middle
the same as order n.

00:23:40.896 --> 00:23:42.296 A:middle
I was pretty happy with that.

00:23:43.056 --> 00:23:44.326 A:middle
So, we moved on to bring

00:23:44.326 --> 00:23:44.696 A:middle
forward.

00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:49.646 A:middle
Now, as we said earlier, bring

00:23:49.726 --> 00:23:51.626 A:middle
forward bumps the front most

00:23:51.626 --> 00:23:53.006 A:middle
selected shape forward by one

00:23:53.006 --> 00:23:55.296 A:middle
position and gathers the other

00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:56.576 A:middle
selected shapes behind it.

00:23:57.876 --> 00:24:00.156 A:middle
But Crusty didn't like that way
