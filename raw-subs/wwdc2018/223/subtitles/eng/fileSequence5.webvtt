00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:06.266 A:middle
But if you go backwards, you

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:07.526 A:middle
only iterate over the parts of

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:08.376 A:middle
the array that you haven't

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:08.896 A:middle
changed yet.

00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:10.776 A:middle
Slick, right?

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:12.556 A:middle
And this is the pattern I've

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:14.916 A:middle
used ever since because it's

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:19.476 A:middle
clean, and it never fails, until

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.736 A:middle
a few months ago.

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:24.056 A:middle
One morning, I had just finished

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:26.216 A:middle
my avocado toast, and I was idly

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:28.376 A:middle
fooling with my app when I tried

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:29.986 A:middle
deleting about half the shapes

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.216 A:middle
from a really complicated

00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:31.686 A:middle
canvas.

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:35.166 A:middle
My iPad, it froze up for like

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:36.206 A:middle
three seconds.

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:40.586 A:middle
So, I took a sip of my half caf

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:42.746 A:middle
triple shot latte in its bamboo

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.716 A:middle
thermal commuter cup, and I

00:05:44.716 --> 00:05:45.936 A:middle
considered my options.

00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:48.526 A:middle
This was disturbing.

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:50.006 A:middle
I mean, it's a pretty

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:51.716 A:middle
straightforward operation, and

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:53.686 A:middle
my code was so clean, how could

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.286 A:middle
it be wrong?

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:58.256 A:middle
Profiling showed me that the hot

00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:01.156 A:middle
spot was right here, but beyond
