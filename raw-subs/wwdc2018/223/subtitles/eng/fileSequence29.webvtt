00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.046 A:middle
whether a given shape should be

00:29:00.046 --> 00:29:00.866 A:middle
brought forward.

00:29:04.716 --> 00:29:06.156 A:middle
And everything kept compiling.

00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:07.386 A:middle
Awesome!

00:29:08.266 --> 00:29:10.826 A:middle
At that point, I was pleased to

00:29:10.826 --> 00:29:12.086 A:middle
find there were no dependencies

00:29:12.086 --> 00:29:14.266 A:middle
left on shape, and I could just

00:29:14.426 --> 00:29:15.406 A:middle
delete the where clause.

00:29:15.956 --> 00:29:18.106 A:middle
Pretty cool, I thought.

00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:20.106 A:middle
Now, I can bring forward on any

00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:20.506 A:middle
array.

00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:23.386 A:middle
I looked over at Crusty, who had

00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:24.636 A:middle
been quietly practicing the

00:29:24.676 --> 00:29:26.876 A:middle
cha-cha-cha in the corner, but

00:29:26.876 --> 00:29:28.586 A:middle
he didn't seem to think I was

00:29:29.736 --> 00:29:30.000 A:middle
finished.

00:29:31.316 --> 00:29:32.996 A:middle
"What does bring forward have to

00:29:32.996 --> 00:29:34.026 A:middle
do with arrays?"

00:29:34.916 --> 00:29:37.196 A:middle
he asked.

00:29:37.436 --> 00:29:38.976 A:middle
"Well, nothing," I sighed and

00:29:38.976 --> 00:29:40.046 A:middle
started thinking about how to

00:29:40.046 --> 00:29:41.206 A:middle
remove this dependency.

00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:43.706 A:middle
Let's see, there's a stable

00:29:43.706 --> 00:29:46.066 A:middle
partition here, which requires

00:29:46.066 --> 00:29:47.636 A:middle
mutable collection conformance.

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:49.416 A:middle
So, maybe I'll just move it to

00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:52.676 A:middle
mutable collection.

00:29:53.006 --> 00:29:53.466 A:middle
Hmm.

00:29:53.896 --> 00:29:56.076 A:middle
I thought, clearly the index

00:29:56.116 --> 00:29:58.536 A:middle
type doesn't match Int.

00:29:59.456 --> 00:29:59.746 A:middle
Okay.

00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:00.826 A:middle
So, there's a simple fix for
