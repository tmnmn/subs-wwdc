&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:26.136 A:middle
It's great to see you all here

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:26.446 A:middle
today.

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:29.676 A:middle
I'm Dave, and the next 40

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.436 A:middle
minutes are about understanding

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:33.996 A:middle
and honoring what makes our

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.716 A:middle
programs actually work.

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.286 A:middle
There will be practical advice,

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:40.986 A:middle

tips and techniques or any

00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:44.876 A:middle
specific algorithms even, though

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:45.816 A:middle
we will look at a few.

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.156 A:middle
It's about revealing something

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:50.956 A:middle
fundamental, the potential of

00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:53.076 A:middle
which is already present in your

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:54.006 A:middle
code.

00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:57.216 A:middle
I hope that for at least a few

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:58.796 A:middle
of you it marks the beginning of

00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:00.056 A:middle
a new relationship to the
