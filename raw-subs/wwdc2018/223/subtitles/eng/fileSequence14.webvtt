00:13:58.186 --> 00:14:00.196 A:middle
that comes, that indicates that

00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:02.116 A:middle
it preserves the order of the

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:03.646 A:middle
elements that it doesn't move,

00:14:04.486 --> 00:14:06.396 A:middle
but it can scramble the elements

00:14:06.436 --> 00:14:09.026 A:middle
that it moves to the end.

00:14:09.206 --> 00:14:10.426 A:middle
Now, sometimes, that doesn't

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:11.786 A:middle
matter though; the second

00:14:11.786 --> 00:14:13.166 A:middle
algorithm removes subrange.

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:14.146 A:middle
It's just going to delete them

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:14.456 A:middle
anyway.

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:17.956 A:middle
Have we all seen this partial

00:14:17.956 --> 00:14:18.696 A:middle
range notation?

00:14:19.256 --> 00:14:21.426 A:middle
It's just a really convenient

00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:22.656 A:middle
way of writing a range that

00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:23.696 A:middle
extends to the end of the

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.000 A:middle
collection.

00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:27.116 A:middle
Okay.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.986 A:middle
Now, remove subrange is part of

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:31.826 A:middle
the library's public API, so you

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:33.496 A:middle
can find its documentation

00:14:33.496 --> 00:14:36.276 A:middle
online, but halfStablePartition

00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:37.696 A:middle
is an implementation detail.

00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:42.166 A:middle
Now, we're not going to step

00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:43.556 A:middle
through all of it, but there are

00:14:43.556 --> 00:14:44.906 A:middle
a few things worth noticing

00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:45.116 A:middle
here.

00:14:46.516 --> 00:14:48.846 A:middle
First, it starts by calling yet

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:49.696 A:middle
another algorithm,

00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:52.596 A:middle
firstIndex(where), to find the

00:14:52.856 --> 00:14:54.716 A:middle
position of the first element

00:14:54.716 --> 00:14:55.796 A:middle
that belongs in the suffix.

00:14:57.176 --> 00:14:58.766 A:middle
Next, it sets up a loop variable

00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:01.126 A:middle
j, and there's a single loop,
