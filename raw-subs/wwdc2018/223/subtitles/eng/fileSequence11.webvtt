00:10:57.046 --> 00:11:00.676 A:middle
Now, shapes.removeallwhere the

00:11:00.676 --> 00:11:02.186 A:middle
shape is selected.

00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:03.326 A:middle
Hmm.

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:05.236 A:middle
Try that on for size."

00:11:06.216 --> 00:11:07.756 A:middle
Now, Crusty headed off to wash

00:11:07.756 --> 00:11:08.856 A:middle
out the pitcher of his coffee

00:11:08.856 --> 00:11:11.066 A:middle
maker, leaving me to figure out

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:12.816 A:middle
what had just happened in my

00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:13.766 A:middle
code.

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:17.756 A:middle
First, I checked, and I found

00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:18.936 A:middle
that the performance problem was

00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:19.286 A:middle
fixed.

00:11:19.856 --> 00:11:20.226 A:middle
Nice.

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:22.886 A:middle
And I didn't want another earful

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:24.226 A:middle
from Crusty about looking at the

00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:26.626 A:middle
documentation, so I popped up

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:28.126 A:middle
Quick Help for removeAll(where:

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:32.856 A:middle
and I saw that its complexity

00:11:32.856 --> 00:11:34.266 A:middle
scales proportionally to the

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:36.176 A:middle
length of the collection just

00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:36.806 A:middle
like removeAt.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.656 A:middle
But since I didn't have to put

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:41.576 A:middle
it in a loop, that became the

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.836 A:middle
complexity of my whole

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:43.376 A:middle
operation.

00:11:44.576 --> 00:11:46.776 A:middle
Now, I want to give you some

00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:48.026 A:middle
intuition for the kind of

00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:50.106 A:middle
difference this makes.

00:11:50.566 --> 00:11:52.476 A:middle
What are n means that the time

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:54.216 A:middle
the algorithm runs scales

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:56.166 A:middle
linearly with the problem size.

00:11:56.696 --> 00:11:57.936 A:middle
The graph is a straight line.

00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:00.826 A:middle
Now, the orange line is the
