00:26:58.636 --> 00:27:00.006 A:middle
"Can you run bring forward on a

00:27:00.006 --> 00:27:00.926 A:middle
row of lozenges?

00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:03.106 A:middle
Of course, you can.

00:27:04.086 --> 00:27:05.516 A:middle
So, it's got nothing to do with

00:27:06.206 --> 00:27:06.500 A:middle
shapes."

00:27:08.206 --> 00:27:08.446 A:middle
Hmm.

00:27:08.896 --> 00:27:10.916 A:middle
"Are you suggesting we make it

00:27:10.916 --> 00:27:11.376 A:middle
generic?"

00:27:11.556 --> 00:27:12.056 A:middle
I asked.

00:27:12.676 --> 00:27:13.626 A:middle
"Isn't that premature

00:27:13.626 --> 00:27:14.426 A:middle
generalization?"

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:16.546 A:middle
Answering a question with a

00:27:16.546 --> 00:27:20.866 A:middle
question, Crusty replied, "Well,

00:27:20.866 --> 00:27:22.416 A:middle
just how do you plan to test

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.330 A:middle
this method?"

00:27:24.946 --> 00:27:26.736 A:middle
"Okay," I said, "I'll create a

00:27:26.736 --> 00:27:27.376 A:middle
canvas.

00:27:27.616 --> 00:27:28.726 A:middle
I'll add a bunch of random

00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:29.186 A:middle
shapes.

00:27:29.186 --> 00:27:30.886 A:middle
I'll select some of them, and

00:27:30.886 --> 00:27:31.676 A:middle
then finally..."

00:27:32.466 --> 00:27:33.776 A:middle
But I didn't even finish the

00:27:33.776 --> 00:27:35.506 A:middle
sentence because I knew it was a

00:27:35.506 --> 00:27:36.216 A:middle
bad idea.

00:27:37.076 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
If I did all of that, would I

00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:40.456 A:middle
really be testing my function,

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:42.066 A:middle
or would I be testing the

00:27:42.066 --> 00:27:43.646 A:middle
initializers of Canvas and

00:27:43.646 --> 00:27:45.606 A:middle
various shapes, the addShape

00:27:45.606 --> 00:27:47.776 A:middle
method, the isSelected property

00:27:47.976 --> 00:27:49.136 A:middle
of the various shapes if it's

00:27:49.136 --> 00:27:49.706 A:middle
computed?

00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:52.356 A:middle
I have to build test cases for

00:27:52.356 --> 00:27:54.506 A:middle
sure, but ideally, that code

00:27:54.736 --> 00:27:56.266 A:middle
shouldn't depend on other code

00:27:56.266 --> 00:27:57.826 A:middle
that I also have to test.

00:27:59.126 --> 00:28:00.506 A:middle
If I can bring the lozenges
