00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
But if you listen carefully, you

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.336 A:middle
can learn a thing or two.

00:02:03.576 --> 00:02:05.356 A:middle
Now, sometimes his cryptic

00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:07.666 A:middle
pronouncements like "programming

00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:10.156 A:middle
reveals the real; border on the

00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:10.675 A:middle
mystical."

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:13.576 A:middle
And to understand him, I found

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:15.096 A:middle
it helpful to actually write

00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:16.286 A:middle
some code.

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:18.796 A:middle
So, lately, I've been working on

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:20.586 A:middle
a little program called Shapes.

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.906 A:middle
I'm hoping to make it into a

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:24.216 A:middle
full-featured vector drawing

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.876 A:middle
program, but so far it lets you

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:28.336 A:middle
arrange shapes on an infinite

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:28.836 A:middle
canvas.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.376 A:middle
Now, I want to tell you the

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.226 A:middle
story of the delete selection

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:35.526 A:middle
command because I learned so

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:37.826 A:middle
much from implementing this one

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:38.266 A:middle
feature.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.216 A:middle
I think we've probably all gone

00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:43.426 A:middle
through part of this progression

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:45.436 A:middle
as programmers as we learn how

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:46.856 A:middle
to remove things from an array.

00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:49.106 A:middle
Everybody starts out doing

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.000 A:middle
something like this.

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:55.006 A:middle
That's the delete selection

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:57.026 A:middle
command.

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
We loop from 0 to count, and
