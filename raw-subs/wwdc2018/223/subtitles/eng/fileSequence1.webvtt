00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:00.056 A:middle
a new relationship to the

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:01.056 A:middle
practice of programming.

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:03.446 A:middle
Speaking personally, when I

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:05.116 A:middle
discovered this approach, it

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:06.446 A:middle
changed the course of my life

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:07.486 A:middle
and my career.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:09.926 A:middle
It's the reason I care so much

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:11.966 A:middle
about software libraries, but

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.786 A:middle
it's also the source of the

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:15.866 A:middle
liability, maintainability, and

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.976 A:middle
performance in every piece of

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:19.016 A:middle
concrete code I've written

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:19.436 A:middle
since.

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:22.876 A:middle
But before we get into that, let

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:24.226 A:middle
me introduce you to a friend of

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:24.396 A:middle
mine.

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:27.506 A:middle
This is Crusty.

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:31.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:34.006 A:middle
Crusty is old school.

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:37.026 A:middle
He doesn't trust debuggers or or

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:38.786 A:middle
mess around with integrated

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:40.016 A:middle
development environments.

00:01:40.806 --> 00:01:43.246 A:middle
No, he favors an 80 x 24

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:45.436 A:middle
terminal window in plain text,

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.246 A:middle
thank you very much.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:49.566 A:middle
Now, Crusty takes a dim view of

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.916 A:middle
the latest programming fads, so

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.476 A:middle
it can sometimes be an effort to

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:55.166 A:middle
drag him into the 21st century.

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:57.636 A:middle
He just thinks different.

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
But if you listen carefully, you
