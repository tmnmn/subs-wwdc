00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
selected shape, then move to its

00:25:01.746 --> 00:25:05.326 A:middle
predecessor, and isolate the

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:07.086 A:middle
section of the array that starts

00:25:07.086 --> 00:25:09.716 A:middle
there, we could just partition

00:25:10.556 --> 00:25:10.666 A:middle
that.

00:25:12.236 --> 00:25:14.166 A:middle
"But how do you modify just part

00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:14.776 A:middle
of a collection?"

00:25:14.976 --> 00:25:15.676 A:middle
I asked Crusty.

00:25:16.876 --> 00:25:17.746 A:middle
"Ain't you never heard of a

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:18.296 A:middle
slice?"

00:25:18.526 --> 00:25:19.516 A:middle
he said, taking over the

00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:19.946 A:middle
keyboard.

00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:25.106 A:middle
"Shapes, starting with

00:25:25.726 --> 00:25:26.336 A:middle
predecessor.

00:25:27.656 --> 00:25:28.256 A:middle
There.

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:29.596 A:middle
Stick that in your algorithm and

00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:30.146 A:middle
mutate it."

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.000 A:middle
Which I promptly did.

00:25:37.716 --> 00:25:41.456 A:middle
So, human knowledge about how to

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:43.096 A:middle
compute things correctly and

00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:44.976 A:middle
efficiently predates computers

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.156 A:middle
by thousands of years, going

00:25:47.156 --> 00:25:48.846 A:middle
back at least to ancient Egypt,

00:25:49.546 --> 00:25:50.656 A:middle
and since the invention of

00:25:50.656 --> 00:25:52.086 A:middle
computers, there's been an

00:25:52.086 --> 00:25:53.696 A:middle
explosion of work in this area.

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.586 A:middle
If the standard library doesn't

00:25:56.586 --> 00:25:58.386 A:middle
have what you need, what you do

00:25:58.386 --> 00:26:00.556 A:middle
need is probably out there with
