00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:00.126 A:middle
You'll even find a playground

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:00.846 A:middle
tutorial there.

00:16:01.906 --> 00:16:03.856 A:middle
Now, I realize there's a lot in

00:16:03.856 --> 00:16:05.436 A:middle
Swift, so it can look daunting,

00:16:06.196 --> 00:16:07.306 A:middle
but you don't need to remember

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:07.706 A:middle
everything.

00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:10.066 A:middle
Having an idea of what's there

00:16:10.066 --> 00:16:12.156 A:middle
and how to find it will take you

00:16:12.156 --> 00:16:13.326 A:middle
a long way.

00:16:14.396 --> 00:16:16.466 A:middle
Now, before we move on, I want

00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:18.326 A:middle
to point out something else that

00:16:18.326 --> 00:16:19.576 A:middle
happened in my code when Crusty

00:16:19.576 --> 00:16:20.276 A:middle
made this change.

00:16:21.136 --> 00:16:22.816 A:middle
Which one of these most directly

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.776 A:middle
describes its meaning?

00:16:24.346 --> 00:16:27.166 A:middle
Now, I actually have to read and

00:16:27.226 --> 00:16:28.406 A:middle
think through the first one to

00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:29.216 A:middle
know what it's doing.

00:16:30.086 --> 00:16:30.376 A:middle
Hmm.

00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:31.836 A:middle
Maybe I'd better add a comment.

00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:33.026 A:middle
Okay.

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:33.646 A:middle
How does that look?

00:16:34.196 --> 00:16:35.836 A:middle
Oh, even with that comment, the

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:37.156 A:middle
reverse iteration is kind of

00:16:37.156 --> 00:16:38.356 A:middle
tricky, and I don't want

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:39.776 A:middle
somebody breaking this code

00:16:39.776 --> 00:16:40.826 A:middle
because they don't understand

00:16:40.826 --> 00:16:40.946 A:middle
it.

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:45.046 A:middle
So, I'd better explain that.

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:45.726 A:middle
Okay.

00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:47.596 A:middle
While we're clarifying things,

00:16:47.656 --> 00:16:49.866 A:middle
the After code actually reads

00:16:49.866 --> 00:16:50.956 A:middle
better with a trailing closure

00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:51.606 A:middle
syntax.

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:54.896 A:middle
Now, take a breath and look

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:55.196 A:middle
again.

00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:57.936 A:middle
Which one is more obviously

00:16:57.936 --> 00:16:58.346 A:middle
correct?

00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:00.956 A:middle
Even with all these comments, I
