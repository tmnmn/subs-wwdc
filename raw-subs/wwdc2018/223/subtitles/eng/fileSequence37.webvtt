00:36:59.126 --> 00:37:02.716 A:middle
And then, finally, reinsert

00:37:02.716 --> 00:37:02.916 A:middle
them.

00:37:06.536 --> 00:37:08.806 A:middle
Honestly, I was a little scared

00:37:08.806 --> 00:37:10.726 A:middle
to touch the code because I

00:37:10.726 --> 00:37:12.156 A:middle
thought I finally had it right.

00:37:12.156 --> 00:37:14.276 A:middle
It had been almost a week since

00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:15.536 A:middle
the last time I discovered a new

00:37:15.536 --> 00:37:16.056 A:middle
bug.

00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:21.026 A:middle
But I had gotten pretty good at

00:37:21.026 --> 00:37:22.726 A:middle
this process now, so I tried

00:37:23.286 --> 00:37:24.766 A:middle
visualizing the operation

00:37:24.766 --> 00:37:28.976 A:middle
happening all at once.

00:37:29.106 --> 00:37:31.116 A:middle
Hey, that looks familiar.

00:37:31.326 --> 00:37:34.856 A:middle
Let's see it again.

00:37:35.056 --> 00:37:35.486 A:middle
Hmm.

00:37:36.946 --> 00:37:39.826 A:middle
Suppose we do this first, and

00:37:39.826 --> 00:37:40.926 A:middle
then take care of the parts

00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:41.456 A:middle
separately.

00:37:43.456 --> 00:37:44.246 A:middle
That's right.

00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:45.946 A:middle
This is just two stable

00:37:45.946 --> 00:37:48.036 A:middle
partitions with inverted

00:37:48.696 --> 00:37:48.976 A:middle
predicates.

00:37:49.596 --> 00:37:51.316 A:middle
So, the generic algorithm

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:52.846 A:middle
collapsed down to this

00:37:52.886 --> 00:37:56.716 A:middle
two-liner, and here's what's

00:37:56.716 --> 00:37:57.636 A:middle
left in canvas.

00:37:58.186 --> 00:38:01.126 A:middle
Now, let's just see that next to
