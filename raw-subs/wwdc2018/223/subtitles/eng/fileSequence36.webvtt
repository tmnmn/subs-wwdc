00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:01.016 A:middle
Now, they won't always have the

00:36:01.016 --> 00:36:03.126 A:middle
same length as they do in this

00:36:03.126 --> 00:36:06.716 A:middle
example, and fortunately there's

00:36:06.716 --> 00:36:07.986 A:middle
an algorithm for that.

00:36:08.906 --> 00:36:10.636 A:middle
We call it rotate.

00:36:11.176 --> 00:36:11.276 A:middle
Okay.

00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:16.496 A:middle
I'm not going to go into rotate

00:36:16.496 --> 00:36:18.226 A:middle
here, but it's actually quite

00:36:18.256 --> 00:36:19.156 A:middle
beautiful, and if you're

00:36:19.156 --> 00:36:20.686 A:middle
interested, you can find its

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:22.446 A:middle
implementation in the same file

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:23.436 A:middle
as stable partitions.

00:36:24.116 --> 00:36:24.216 A:middle
Okay.

00:36:25.596 --> 00:36:27.146 A:middle
Back to shapes.

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:32.486 A:middle
Now, this mess implemented the

00:36:32.696 --> 00:36:34.706 A:middle
dragging in the shapes list, and

00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:36.626 A:middle
it had always been one of my

00:36:36.626 --> 00:36:38.706 A:middle
most complicated and buggy

00:36:38.706 --> 00:36:39.326 A:middle
operations.

00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:41.616 A:middle
The strategy had been to

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.246 A:middle
allocate the temporary buffer;

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:46.486 A:middle
then, loop over the shapes

00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:48.506 A:middle
before the insertion point,

00:36:48.736 --> 00:36:50.196 A:middle
extracting the selected ones and

00:36:50.196 --> 00:36:51.576 A:middle
adjusting the insertion point,

00:36:52.526 --> 00:36:54.086 A:middle
and then separately loop over

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:55.896 A:middle
the rest of the shapes without

00:36:55.896 --> 00:36:57.236 A:middle
adjusting the insertion point,

00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:58.596 A:middle
extracting the selected ones.

00:36:59.126 --> 00:37:02.716 A:middle
And then, finally, reinsert
