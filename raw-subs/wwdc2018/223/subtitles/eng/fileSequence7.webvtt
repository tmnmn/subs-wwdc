00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.216 A:middle
number of steps proportional to

00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:02.476 A:middle
the length of the array."

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:04.456 A:middle
And it kind of makes sense,

00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.686 A:middle
since the array has to slide all

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.316 A:middle
of the following elements into

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:09.186 A:middle
their new positions.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.466 A:middle
"So, what's that mean about your

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:13.806 A:middle
Delete Selection command?"

00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:14.996 A:middle
he asked.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.646 A:middle
"Uh," I said.

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:21.606 A:middle
That's when he pulled out a pack

00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:22.976 A:middle
of mentholated lozenges and

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:24.086 A:middle
lined them up on my desk.

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:25.596 A:middle
"Try it yourself."

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.216 A:middle
So, I went through the process

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.226 A:middle
as I tried to answer his

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:30.656 A:middle
question.

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:32.096 A:middle
"Well, since Delete Selection

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:34.116 A:middle
has to do order n steps, once

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:35.486 A:middle
for each selected element, and

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:36.996 A:middle
you can select up to n elements,

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.396 A:middle
the total number of steps is

00:07:38.396 --> 00:07:40.906 A:middle
proportional to n squared."

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:44.356 A:middle
Crusty added, "That's quadratic,

00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:46.296 A:middle
son, whether you do it the ugly

00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:48.186 A:middle
forward way or the fancy pants

00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:50.346 A:middle
backward way."

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:54.106 A:middle
I realized then that for my

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.036 A:middle
little 10 to 20-element test

00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:58.006 A:middle
cases, we'd only been talking

00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:00.376 A:middle
about a few hundred steps, and
