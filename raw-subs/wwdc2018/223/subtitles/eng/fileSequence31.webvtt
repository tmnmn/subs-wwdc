00:30:58.346 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
does bringForward have to do

00:31:00.056 --> 00:31:01.846 A:middle
with having integer indices?"

00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:02.576 A:middle
I interrupted.

00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:04.416 A:middle
"Yeah, I know."

00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:07.466 A:middle
"Well, I do have to get the

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:10.156 A:middle
index before i, which I can do

00:31:10.156 --> 00:31:10.876 A:middle
with subtraction."

00:31:12.856 --> 00:31:14.976 A:middle
Crusty just sighed and broke out

00:31:14.976 --> 00:31:15.906 A:middle
the lozenges again.

00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:19.376 A:middle
And then, he laid two fingers

00:31:19.376 --> 00:31:22.156 A:middle
down on the desk and walked them

00:31:22.566 --> 00:31:24.966 A:middle
across until his right hand was

00:31:25.136 --> 00:31:26.706 A:middle
pointing at the first green

00:31:26.706 --> 00:31:27.276 A:middle
lozenge.

00:31:27.806 --> 00:31:31.446 A:middle
"Not a backwards step in the

00:31:31.446 --> 00:31:32.506 A:middle
whole dance," he said.

00:31:33.406 --> 00:31:35.286 A:middle
And I realized that Crusty had

00:31:35.286 --> 00:31:37.586 A:middle
just shown me a new algorithm.

00:31:38.636 --> 00:31:39.546 A:middle
Let's call that one

00:31:39.696 --> 00:31:40.986 A:middle
indexBeforeFirst.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:43.776 A:middle
"Now, the trick here is to keep

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:46.086 A:middle
your focus by assuming somebody

00:31:46.086 --> 00:31:46.976 A:middle
already wrote it for you."

00:31:47.826 --> 00:31:49.116 A:middle
And he proceeded to hack away

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.336 A:middle
all the code that we didn't

00:31:50.336 --> 00:31:53.906 A:middle
need, like that and that.

00:31:56.616 --> 00:32:00.866 A:middle
"Predecessor is the index before
