00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
We loop from 0 to count, and

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.326 A:middle
when we find something to

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:05.126 A:middle
delete, we [inaudible] remove

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:07.546 A:middle
that, and then we continue with

00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:11.266 A:middle
our loop until, ouch, we walk

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:11.846 A:middle
off the end.

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:14.906 A:middle
The array got shorter, but we

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:16.256 A:middle
picked the number of iterations

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:17.166 A:middle
when the loop started.

00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:19.196 A:middle
Fortunately, you can't miss this

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
bug if you Swift and test your

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:23.436 A:middle
code because it'll trap.

00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:25.226 A:middle
But if you had to learn this

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.996 A:middle
lesson as a C-programmer, like I

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:28.966 A:middle
did, you might not be so lucky.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:30.256 A:middle
Okay.

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.796 A:middle
So, we can fix it by replacing

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.096 A:middle
the for loop with a somewhat

00:03:34.096 --> 00:03:36.346 A:middle
uglier while loop, which lets us

00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:37.516 A:middle
examine the count at each

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:38.096 A:middle
iteration.

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:42.156 A:middle
But there's a subtle bug in this

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:42.736 A:middle
one too.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.056 A:middle
If two consecutive elements are

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:48.706 A:middle
selected, it'll remove the first

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:51.916 A:middle
one and then immediately hop

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:54.256 A:middle
over the next one.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.956 A:middle
Now, this bug is a little more

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.496 A:middle
insidious because it hides from

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:00.286 A:middle
you unless your tests happen to
