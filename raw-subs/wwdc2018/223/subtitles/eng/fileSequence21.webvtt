It moves the selected shapes to

00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:03.406 A:middle
the front, maintaining their

00:21:03.406 --> 00:21:04.176 A:middle
relative order."

00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:07.136 A:middle
"Write that down in a dot

00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:08.376 A:middle
comment and read it back to me."

00:21:10.406 --> 00:21:13.146 A:middle
I'm a superfast typist.

00:21:15.236 --> 00:21:17.416 A:middle
"Moves the selected shapes to

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.496 A:middle
the front, maintaining their

00:21:18.496 --> 00:21:19.286 A:middle
relative order."

00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:21.766 A:middle
"Sound familiar?"

00:21:22.186 --> 00:21:22.796 A:middle
said Crusty.

00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:25.276 A:middle
That's when I realized that this

00:21:25.276 --> 00:21:26.736 A:middle
was a lot like half stable

00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:29.286 A:middle
partition, except it's fully

00:21:29.286 --> 00:21:29.676 A:middle
stable.

00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:32.046 A:middle
I was starting to get excited.

00:21:32.556 --> 00:21:33.776 A:middle
And what do you think this one

00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:34.226 A:middle
is called?

00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:36.516 A:middle
So, I had to guess, "Stable

00:21:36.516 --> 00:21:37.026 A:middle
partition?"

00:21:37.566 --> 00:21:38.346 A:middle
"That's right.

00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:41.126 A:middle
One of my old favorites, and you

00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:42.426 A:middle
can find an implementation in

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:43.946 A:middle
this here file from the Swift

00:21:43.946 --> 00:21:45.486 A:middle
Open Source project."

00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:48.396 A:middle
So, I pulled the file into my

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:50.006 A:middle
project, while Crusty mumbled

00:21:50.006 --> 00:21:51.266 A:middle
something about how that comment

00:21:51.266 --> 00:21:52.206 A:middle
we added should have been there

00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:55.756 A:middle
all along, and I started coding,

00:21:56.936 --> 00:21:59.526 A:middle
getting about this far before I

00:21:59.526 --> 00:22:00.196 A:middle
had a problem.
