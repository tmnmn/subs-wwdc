00:33:57.666 --> 00:34:01.966 A:middle
Now, as an app developer, you

00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:03.746 A:middle
are working at the very top of a

00:34:03.746 --> 00:34:05.356 A:middle
tower that stretches through

00:34:05.356 --> 00:34:07.966 A:middle
your system frameworks, DOS, and

00:34:07.966 --> 00:34:09.556 A:middle
into the hardware, which rests

00:34:10.146 --> 00:34:11.216 A:middle
on the laws of physics.

00:34:12.815 --> 00:34:14.096 A:middle
But as soon as you call one of

00:34:14.096 --> 00:34:15.936 A:middle
your own methods, it becomes

00:34:15.936 --> 00:34:18.146 A:middle
part of your foundation; so,

00:34:18.146 --> 00:34:19.666 A:middle
document your code.

00:34:20.235 --> 00:34:21.565 A:middle
The intern was hired, by the

00:34:21.565 --> 00:34:23.946 A:middle
way, and he's sitting right

00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:26.406 A:middle
there.

00:34:26.616 --> 00:34:28.896 A:middle
So, I took the hint and

00:34:28.896 --> 00:34:29.936 A:middle
documented Crusty's new

00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:32.956 A:middle
algorithm, which meant that we

00:34:32.956 --> 00:34:33.716 A:middle
could forget about the

00:34:33.716 --> 00:34:36.956 A:middle
implementation and just use it,

00:34:37.206 --> 00:34:38.306 A:middle
knowing that Quick Help had

00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:39.416 A:middle
everything that we needed.

00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:42.856 A:middle
Now, I also documented

00:34:42.856 --> 00:34:43.496 A:middle
bringForward.

00:34:45.956 --> 00:34:46.565 A:middle
Cool!

00:34:48.136 --> 00:34:49.456 A:middle
Now, because it seemed to be

00:34:49.456 --> 00:34:51.626 A:middle
solving all of my problems, at

00:34:51.626 --> 00:34:53.496 A:middle
this point, I was really curious

00:34:53.496 --> 00:34:55.786 A:middle
to see what was going on inside

00:34:55.786 --> 00:34:56.596 A:middle
stablePartition.

00:34:57.806 --> 00:34:59.456 A:middle
It turns out I was well rewarded

00:34:59.526 --> 00:35:01.416 A:middle
because it's a really beautiful
