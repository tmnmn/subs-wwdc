operations, remove(at:) and

00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:02.756 A:middle
insert(at:), which makes this,

00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:04.786 A:middle
you guessed it, n squared.

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:08.526 A:middle
In fact, that same problem

00:20:08.526 --> 00:20:10.076 A:middle
showed up in every one of my

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:11.076 A:middle
other four commands.

00:20:12.516 --> 00:20:14.046 A:middle
All of the implementations here

00:20:14.386 --> 00:20:16.196 A:middle
loop over an array, performing

00:20:16.196 --> 00:20:17.936 A:middle
insertions and removals, which

00:20:17.936 --> 00:20:19.126 A:middle
means they're all quadratic.

00:20:19.626 --> 00:20:23.096 A:middle
Now, I was kind of discouraged

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:24.996 A:middle
at this point, so I asked Crusty

00:20:24.996 --> 00:20:26.106 A:middle
if he'd look at them with me.

00:20:27.406 --> 00:20:29.106 A:middle
He said, "Can't stay too late,"

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.156 A:middle
he said, "I got my ballroom

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:33.096 A:middle
dancing tonight, but I guess we

00:20:33.226 --> 00:20:34.546 A:middle
better get a move on."

00:20:35.306 --> 00:20:37.486 A:middle
So, I pulled up bringToFront,

00:20:38.686 --> 00:20:40.946 A:middle
and Crusty's first question was,

00:20:42.156 --> 00:20:44.546 A:middle
"What does it actually do?"

00:20:45.846 --> 00:20:47.566 A:middle
"Well," I said, "there's a while

00:20:47.566 --> 00:20:49.426 A:middle
loop and j tracks the insertion

00:20:49.426 --> 00:20:51.266 A:middle
point and i tracks the element

00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:51.906 A:middle
we're looking at."

00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:54.216 A:middle
"In words, not in codes," said

00:20:54.246 --> 00:20:54.666 A:middle
Crusty.

00:20:55.706 --> 00:20:57.126 A:middle
"Describe it."

00:20:58.146 --> 00:20:59.286 A:middle
"Okay. Let's see.

00:20:59.776 --> 00:21:01.616 A:middle
It moves the selected shapes to
