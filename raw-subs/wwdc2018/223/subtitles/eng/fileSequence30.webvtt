00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:00.826 A:middle
So, there's a simple fix for

00:30:00.826 --> 00:30:01.000 A:middle
this, right?

00:30:04.216 --> 00:30:04.936 A:middle
Have you done this?

00:30:06.176 --> 00:30:08.106 A:middle
Don't do this.

00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:11.326 A:middle
It compiled, but Crusty had

00:30:11.326 --> 00:30:12.586 A:middle
suddenly stopped dancing, and I

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:15.156 A:middle
knew something was wrong.

00:30:15.366 --> 00:30:16.166 A:middle
"What?" I said.

00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:18.836 A:middle
"Rookies always do that," said

00:30:18.836 --> 00:30:20.036 A:middle
Crusty, shaking his head.

00:30:21.566 --> 00:30:23.216 A:middle
"First, you got that comparison

00:30:23.216 --> 00:30:24.736 A:middle
with 0, which is going to be

00:30:24.736 --> 00:30:26.056 A:middle
wrong for array slice.

00:30:26.686 --> 00:30:29.456 A:middle
So, did you know that array

00:30:29.456 --> 00:30:31.596 A:middle
slices, their indices don't

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:32.216 A:middle
start at 0?

00:30:32.216 --> 00:30:35.696 A:middle
The indices of all slices start

00:30:35.966 --> 00:30:37.506 A:middle
with the corresponding index in

00:30:37.506 --> 00:30:38.786 A:middle
the underlying collection that

00:30:38.786 --> 00:30:40.246 A:middle
they were sliced from.

00:30:40.796 --> 00:30:42.976 A:middle
That relationship is critical if

00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:44.126 A:middle
you want to be able to compose

00:30:44.126 --> 00:30:46.466 A:middle
generic algorithms using slices,

00:30:47.056 --> 00:30:47.946 A:middle
so it's really important."

00:30:49.156 --> 00:30:51.946 A:middle
Well, this problem, I knew to

00:30:51.946 --> 00:30:52.406 A:middle
fix.

00:30:53.146 --> 00:30:54.126 A:middle
Just compare it with start

00:30:54.126 --> 00:30:54.516 A:middle
index.

00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:58.346 A:middle
But the real problem is "What

00:30:58.346 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
does bringForward have to do
