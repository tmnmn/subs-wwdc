need is probably out there with

00:26:00.556 --> 00:26:03.396 A:middle
tests, with documentation, often

00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:04.786 A:middle
with a proof of correctness.

research that applies to your

00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:10.086 A:middle
problem domain.

00:26:12.716 --> 00:26:12.946 A:middle
Okay.

00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:13.596 A:middle
Back to the code.

00:26:14.076 --> 00:26:15.656 A:middle
I was intrigued by this slice

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:17.136 A:middle
thing, and when I checked out

00:26:17.136 --> 00:26:19.596 A:middle
its type, I saw that it wasn't

00:26:19.596 --> 00:26:20.156 A:middle
an array.

00:26:20.716 --> 00:26:23.306 A:middle
Since we had used stable

00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:24.876 A:middle
partition on an array and

00:26:24.876 --> 00:26:27.216 A:middle
bringToFront and sendToBack, and

00:26:27.216 --> 00:26:28.776 A:middle
now we were using it on an array

00:26:28.776 --> 00:26:30.876 A:middle
slice, I guessed out loud that

00:26:30.876 --> 00:26:32.496 A:middle
it must be generic.

00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:34.636 A:middle
"Of course, it is.

00:26:35.176 --> 00:26:36.446 A:middle
What's stable partition got to

00:26:36.446 --> 00:26:37.846 A:middle
do with the specifics of array?"

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.436 A:middle
"That's right, nothing.

00:26:41.336 --> 00:26:44.046 A:middle
Speaking of which, Blonkey, just

00:26:44.046 --> 00:26:45.416 A:middle
what does bringForward have to

00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:46.946 A:middle
do with shapes and selection?"

00:26:48.616 --> 00:26:51.166 A:middle
"Well," I said, "it works on

00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:52.876 A:middle
shapes, and it brings forward

00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:53.796 A:middle
the selected ones."

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:55.936 A:middle
"That's right, nothing," he went

00:26:55.936 --> 00:26:56.736 A:middle
on without listening.

00:26:58.636 --> 00:27:00.006 A:middle
"Can you run bring forward on a
