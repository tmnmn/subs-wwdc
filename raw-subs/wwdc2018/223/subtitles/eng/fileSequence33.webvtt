00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:00.586 A:middle
he asked.

00:33:00.586 --> 00:33:02.306 A:middle
I didn't know what he was

00:33:02.306 --> 00:33:02.906 A:middle
talking about.

00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
The code was clean, and it

00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:05.666 A:middle
worked.

00:33:07.016 --> 00:33:08.336 A:middle
"Semantics, son.

00:33:09.046 --> 00:33:10.216 A:middle
How am I supposed to use these

00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:11.416 A:middle
from other code if I don't know

00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:12.156 A:middle
what they mean?"

00:33:12.786 --> 00:33:17.156 A:middle
And that's when I realized every

00:33:17.156 --> 00:33:18.926 A:middle
time we'd use the new algorithm,

00:33:19.446 --> 00:33:20.326 A:middle
we had leaned on his

00:33:20.326 --> 00:33:21.936 A:middle
documentation to draw

00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:23.416 A:middle
conclusions about the meaning

00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:25.296 A:middle
and efficiency of our own code.

00:33:26.346 --> 00:33:27.846 A:middle
And because most algorithms are

00:33:27.846 --> 00:33:29.456 A:middle
built out of other algorithms,

00:33:29.896 --> 00:33:32.816 A:middle
they lean on the same thing.

00:33:33.026 --> 00:33:34.826 A:middle
Recently, I was interviewing a

00:33:34.826 --> 00:33:36.486 A:middle
perspective intern and asked him

00:33:36.486 --> 00:33:38.236 A:middle
about the role of documentation,

00:33:38.636 --> 00:33:40.226 A:middle
and he began with a phrase I

00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:41.156 A:middle
won't forget.

00:33:41.966 --> 00:33:43.306 A:middle
"Oh, it's incredibly important,"

00:33:43.776 --> 00:33:44.206 A:middle
he said.

00:33:45.646 --> 00:33:46.816 A:middle
"We're building these towers of

00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:48.996 A:middle
abstraction," and now I'm

00:33:48.996 --> 00:33:50.946 A:middle
paraphrasing, "the reason we can

00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:52.286 A:middle
build without constantly

00:33:52.286 --> 00:33:54.086 A:middle
inspecting the layers below us

00:33:54.706 --> 00:33:56.036 A:middle
is that the parts that we build

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:57.176 A:middle
on are documented."

00:33:57.666 --> 00:34:01.966 A:middle
Now, as an app developer, you
