00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:01.156 A:middle
spot was right here, but beyond

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:02.056 A:middle
that, I was stumped.

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:05.636 A:middle
So, just about then, Crusty

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:07.076 A:middle
walked up behind me carrying a

00:06:07.076 --> 00:06:09.416 A:middle
can of off-brand coffee grounds

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:10.796 A:middle
from the local supermarket for

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
his daily brew.

00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:15.876 A:middle
"Stuck?" he said.

00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:18.016 A:middle
"Yeah," I sighed, and I

00:06:18.016 --> 00:06:19.216 A:middle
explained the situation.

00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:24.556 A:middle
"Well, did you even look at the

00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:25.796 A:middle
documentation for that?"

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:29.916 A:middle
Well, I hadn't, so I popped up

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:31.516 A:middle
the Quick Help for Remove At,

00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:33.526 A:middle
and Crusty leaned in.

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:35.856 A:middle
"There's your problem, right

00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:38.986 A:middle
there," he said, leaving a

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:40.506 A:middle
smudge on my gorgeous retina

00:06:40.506 --> 00:06:41.036 A:middle
display.

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:45.506 A:middle
Now, I carefully wiped off the

00:06:45.546 --> 00:06:47.216 A:middle
fingerprint with a handcrafted

00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:50.596 A:middle
Italian microfiber cloth, and

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:53.386 A:middle
Crusty said, "What's that tell

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:54.856 A:middle
you, son?"

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:57.516 A:middle
"Well," I said, "it means that

00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:59.056 A:middle
removing an element takes a
