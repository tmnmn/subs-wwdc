00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:01.126 A:middle
j, and there's a single loop,

00:15:01.616 --> 00:15:04.906 A:middle
and the loop index j moves

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:06.646 A:middle
forward one on each iteration.

00:15:07.696 --> 00:15:09.196 A:middle
So, it's a sure bet that j makes

00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:10.716 A:middle
just one pass over the elements.

00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:14.086 A:middle
You can almost see the order and

00:15:14.086 --> 00:15:20.306 A:middle
complexity just from that.

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:22.106 A:middle
Lastly, because this method

00:15:22.106 --> 00:15:23.526 A:middle
needs to rearrange elements but

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:24.726 A:middle
not change the length or

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:26.396 A:middle
structure of the collection, it

00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:27.506 A:middle
only depends on mutable

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:28.606 A:middle
collection conformance.

00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:32.366 A:middle
So, this is the first lesson I

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:32.676 A:middle
learned.

00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:34.966 A:middle
Become familiar with what's in

00:15:34.966 --> 00:15:36.166 A:middle
the Swift Standard Library.

00:15:37.176 --> 00:15:38.606 A:middle
It contains a suite of

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:40.416 A:middle
algorithms with documented

00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:41.486 A:middle
meanings and performance

00:15:41.486 --> 00:15:42.316 A:middle
characteristics.

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:45.526 A:middle
And although we happened to peek

00:15:45.526 --> 00:15:47.416 A:middle
at the implementation, and you

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:49.126 A:middle
can learn a lot that way, it's

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:50.786 A:middle
designed so that you do not have

00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:50.946 A:middle
to.

00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:53.756 A:middle
The official documentation

00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:55.046 A:middle
should tell you everything you

00:15:55.046 --> 00:15:56.856 A:middle
need to know in order to use the

00:15:56.856 --> 00:15:58.006 A:middle
library effectively.

00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:00.126 A:middle
You'll even find a playground
