00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:00.966 A:middle
Does it make sense for it to be

00:14:01.356 --> 00:14:02.406 A:middle
any arbitrary string?

00:14:02.896 --> 00:14:04.916 A:middle
No, and in my case, I want to

00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:05.876 A:middle
make sure that it actually

00:14:05.876 --> 00:14:06.706 A:middle
represents a URL.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.366 A:middle
But more importantly, just

00:14:09.366 --> 00:14:10.646 A:middle
because it looks like a URL,

00:14:10.646 --> 00:14:11.956 A:middle
doesn't mean it will point to my

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:12.426 A:middle
domain.

00:14:12.916 --> 00:14:13.916 A:middle
And this is something I care

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:14.866 A:middle
very deeply about.

00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:16.976 A:middle
I really, really want to keep my

00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:17.736 A:middle
customers safe.

00:14:17.736 --> 00:14:19.466 A:middle
I don't want to possibly send

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:21.266 A:middle
them to a phishing domain, which

00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:23.056 A:middle
could look like mine, but not

00:14:23.056 --> 00:14:23.936 A:middle
really be my site.

00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:26.476 A:middle
So, this is something that I

00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:29.046 A:middle
care about watching out for.

00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:30.986 A:middle
Now, lastly, even if each of

00:14:30.986 --> 00:14:32.656 A:middle
these fields is valid on its

00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:34.126 A:middle
own, sometimes the relationships

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:35.376 A:middle
between fields that matters.

00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:38.026 A:middle
For instance, each product

00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:39.186 A:middle
listing has a date when it was

00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:40.446 A:middle
created, and a date when it was

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.126 A:middle
last updated.

00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:43.276 A:middle
Each of these can be valid on

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:44.486 A:middle
their own, but does it make

00:14:44.486 --> 00:14:45.566 A:middle
sense for the date that it was

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:47.256 A:middle
last updated to come before when

00:14:47.256 --> 00:14:47.936 A:middle
it was created?

00:14:49.106 --> 00:14:50.716 A:middle
No. And in my case, this might

00:14:50.716 --> 00:14:51.636 A:middle
not open a security

00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:52.406 A:middle
vulnerability in my app.

00:14:52.406 --> 00:14:54.436 A:middle
But this is something that maybe

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:55.536 A:middle
you watch out for because it's a

00:14:55.536 --> 00:14:56.946 A:middle
good indicator that something's

00:14:56.946 --> 00:14:57.946 A:middle
gone wrong, and maybe I

00:14:57.946 --> 00:14:58.966 A:middle
shouldn't trust this data.

00:14:58.966 --> 00:15:01.736 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how we
