00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:00.816 A:middle
actually is a URL, and not just

00:16:00.816 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
a garbage string.

00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:02.846 A:middle
And again, if anything goes

00:16:02.916 --> 00:16:04.006 A:middle
wrong, I'll throw an error.

00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.806 A:middle
But, again, I don't want to stop

00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:08.456 A:middle
there, once I have an actual

00:16:08.456 --> 00:16:09.926 A:middle
URL, I want to make sure it

00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:11.376 A:middle
points to my domain and not a

00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:13.016 A:middle
phishing domain, so I'll keep

00:16:13.016 --> 00:16:15.206 A:middle
working with that.

00:16:15.406 --> 00:16:16.736 A:middle
Now, at this point, I can apply

00:16:16.736 --> 00:16:17.886 A:middle
the same types of validation to

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:18.716 A:middle
the other fields here.

00:16:18.966 --> 00:16:20.096 A:middle
And again, if anything goes

00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:20.936 A:middle
wrong, I'll throw an error.

00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:22.936 A:middle
But once I have this function, I

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:24.686 A:middle
can apply it to all the product

00:16:24.686 --> 00:16:25.866 A:middle
listings that I've loaded from

00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:26.256 A:middle
the payload.

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:29.436 A:middle
And again, I'll stop executing

00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:33.716 A:middle
if anything goes wrong.

00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:35.426 A:middle
Now, this is how we can work to

00:16:35.426 --> 00:16:36.476 A:middle
validate primitive data.

00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:38.256 A:middle
But as we just saw, primitive

00:16:38.256 --> 00:16:39.306 A:middle
data can be very general.

00:16:40.706 --> 00:16:43.906 A:middle
A string can be a string, but it

00:16:43.906 --> 00:16:45.416 A:middle
can also be a date.

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:48.376 A:middle
And it can also be a URL.

00:16:50.236 --> 00:16:52.086 A:middle
Sometimes we care to work with

00:16:52.126 --> 00:16:53.466 A:middle
data with the semantics that

00:16:53.556 --> 00:16:54.356 A:middle
matter to us.

00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:55.986 A:middle
We wanted to make sure that the

00:16:55.986 --> 00:16:57.866 A:middle
host of that URL was our domain,

00:16:57.866 --> 00:16:59.116 A:middle
and we can't do that with just a

00:16:59.116 --> 00:16:59.796 A:middle
regular string.
