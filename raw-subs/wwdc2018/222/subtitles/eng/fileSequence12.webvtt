00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:01.046 A:middle
any product listings that don't

00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:02.416 A:middle
have a valid list of tags.

00:12:03.226 --> 00:12:04.336 A:middle
I could throw an error, but in

00:12:04.336 --> 00:12:07.356 A:middle
this case, I chose not to.

00:12:07.876 --> 00:12:09.456 A:middle
Now, type validation isn't the

00:12:09.456 --> 00:12:10.986 A:middle
only form of validation that you

00:12:10.986 --> 00:12:12.546 A:middle
want to perform at this stage.

00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:14.986 A:middle
For instance, if that had been

00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:16.266 A:middle
replaced by null, which is

00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:18.856 A:middle
totally valid in JSON, I

00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:20.556 A:middle
would've seen a similar crash.

00:12:21.876 --> 00:12:23.876 A:middle
In Swift strong static type

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:25.176 A:middle
system nullability is part of

00:12:25.176 --> 00:12:25.556 A:middle
the type.

00:12:25.556 --> 00:12:27.346 A:middle
And indeed, you can't downcast

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.166 A:middle
null to a string.

00:12:28.616 --> 00:12:30.416 A:middle
And so, again, this cast would

00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:32.356 A:middle
have failed.

00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:34.696 A:middle
Now, even if all of these values

00:12:34.696 --> 00:12:35.746 A:middle
are of the correct type and

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:37.186 A:middle
nullability, there's other forms

00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:38.136 A:middle
of validations that we should

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:38.786 A:middle
care about here.

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:41.236 A:middle
For instance, I said that each

00:12:41.296 --> 00:12:42.666 A:middle
product listing has a positive

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:43.196 A:middle
integer ID.

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:44.246 A:middle
In my case, they're all

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:45.296 A:middle
sequential integers.

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.076 A:middle
Does it make sense for one of

00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:48.216 A:middle
these IDs to be negative?

00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:49.926 A:middle
No, it doesn't.

00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:51.366 A:middle
But even if it is always

00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:53.026 A:middle
positive, does it make sense for

00:12:53.026 --> 00:12:54.486 A:middle
it to be such a large positive

00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:55.176 A:middle
integer value?

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.406 A:middle
I'm not selling that many

00:12:57.406 --> 00:12:57.776 A:middle
things.

00:12:58.036 --> 00:12:58.786 A:middle
So, no it doesn't.

00:12:58.786 --> 00:12:59.886 A:middle
and in this case, this might be

00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
due to somebody trying to cause
