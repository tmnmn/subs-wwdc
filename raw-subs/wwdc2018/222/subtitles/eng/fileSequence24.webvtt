00:23:58.586 --> 00:24:00.636 A:middle
both conforming to NSCoding, and

00:24:00.636 --> 00:24:01.846 A:middle
the superclass adopts

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:04.066 A:middle
NSSecureCoding conformance, the

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:05.516 A:middle
subclass will inherit that

00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:06.176 A:middle
conformance.

00:24:06.786 --> 00:24:09.436 A:middle
Now, the subclass may never have

00:24:09.436 --> 00:24:11.406 A:middle
had a chance to rewrite its init

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.656 A:middle
with coder to do the secure

00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:12.986 A:middle
thing.

00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:14.956 A:middle
And so, we have an escape hatch

00:24:15.586 --> 00:24:15.676 A:middle
here.

00:24:16.816 --> 00:24:18.126 A:middle
The support secure coding

00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:19.386 A:middle
method, allows you to say,

00:24:19.386 --> 00:24:21.226 A:middle
actually I don't really support

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:22.936 A:middle
secure coding, and you can turn

00:24:22.936 --> 00:24:25.136 A:middle
this off to say, I'm not ready

00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:26.566 A:middle
yet.

00:24:26.776 --> 00:24:28.826 A:middle
Alternatively, if you still say

00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:30.466 A:middle
yes, we have to make sure that

00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:32.736 A:middle
you either inherited the full

00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:34.276 A:middle
conformance to NSSecureCoding

00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:36.256 A:middle
from the superclass, or that you

00:24:36.256 --> 00:24:38.086 A:middle
overrode both of the methods to

00:24:38.086 --> 00:24:40.126 A:middle
indicate yes I really do support

00:24:40.126 --> 00:24:40.796 A:middle
secure coding.

00:24:40.986 --> 00:24:43.696 A:middle
There isn't a mismatch here.

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:45.716 A:middle
In our case, purchase meets both

00:24:45.716 --> 00:24:47.106 A:middle
of these requirements and so we

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:49.186 A:middle
can safely decode it from the

00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:49.986 A:middle
archive.

00:24:50.946 --> 00:24:52.826 A:middle
Now, we go ahead and decode a

00:24:52.886 --> 00:24:54.976 A:middle
purchase, it itself decodes a

00:24:54.976 --> 00:24:55.416 A:middle
listing.

00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:56.806 A:middle
And it can make use of the same

00:24:56.806 --> 00:24:58.206 A:middle
type of call to indicate that it

00:24:58.206 --> 00:24:58.906 A:middle
wants a listing.

00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:01.786 A:middle
When it does that
