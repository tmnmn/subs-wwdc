00:31:58.996 --> 00:32:00.426 A:middle
SecureCoding on when archiving.

00:32:00.426 --> 00:32:01.636 A:middle
And this is equally important

00:32:02.116 --> 00:32:03.386 A:middle
because it makes sure you can't

00:32:03.386 --> 00:32:05.026 A:middle
accidentally archive an object

00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:06.336 A:middle
which doesn't conform to

00:32:06.336 --> 00:32:07.136 A:middle
NSSecureCoding.

00:32:07.406 --> 00:32:08.616 A:middle
And you wouldn't later able to

00:32:08.616 --> 00:32:09.096 A:middle
decode it.

00:32:10.096 --> 00:32:11.786 A:middle
And again, the old initializer

00:32:11.786 --> 00:32:12.816 A:middle
and convenience methods are

00:32:12.816 --> 00:32:13.386 A:middle
deprecated.

00:32:13.896 --> 00:32:14.856 A:middle
And so, this means that if you

00:32:14.856 --> 00:32:15.996 A:middle
have old code that looks like

00:32:16.036 --> 00:32:19.026 A:middle
this, well turn on SecureCoding

00:32:19.026 --> 00:32:19.716 A:middle
when archiving.

00:32:20.446 --> 00:32:21.716 A:middle
And switch to the convenience

00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:22.986 A:middle
methods that allow you to pass

00:32:22.986 --> 00:32:23.946 A:middle
in that type information

00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:24.346 A:middle
upfront.

00:32:25.606 --> 00:32:26.826 A:middle
This way, you can actually make

00:32:26.826 --> 00:32:28.166 A:middle
use of your SecureCoding badge.

00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:29.486 A:middle
Make sure you've earned it.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:32.636 A:middle
Now, if you can't yet support

00:32:32.636 --> 00:32:33.956 A:middle
SecureCoding, because your types

00:32:33.956 --> 00:32:35.876 A:middle
can't conform, or they,

00:32:35.876 --> 00:32:37.226 A:middle
themselves depend on types which

00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:38.596 A:middle
don't yet conform, that's okay.

00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:39.996 A:middle
You can still use these methods.

00:32:40.756 --> 00:32:42.666 A:middle
On nCode, simply turn off the

00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:43.756 A:middle
secure coding requirement.

00:32:44.226 --> 00:32:45.396 A:middle
And on decode, these

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:46.666 A:middle
conveniences always have

00:32:46.666 --> 00:32:47.586 A:middle
SecureCoding enabled.

00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:50.096 A:middle
So, instead use the new

00:32:50.096 --> 00:32:51.196 A:middle
initializer to create a

00:32:51.196 --> 00:32:52.816 A:middle
KeyedUnarchiver, and then turn

00:32:52.816 --> 00:32:54.476 A:middle
SecureCoding off, manually.

00:32:55.776 --> 00:32:56.536 A:middle
This also gives you the

00:32:56.536 --> 00:32:58.026 A:middle
opportunity to reset the

00:32:58.026 --> 00:32:59.456 A:middle
decoding failure policy back to

00:32:59.456 --> 00:33:01.586 A:middle
the old default in case you need
