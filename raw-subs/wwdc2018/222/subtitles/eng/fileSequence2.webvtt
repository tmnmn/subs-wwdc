00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.236 A:middle
And specifically, we're going to

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:02.026 A:middle
be talking about how to build

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:03.886 A:middle
trust in data, by making sure of

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:04.406 A:middle
two things.

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:07.026 A:middle
One, that the data that we're

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.166 A:middle
going to be using, hasn't been

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.726 A:middle
modified from underneath us, and

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:12.266 A:middle
two that it contains what we

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.236 A:middle
expect it to in the format and

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:15.066 A:middle
structure that we want.

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:19.266 A:middle
So, we'll do just that by taking

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.816 A:middle
a look at the lifecycle of our

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.786 A:middle
data, and what we can validate

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:24.526 A:middle
about that data at every stage

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:25.146 A:middle
in the lifecycle.

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:28.836 A:middle
Then, we'll see what sort of

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:30.286 A:middle
type-level validation we can

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:31.606 A:middle
apply with the NS Secure coding

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:32.016 A:middle
protocol.

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:33.986 A:middle
And then apply those same

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.626 A:middle
concepts to codable types.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:40.256 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:41.536 A:middle
In order to talk about data,

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:42.576 A:middle
we're going to want to build a

00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:44.426 A:middle
mental model of the forms that

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.426 A:middle
data can take within our app.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.626 A:middle
At the most basic level, data

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.786 A:middle
makes its way into our app as a

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:52.756 A:middle
stream of bites.

00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:55.396 A:middle
There's not much we can tell

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:56.426 A:middle
about this data at this stage

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.156 A:middle
without looking at it, but this

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:00.976 A:middle
we'll call raw data.
