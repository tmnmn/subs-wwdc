00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.646 A:middle
will fail because they're not

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:03.246 A:middle
strings and we never checked to

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:04.516 A:middle
make sure they work before we

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:04.846 A:middle
cast.

00:11:06.706 --> 00:11:08.206 A:middle
So, to avoid this, our main

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:09.476 A:middle
tenant for the day will always

00:11:09.476 --> 00:11:11.616 A:middle
be validate first, execute

00:11:11.616 --> 00:11:11.886 A:middle
later.

00:11:13.186 --> 00:11:14.216 A:middle
Instead of asserting that you

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:15.206 A:middle
know what the structure of the

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:16.776 A:middle
data is, check first.

00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:18.436 A:middle
Don't blindly assume.

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:20.246 A:middle
So, let's see how we can do

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.316 A:middle
that.

00:11:21.646 --> 00:11:22.926 A:middle
So, here again is that first

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:23.926 A:middle
forced downcast.

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:25.376 A:middle
And instead of forcibly

00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:27.646 A:middle
downcasting these values, I can

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:29.466 A:middle
conditionally downcast.

00:11:32.336 --> 00:11:35.756 A:middle
This allows me to validate that

00:11:35.756 --> 00:11:37.366 A:middle
the data actually contains what

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:39.696 A:middle
I want and if that cast fails,

00:11:40.716 --> 00:11:41.936 A:middle
well I can handle that error

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:42.966 A:middle
instead of fatally erroring.

00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:45.666 A:middle
Now, similarly, later

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:47.476 A:middle
downcasting that list of

00:11:47.476 --> 00:11:49.136 A:middle
strings, instead of forcibly

00:11:49.136 --> 00:11:50.766 A:middle
downcasting, again I can

00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:52.106 A:middle
conditionally downcast.

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:53.596 A:middle
And in this case, instead of

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:55.396 A:middle
throwing an error, I can give a

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:56.606 A:middle
default value that allows

00:11:56.606 --> 00:11:57.696 A:middle
execution to continue.

00:11:57.846 --> 00:11:59.526 A:middle
In this case, I'll simply ignore

00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:01.046 A:middle
any product listings that don't
