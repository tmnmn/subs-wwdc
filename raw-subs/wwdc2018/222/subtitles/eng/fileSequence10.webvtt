00:10:00.446 --> 00:10:02.126 A:middle
So, will filter out any products

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:03.246 A:middle
that don't contain the music

00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:03.546 A:middle
tag.

00:10:03.546 --> 00:10:04.676 A:middle
And here, I have that

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:05.316 A:middle
substructure.

00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:06.416 A:middle
That list of tags, which will

00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:08.256 A:middle
downcast an array of strings and

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:11.386 A:middle
make use of it, right.

00:10:11.596 --> 00:10:14.696 A:middle
Whoops. Each of those forced

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:16.176 A:middle
downcasts, actually contains a

00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:17.146 A:middle
hidden fatal error.

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:19.736 A:middle
If either of those casts fails

00:10:20.046 --> 00:10:21.996 A:middle
because the API changed or the

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.326 A:middle
data changed along the way

00:10:23.326 --> 00:10:24.506 A:middle
before it made into my app,

00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:26.266 A:middle
again due to data corruption or

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:28.496 A:middle
malicious changing, those

00:10:28.496 --> 00:10:29.486 A:middle
downcasts will fail.

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:31.566 A:middle
And when they do fail, they'll

00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:33.136 A:middle
abort, and they'll crash my app.

00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:34.006 A:middle
And again, that's a bad

00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:35.226 A:middle
experience for my customers.

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:37.526 A:middle
Let's take a look at how this

00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:37.976 A:middle
could happen.

00:10:38.986 --> 00:10:40.266 A:middle
So, here again is that sample

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:41.336 A:middle
API response.

00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:43.466 A:middle
And we'll take a look at the

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:44.466 A:middle
list of tags here.

00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:47.616 A:middle
And say that second tag in there

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:48.806 A:middle
is modified.

00:10:49.506 --> 00:10:50.966 A:middle
Instead of a string, we have a

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:51.346 A:middle
number.

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:52.796 A:middle
It's maliciously changed by a

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:54.146 A:middle
third-party, or maybe again due

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:55.206 A:middle
to regular data corruption.

00:10:55.206 --> 00:10:57.666 A:middle
We can't always tell.

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:59.836 A:middle
Downcasting this list of tags
