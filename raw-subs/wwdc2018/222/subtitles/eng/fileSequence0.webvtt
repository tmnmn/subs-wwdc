&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:30.976 A:middle
Thank you all for joining me,

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:32.256 A:middle
even before the coffee's kicked

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:32.466 A:middle
in.

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:34.696 A:middle
My name is Itai and I work on

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:35.456 A:middle
the foundation team.

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:37.556 A:middle
In this session, I'd like to

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.106 A:middle
talk to you about how the data

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:40.246 A:middle
that flows through your app can

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:41.916 A:middle
affect it, and how you can

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.336 A:middle
better protect your customers by

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:44.806 A:middle
building trust in that data.

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:46.526 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.696 A:middle
Apps don't live in a vacuum.

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:51.546 A:middle
In order for your apps to do

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:52.946 A:middle
something useful, they have to

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:54.286 A:middle
draw in data from external

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.686 A:middle
sources, like the disc, or the

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:56.846 A:middle
network, or your customers

00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:57.416 A:middle
themselves.

00:00:57.956 --> 00:00:59.156 A:middle
And then do something meaningful

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:00.656 A:middle
with that data, and then present
