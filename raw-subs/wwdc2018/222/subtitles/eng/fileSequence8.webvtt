00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:02.716 A:middle
app, my app makes a request to

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:03.256 A:middle
my server.

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.876 A:middle
Which requests a list of

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:06.986 A:middle
products that are currently

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.166 A:middle
available for sale to my friends

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:08.546 A:middle
and family.

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:11.156 A:middle
When the server receives this

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:12.636 A:middle
request, it responses with JSON,

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:13.986 A:middle
that indicates here are the

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:16.576 A:middle
products available to sell.

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:18.956 A:middle
Now, this is what an API

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:20.186 A:middle
response from my server might

00:08:20.186 --> 00:08:20.576 A:middle
look like.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:22.606 A:middle
It's an array of product

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:23.836 A:middle
listings, which have some

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.716 A:middle
interesting fields that you

00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:25.516 A:middle
might care to look at.

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:29.116 A:middle
For instance, each listing has a

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:29.986 A:middle
product ID.

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:31.776 A:middle
A positive integer that uniquely

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:32.686 A:middle
identifies the product.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:34.275 A:middle
And in my case, these are

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:35.986 A:middle
sequential integer IDs.

00:08:37.346 --> 00:08:38.905 A:middle
Every listing also has a name

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:39.706 A:middle
and a description which are

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:40.196 A:middle
strings.

00:08:40.196 --> 00:08:41.306 A:middle
And there are a few other type

00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:42.366 A:middle
fields here that we might care

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:42.756 A:middle
to look at.

00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:45.216 A:middle
For instance, there's a field

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:46.506 A:middle
that's a Boolean that indicates

00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:47.586 A:middle
whether or not this listing has

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:48.236 A:middle
already been sold.

00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:50.716 A:middle
And there's some internal

00:08:50.716 --> 00:08:51.386 A:middle
structure here.

00:08:51.476 --> 00:08:52.626 A:middle
This list of tags, which are

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:53.726 A:middle
strings, which we might care to

00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:54.066 A:middle
use.

00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:57.216 A:middle
There are also a few fields

00:08:57.216 --> 00:08:58.256 A:middle
here, which come to us as

00:08:58.256 --> 00:08:59.736 A:middle
strings, but really represent

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.026 A:middle
other forms of data that we
