00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:02.246 A:middle
When we make such a call,

00:23:02.636 --> 00:23:04.456 A:middle
NSKeyedUnarchiver, takes the

00:23:04.456 --> 00:23:06.606 A:middle
object that we used, this class,

00:23:07.056 --> 00:23:08.516 A:middle
and constructs an allowed class

00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:09.706 A:middle
list from it.

00:23:10.296 --> 00:23:12.626 A:middle
When we go ahead and decode an

00:23:12.626 --> 00:23:14.306 A:middle
object from an archive, it's

00:23:14.306 --> 00:23:16.016 A:middle
class is first checked against

00:23:16.016 --> 00:23:16.936 A:middle
the allowed class list.

00:23:17.286 --> 00:23:19.626 A:middle
And if it isn't present, the

00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:20.886 A:middle
decode call will be rejected.

00:23:21.556 --> 00:23:24.436 A:middle
Now, if the class of the object

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:25.906 A:middle
that we find in the archive is

00:23:25.906 --> 00:23:26.966 A:middle
in the allowed class list,

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:28.566 A:middle
there's a few checks that we

00:23:28.566 --> 00:23:29.196 A:middle
need to perform.

00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:31.726 A:middle
Specifically, we'll need to make

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:33.276 A:middle
sure that this class itself also

00:23:33.276 --> 00:23:34.596 A:middle
conforms to NSSecureCoding.

00:23:35.906 --> 00:23:37.666 A:middle
If it doesn't, we can't be sure

00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:38.896 A:middle
that it itself will be able to

00:23:38.896 --> 00:23:40.546 A:middle
further securely decode its own

00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:41.146 A:middle
contents.

00:23:41.496 --> 00:23:43.086 A:middle
And so, we can't safely decode

00:23:43.086 --> 00:23:43.996 A:middle
one of these objects.

00:23:44.996 --> 00:23:46.256 A:middle
In our case, the purchase class

00:23:46.316 --> 00:23:46.506 A:middle
will.

00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:47.976 A:middle
And so, it's safe to decode and

00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:48.706 A:middle
keep track of it.

00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:51.086 A:middle
Now, there's two other checks

00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:51.716 A:middle
that are related to

00:23:51.716 --> 00:23:52.856 A:middle
superclass-subclass

00:23:53.256 --> 00:23:54.006 A:middle
relationships.

00:23:54.576 --> 00:23:56.906 A:middle
If you have two classes, one of

00:23:56.906 --> 00:23:58.226 A:middle
which is a subclass of another,

00:23:58.586 --> 00:24:00.636 A:middle
both conforming to NSCoding, and
