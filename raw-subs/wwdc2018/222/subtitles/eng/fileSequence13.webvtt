00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:01.376 A:middle
due to somebody trying to cause

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:02.986 A:middle
overflow in my app.

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:04.426 A:middle
This is something you need to

00:13:04.426 --> 00:13:05.066 A:middle
watch out for.

00:13:07.026 --> 00:13:08.526 A:middle
Now similar to range validation

00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:09.486 A:middle
is length validation.

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:12.176 A:middle
Again, every product listing has

00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:12.786 A:middle
a description.

00:13:12.786 --> 00:13:14.466 A:middle
Does it make sense for that

00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:15.496 A:middle
description to be empty?

00:13:16.876 --> 00:13:18.096 A:middle
Well, in my case, I know that

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:19.456 A:middle
anytime I upload a product

00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:21.456 A:middle
listing, I'm always going to put

00:13:21.456 --> 00:13:22.206 A:middle
a description in there.

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:23.456 A:middle
So, in my case, no it doesn't

00:13:23.456 --> 00:13:26.266 A:middle
make sense for it to be empty.

00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:27.556 A:middle
But even if it's not empty, does

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:28.496 A:middle
it make sense for it to be the

00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:29.706 A:middle
full length and contents of

00:13:29.706 --> 00:13:30.516 A:middle
"Romeo and Juliet?"

00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:32.786 A:middle
Also no, it doesn't make sense.

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:34.326 A:middle
Something here's gone wrong and

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:37.596 A:middle
I need to look for that.

00:13:38.056 --> 00:13:39.166 A:middle
Now, there's additional forms of

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:40.166 A:middle
validation that we really do

00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:40.806 A:middle
care about here.

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:42.286 A:middle
Even if all of these fields are

00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:44.366 A:middle
right type, nullability, and fit

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:45.286 A:middle
within the range and length that

00:13:45.286 --> 00:13:47.266 A:middle
we expect, their values and

00:13:47.266 --> 00:13:48.596 A:middle
contents are also equally

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:48.986 A:middle
important.

00:13:50.136 --> 00:13:51.836 A:middle
Every product listing has a URL

00:13:51.836 --> 00:13:53.096 A:middle
that I can send a customer to

00:13:53.096 --> 00:13:54.346 A:middle
see more information about that

00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:54.986 A:middle
product listing.

00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:57.306 A:middle
This comes to me as a string,

00:13:57.866 --> 00:13:59.376 A:middle
but it actually has to contain a

00:13:59.376 --> 00:13:59.596 A:middle
URL.

00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:00.966 A:middle
Does it make sense for it to be
