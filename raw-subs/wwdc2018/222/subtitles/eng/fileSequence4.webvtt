00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:00.826 A:middle
Raw data is the least abstract

00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:01.846 A:middle
data that we're going to work

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:03.306 A:middle
with, and our own structured

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:04.386 A:middle
model types are the most

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:04.916 A:middle
abstract.

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:07.266 A:middle
So, our goal for today is to

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:08.736 A:middle
take that data as far along the

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:09.916 A:middle
spectrum as we can.

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:12.096 A:middle
Now, our apps can stop at any

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:13.256 A:middle
point, make use of the data,

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:14.156 A:middle
however, we see fit.

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:15.566 A:middle
But we really want to work with

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:16.846 A:middle
our own model types wherever

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:17.286 A:middle
possible.

00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:19.995 A:middle
Now, the goal for today is to

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:21.696 A:middle
not just go as far along the

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:23.076 A:middle
abstraction spectrum as we can,

00:04:23.316 --> 00:04:25.546 A:middle
but to build trust as we do so.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.516 A:middle
At every stage, the data is

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:28.716 A:middle
going to get more complicated,

00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:30.216 A:middle
and there's going to be more

00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:31.346 A:middle
that we need to validate about

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:31.413 A:middle
it.

00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:32.966 A:middle
But once we do that, there's

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:33.836 A:middle
also going to be more that we

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:35.696 A:middle
can trust about it.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:37.686 A:middle
Now, for our use case today,

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:38.596 A:middle
we're not really going to be

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:39.696 A:middle
talking about formatted data.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:41.626 A:middle
Very often it's just a stepping

00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:42.956 A:middle
stone between raw and primitive

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:43.916 A:middle
data, and you don't work with it

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.326 A:middle
directly.

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:47.606 A:middle
For instance, given raw data,

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.256 A:middle
foundations JSON serialization

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:50.256 A:middle
will give you primitive data

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:50.516 A:middle
back.

00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:52.276 A:middle
You don't see just the formatted

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:53.206 A:middle
date directly, and you won't

00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:54.766 A:middle
make use of it.

00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:56.066 A:middle
So, today we'll just be talking

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:57.676 A:middle
about raw, primitive, and

00:04:57.676 --> 00:04:58.256 A:middle
structured data.
