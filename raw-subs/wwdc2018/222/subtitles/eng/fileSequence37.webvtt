00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:00.476 A:middle
structure of those primitive

00:37:00.476 --> 00:37:02.006 A:middle
values, we made sure that it was

00:37:02.006 --> 00:37:03.346 A:middle
valid to work with them to turn

00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:05.026 A:middle
them into our own model types.

00:37:06.476 --> 00:37:07.966 A:middle
By validating the semantics and

00:37:07.966 --> 00:37:09.216 A:middle
relationships between those

00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:10.846 A:middle
model types, we made sure that

00:37:10.846 --> 00:37:12.166 A:middle
they were valid to work with and

00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:13.076 A:middle
that they were data we could

00:37:13.766 --> 00:37:13.946 A:middle
trust.

00:37:15.216 --> 00:37:16.746 A:middle
So, where to go from here?

00:37:18.116 --> 00:37:19.136 A:middle
Well, now that you know all of

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.346 A:middle
this, I encourage you to go and

00:37:20.346 --> 00:37:21.926 A:middle
look at your code and do just

00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:22.286 A:middle
this.

00:37:23.386 --> 00:37:26.426 A:middle
Validate data at every stage in

00:37:26.426 --> 00:37:27.476 A:middle
the lifecycle of that data.

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:29.406 A:middle
Check for types and nullability.

00:37:29.646 --> 00:37:30.916 A:middle
But more importantly, range, and

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.186 A:middle
length, and domain-specific

00:37:32.186 --> 00:37:32.926 A:middle
applications.

00:37:33.516 --> 00:37:35.956 A:middle
If you have NSCoding types,

00:37:36.246 --> 00:37:37.736 A:middle
audit those types and earn your

00:37:37.796 --> 00:37:38.816 A:middle
NSSecureCoding badge.

00:37:38.936 --> 00:37:40.186 A:middle
And don't just earn it, use it.

00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:41.786 A:middle
Turn on secure coding wherever

00:37:41.786 --> 00:37:42.146 A:middle
you can.

00:37:43.656 --> 00:37:45.596 A:middle
And lastly, for new data types,

00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:47.556 A:middle
adopt Codable where possible and

00:37:47.556 --> 00:37:48.826 A:middle
make sure to perform that

00:37:48.826 --> 00:37:49.456 A:middle
validation.

00:37:50.246 --> 00:37:51.556 A:middle
Make sure you're only ever

00:37:51.556 --> 00:37:53.826 A:middle
working with data you can trust.

00:37:54.936 --> 00:37:56.026 A:middle
For more information about

00:37:56.026 --> 00:37:57.926 A:middle
Codable, specifically, see last

00:37:57.926 --> 00:37:58.976 A:middle
year's talk about What's New in

00:37:58.976 --> 00:37:59.486 A:middle
Foundation.

00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:01.076 A:middle
But if you have more questions
