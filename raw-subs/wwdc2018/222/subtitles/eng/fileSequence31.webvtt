00:31:00.576 --> 00:31:02.266 A:middle
And lastly, conform to the

00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:03.976 A:middle
NSSecureCoding protocol instead

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:05.536 A:middle
to indicate to the runtime that

00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:06.506 A:middle
this is what we intended.

00:31:06.506 --> 00:31:07.846 A:middle
It really does support secure

00:31:07.846 --> 00:31:08.126 A:middle
coding.

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:11.526 A:middle
And after that, well,

00:31:12.146 --> 00:31:13.006 A:middle
congratulations.

00:31:13.006 --> 00:31:14.366 A:middle
We've earned our NSSecureCoding

00:31:14.366 --> 00:31:14.666 A:middle
badge.

00:31:15.026 --> 00:31:15.876 A:middle
Physical badge is sold

00:31:15.876 --> 00:31:16.276 A:middle
separately.

00:31:18.046 --> 00:31:20.606 A:middle
Now, we think it's so important

00:31:20.606 --> 00:31:21.856 A:middle
for you to earn your own

00:31:21.856 --> 00:31:23.276 A:middle
NSSecureCoding badges and use

00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:25.036 A:middle
them that this year, we've added

00:31:25.086 --> 00:31:26.776 A:middle
new API and NSKeyedUnarchiver to

00:31:26.776 --> 00:31:28.426 A:middle
make sure that NSSecureCoding is

00:31:28.426 --> 00:31:29.506 A:middle
done wherever possible.

00:31:31.276 --> 00:31:32.456 A:middle
This new initializer and

00:31:32.456 --> 00:31:33.936 A:middle
convenience methods, turns on

00:31:33.936 --> 00:31:35.746 A:middle
secure coding by default and

00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:37.126 A:middle
sets the default decoding

00:31:37.126 --> 00:31:38.516 A:middle
failure policy to set error in

00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:38.866 A:middle
return.

00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:40.236 A:middle
So, unless you change the

00:31:40.236 --> 00:31:41.536 A:middle
decoding failure policy on your

00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:42.576 A:middle
own, you don't have to worry

00:31:42.576 --> 00:31:43.736 A:middle
about exceptions in Swift.

00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
And indeed, the old initializer

00:31:47.316 --> 00:31:48.776 A:middle
and convenience methods are

00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.186 A:middle
deprecated in favor of these

00:31:50.186 --> 00:31:50.736 A:middle
versions.

00:31:50.956 --> 00:31:51.996 A:middle
So, we really want you to use

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:52.146 A:middle
them.

00:31:53.726 --> 00:31:55.106 A:middle
And similarly, we've introduced

00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:56.066 A:middle
the same APIs on

00:31:56.096 --> 00:31:58.066 A:middle
NSKeyedUnarchiver, to make it

00:31:58.066 --> 00:31:58.996 A:middle
easier for you to turn

00:31:58.996 --> 00:32:00.426 A:middle
SecureCoding on when archiving.
