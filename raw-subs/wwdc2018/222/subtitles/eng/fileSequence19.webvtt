00:18:59.226 --> 00:19:02.176 A:middle
When I want to load that data

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:03.736 A:middle
back, well I can do the same

00:19:03.736 --> 00:19:03.996 A:middle
thing.

00:19:03.996 --> 00:19:06.226 A:middle
I can get that raw data and then

00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:06.976 A:middle
pass it along to

00:19:06.976 --> 00:19:08.476 A:middle
KeyedUnarchiver, to get an

00:19:08.476 --> 00:19:10.786 A:middle
object back out.

00:19:11.436 --> 00:19:12.506 A:middle
Now, as we've said, at every

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.046 A:middle
point here, the data is getting

00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:14.856 A:middle
more complicated.

00:19:15.346 --> 00:19:16.426 A:middle
There might be more to validate

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:17.756 A:middle
about it before we can trust it,

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:18.466 A:middle
just as well.

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:20.466 A:middle
So, you might wonder, okay,

00:19:20.466 --> 00:19:21.226 A:middle
what's the catch here?

00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:22.596 A:middle
What else is there left to

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:22.986 A:middle
validate?

00:19:22.986 --> 00:19:25.486 A:middle
And this downcast, here is a

00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:25.986 A:middle
good hint.

00:19:26.646 --> 00:19:29.436 A:middle
Note that this downcast happens

00:19:29.686 --> 00:19:31.166 A:middle
after we've unarchived an

00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:31.566 A:middle
object.

00:19:32.636 --> 00:19:33.866 A:middle
How could this ever fail?

00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.076 A:middle
It's a good indicator that

00:19:36.076 --> 00:19:37.206 A:middle
something else might be going on

00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:37.326 A:middle
here.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:40.696 A:middle
So, let's take a look at that.

00:19:40.696 --> 00:19:41.726 A:middle
This is an abstract

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:42.776 A:middle
representation of what these

00:19:42.776 --> 00:19:44.336 A:middle
model objects might look like in

00:19:44.336 --> 00:19:44.866 A:middle
my archive.

00:19:46.246 --> 00:19:47.706 A:middle
Here we have all the fields that

00:19:47.706 --> 00:19:48.666 A:middle
we cared about in coding.

00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:50.216 A:middle
And each of them contains their

00:19:50.216 --> 00:19:51.636 A:middle
own structure, and substructure,

00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:53.256 A:middle
and contents, and so on.

00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:55.846 A:middle
But, interestingly here this

00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:57.766 A:middle
representation also contains the

00:19:57.766 --> 00:19:59.576 A:middle
name of the class of this

00:19:59.576 --> 00:19:59.976 A:middle
object.
