alongside its caption.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.956 A:middle
For this quoted paragraph, we

00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:07.276 A:middle
use a blockquote element rather

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:08.166 A:middle
than a stylediv.

00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:10.096 A:middle
Reader automatically styles

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.336 A:middle
these blocksquote elements as

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:11.956 A:middle
appropriate.

00:07:14.616 --> 00:07:15.966 A:middle
Lastly, adding open graph

00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:17.656 A:middle
meta-tags gives more context to

00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:19.266 A:middle
Reader and also ensures that

00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:20.536 A:middle
links to the article look great

00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:21.106 A:middle
when shared.

00:07:23.246 --> 00:07:24.706 A:middle
For more information about open

00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:26.176 A:middle
graph meta-tags and rich links,

00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:28.096 A:middle
check out our video on Ensuring

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:29.306 A:middle
Beautiful Rich Links.

00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:32.906 A:middle
To recap this session, we've

00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:34.426 A:middle
seen how WebKit adapts existing

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:34.946 A:middle
content.

00:07:34.946 --> 00:07:36.746 A:middle
And we've also seen what you can

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:38.176 A:middle
do to optimize content for

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:39.306 A:middle
layout in Apple Watch.

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:41.296 A:middle
Finally, we covered best

00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:43.326 A:middle
practices for form controls and

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:44.936 A:middle
also learned how to ensure that

00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:46.496 A:middle
Reader brings out the key parts

00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:47.536 A:middle
of your web page.

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:51.016 A:middle
We're so excited to bring the

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:52.986 A:middle
power of the web to watchOS and

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:54.536 A:middle
can't wait to see what content

00:07:54.536 --> 00:07:55.936 A:middle
you create for Apple Watch.
