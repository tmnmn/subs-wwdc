00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:01.686 A:middle
Watch by using a media query to

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:03.476 A:middle
limit my two-column layout only

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.676 A:middle
to viewports larger than 320 CSS

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:06.196 A:middle
pixels.

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.146 A:middle
Now all I need to do is tell

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.776 A:middle
WebKit that this page is already

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:12.616 A:middle
optimized for Apple Watch and

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:13.556 A:middle
doesn't need the default

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:14.376 A:middle
adaptations.

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.636 A:middle
To do this, I simply include a

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:18.146 A:middle
new meta-tag in the head of my

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:20.086 A:middle
document with name equal to

00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:22.346 A:middle
disabled-adaptations and content

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:23.126 A:middle
equal to watch.

00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:25.456 A:middle
I'm using this new disabled

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.556 A:middle
adaptations meta-tag along side

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:29.026 A:middle
the existing viewport meta-tag

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.616 A:middle
I'm already using to ensure

00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:32.506 A:middle
responsive layout on iPhone and

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:33.776 A:middle
iPad.

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:35.246 A:middle
This allows WebKit to treat the

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
viewport's device width as the

00:04:36.706 --> 00:04:38.146 A:middle
real width of Apple Watch.

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:42.276 A:middle
Let's now switch gears and talk

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:43.616 A:middle
about some best practices for

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.446 A:middle
form controls.

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.866 A:middle
WebKit supports interaction with

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:48.376 A:middle
form controls out-of-the-box.

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:50.626 A:middle
To ensure a great experience for

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:51.836 A:middle
users when designing form

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:53.496 A:middle
controls and inputs, it's

00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:54.636 A:middle
important to keep a couple of

00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:55.476 A:middle
things in mind.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.386 A:middle
First, choose the appropriate

00:04:58.386 --> 00:04:59.886 A:middle
type attribute and element tag

00:04:59.886 --> 00:05:00.886 A:middle
for your form controls.
