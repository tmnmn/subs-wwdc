00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:01.466 A:middle
semantic markup to reinforce the

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.886 A:middle
meaning and purpose of elements

00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:03.686 A:middle
in the document.

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:05.756 A:middle
Let's walk through an example.

00:06:07.076 --> 00:06:08.936 A:middle
First, we indicate which parts

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:09.846 A:middle
of the page are the most

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:11.166 A:middle
important by wrapping it in an

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:11.866 A:middle
article tag.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.166 A:middle
Specifically, enclosing these

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.306 A:middle
header elements inside the

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:16.886 A:middle
article ensure that they all

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:17.686 A:middle
appear in Reader.

00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:20.776 A:middle
Reader also styles each header

00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:22.316 A:middle
element differently depending on

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.546 A:middle
the value of its itemprop

00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:24.236 A:middle
attribute.

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.476 A:middle
Using itemprop, we're able to

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:27.596 A:middle
ensure that the author,

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.466 A:middle
publication date, title, and

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:30.786 A:middle
subheading are prominently

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:31.216 A:middle
featured.

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.146 A:middle
This paragraph contains content

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.596 A:middle
that is of strong importance and

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:38.426 A:middle
other content that is

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:41.046 A:middle
emphasized, so we put this text

00:06:41.206 --> 00:06:42.896 A:middle
under strong and em elements.

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:45.226 A:middle
Reader recognizes these tags and

00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:46.806 A:middle
preserves their semantic styles.

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:52.726 A:middle
For this image, we use figure

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:54.146 A:middle
and figcaption elements to let

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:55.386 A:middle
the Reader know that the image

00:06:55.386 --> 00:06:56.566 A:middle
is associated with the below

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:57.056 A:middle
caption.

00:06:57.826 --> 00:06:59.306 A:middle
Reader then positions the image

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:00.486 A:middle
alongside its caption.
