00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.566 A:middle
Double tapping zooms into the

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.256 A:middle
page and a subsequent double tab

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.376 A:middle
zooms back out.

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.676 A:middle
Lastly, a firm press reveals

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
back and forward buttons, but

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.795 A:middle
you can also swipe forwards or

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:12.036 A:middle
backwards to navigate through

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:12.646 A:middle
your history.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.986 A:middle
It's important to note that we

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:16.276 A:middle
optimized WebKit for quickly

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:17.286 A:middle
consuming content.

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:19.106 A:middle
Therefore, a limited set of

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.396 A:middle
features are not supported at

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:20.966 A:middle
this time.

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:23.206 A:middle
These include video playback,

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.006 A:middle
service workers, and web fonts.

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:27.906 A:middle
Now let's see how WebKit lays

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:29.616 A:middle
out web pages on Apple Watch.

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:33.436 A:middle
Most responsive content is

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:34.786 A:middle
already well proportioned when

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:37.206 A:middle
laid out at 320 CSS pixels, the

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:38.516 A:middle
width of iPhone SE.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.146 A:middle
We ensure that it's also

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:42.626 A:middle
well-proportioned on Apple Watch

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.196 A:middle
by laying out at this width and

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.766 A:middle
then computing the initial scale

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.056 A:middle
of the page such that the

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:48.396 A:middle
content width fits within the

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:48.976 A:middle
viewport.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.206 A:middle
This means that text and images

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.636 A:middle
may appear smaller but the

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:54.046 A:middle
overall layout of the page is

00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:54.626 A:middle
preserved.

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.216 A:middle
When this technique is used, the

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:00.056 A:middle
viewport meta-tags initial scale
