00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to designing web

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:22.606 A:middle
content for watchOS.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.366 A:middle
My name is Wenson and I'm on the

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.066 A:middle
WebKit team.

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:27.586 A:middle
In watchOS 5, we're introducing

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.546 A:middle
the ability to render rich HTML

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:31.176 A:middle
content on Apple Watch using

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:31.676 A:middle
WebKit.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.016 A:middle
Before we explore how it works,

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:35.586 A:middle
let's go over a couple of the

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:37.296 A:middle
ways WebKit enriches the user

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:38.876 A:middle
experience on watchOS.

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:43.206 A:middle
Previously in mail, rich HTML

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.646 A:middle
mail messages would be rendered

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.786 A:middle
in a text-only format requiring

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:48.366 A:middle
the user to go to another device

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.506 A:middle
for the full experience.

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.936 A:middle
New in watchOS 5, the full HTML

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:54.326 A:middle
mail message can now render on

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.936 A:middle
Apple Watch in cases where

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:57.586 A:middle
text-only formatting cannot

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.066 A:middle
express the full content of the

00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.566 A:middle
message.
