00:39:59.776 --> 00:40:01.476 A:middle
size parameter to a order soup

00:40:01.476 --> 00:40:03.206 A:middle
intent, it might make sense to

00:40:03.206 --> 00:40:04.546 A:middle
make that an enum, since the

00:40:04.546 --> 00:40:06.036 A:middle
possible sizes are probably just

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:07.986 A:middle
small, medium, and large.

00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:11.016 A:middle
Using an enum will lead to

00:40:11.016 --> 00:40:12.956 A:middle
better suggestions and clearer

00:40:12.956 --> 00:40:14.286 A:middle
titles and subtitles for your

00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:14.806 A:middle
users.

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.176 A:middle
To learn more about how enums

00:40:17.176 --> 00:40:18.716 A:middle
are used to generate titles and

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.296 A:middle
subtitles, I recommend that you

00:40:20.296 --> 00:40:21.706 A:middle
watch the localization session.

00:40:22.206 --> 00:40:25.076 A:middle
Another type you can use is the

00:40:25.076 --> 00:40:25.736 A:middle
custom type.

00:40:27.116 --> 00:40:28.556 A:middle
Using a custom type will result

00:40:28.556 --> 00:40:29.836 A:middle
in an INObject and your

00:40:29.836 --> 00:40:31.116 A:middle
generated intent code.

00:40:32.156 --> 00:40:33.426 A:middle
An INObject combines an

00:40:33.426 --> 00:40:35.206 A:middle
identifier with a display

00:40:35.206 --> 00:40:35.516 A:middle
string.

00:40:36.336 --> 00:40:38.566 A:middle
The identifier can be used to

00:40:38.566 --> 00:40:40.086 A:middle
refer to an object internal to

00:40:40.086 --> 00:40:42.066 A:middle
your app, while the display

00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:43.126 A:middle
string contains the user

00:40:43.126 --> 00:40:44.626 A:middle
readable representation of that

00:40:44.626 --> 00:40:45.066 A:middle
object.

00:40:45.946 --> 00:40:47.516 A:middle
That way both your users and

00:40:47.516 --> 00:40:49.306 A:middle
your app always understands what

00:40:49.496 --> 00:40:50.856 A:middle
the value of this parameter is.

00:40:52.196 --> 00:40:54.666 A:middle
Finally, using an INObject also

00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:56.096 A:middle
prevents the possible dependency

00:40:56.096 --> 00:40:56.966 A:middle
between parameters.

00:40:57.676 --> 00:40:59.866 A:middle
Let me illustrate that.
