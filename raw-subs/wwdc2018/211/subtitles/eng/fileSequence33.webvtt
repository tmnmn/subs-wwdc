00:32:59.906 --> 00:33:01.396 A:middle
other things, the time of day

00:33:01.736 --> 00:33:02.656 A:middle
and the day of the week.

00:33:03.256 --> 00:33:04.946 A:middle
Well, for the location, we look

00:33:04.946 --> 00:33:06.216 A:middle
at the overall location of the

00:33:06.216 --> 00:33:07.286 A:middle
user and see if it's a

00:33:07.286 --> 00:33:08.736 A:middle
significant location for that

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:09.046 A:middle
user.

00:33:09.646 --> 00:33:12.776 A:middle
Let's see how the system now

00:33:12.776 --> 00:33:14.566 A:middle
uses these to make a suggestion.

00:33:16.016 --> 00:33:17.736 A:middle
Here, we'll just consider the

00:33:18.436 --> 00:33:18.526 A:middle
time.

00:33:19.216 --> 00:33:20.786 A:middle
Monday, at lunch, I order a

00:33:20.786 --> 00:33:22.506 A:middle
tomato soup with croutons.

00:33:23.766 --> 00:33:25.106 A:middle
That evening, I don't feel like

00:33:25.106 --> 00:33:26.516 A:middle
croutons, so I order a tomato

00:33:26.566 --> 00:33:27.516 A:middle
with red pepper instead.

00:33:27.516 --> 00:33:30.866 A:middle
Next day at lunch, I, again,

00:33:30.866 --> 00:33:32.016 A:middle
order a tomato soup with

00:33:32.016 --> 00:33:32.466 A:middle
croutons.

00:33:33.326 --> 00:33:34.686 A:middle
I keep doing this throughout the

00:33:34.686 --> 00:33:36.966 A:middle
week, and, on Friday, at lunch,

00:33:37.246 --> 00:33:38.156 A:middle
Siri might try to find a

00:33:38.156 --> 00:33:38.926 A:middle
suggestion for me.

00:33:39.806 --> 00:33:41.926 A:middle
It will look at my past behavior

00:33:41.926 --> 00:33:43.286 A:middle
and try to find a pattern in it.

00:33:43.806 --> 00:33:45.286 A:middle
And since it's lunchtime, and I

00:33:45.286 --> 00:33:46.546 A:middle
usually order a tomato soup with

00:33:46.666 --> 00:33:48.486 A:middle
croutons at lunchtime, Siri

00:33:48.566 --> 00:33:50.486 A:middle
might notice this and suggest

00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:51.986 A:middle
this to me, which is great.

00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:53.096 A:middle
It's exactly what I wanted.

00:33:54.546 --> 00:33:56.196 A:middle
So, this is all pretty high

00:33:56.196 --> 00:33:57.546 A:middle
level, so let's take a look at

00:33:57.546 --> 00:33:59.526 A:middle
how it actually works, starting

00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:00.886 A:middle
with NSUserActivity.
