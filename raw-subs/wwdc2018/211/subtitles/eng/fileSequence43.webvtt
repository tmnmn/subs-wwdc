00:42:59.086 --> 00:43:00.086 A:middle
at a couple of privacy

00:43:00.086 --> 00:43:01.776 A:middle
considerations and how you can

00:43:01.776 --> 00:43:03.236 A:middle
make sure your user are never

00:43:03.236 --> 00:43:04.816 A:middle
upset by what is suggested to

00:43:04.816 --> 00:43:04.966 A:middle
them.

00:43:08.046 --> 00:43:09.426 A:middle
Your users expect that when they

00:43:09.426 --> 00:43:10.626 A:middle
delete something from within

00:43:10.626 --> 00:43:12.046 A:middle
your app that it's deleted for

00:43:12.046 --> 00:43:12.286 A:middle
good.

00:43:12.946 --> 00:43:15.706 A:middle
It's important to honor this so

00:43:15.706 --> 00:43:17.066 A:middle
you maintain your users' trust

00:43:17.146 --> 00:43:18.626 A:middle
and your so users aren't

00:43:18.626 --> 00:43:20.176 A:middle
presented with suggestions for

00:43:20.176 --> 00:43:21.296 A:middle
things that are not relevant to

00:43:21.296 --> 00:43:21.946 A:middle
them anymore.

00:43:22.986 --> 00:43:25.076 A:middle
So, if you donate shortcuts that

00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:26.606 A:middle
contain information that the

00:43:26.606 --> 00:43:28.106 A:middle
user can delete, you should make

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:29.596 A:middle
sure to delete those donations

00:43:29.716 --> 00:43:31.506 A:middle
at the appropriate time.

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.246 A:middle
Let's take a look at how to

00:43:33.246 --> 00:43:35.226 A:middle
delete donations, starting with

00:43:35.226 --> 00:43:36.016 A:middle
NSUserActivity.

00:43:39.376 --> 00:43:41.506 A:middle
There are two ways to delete a

00:43:41.506 --> 00:43:42.696 A:middle
donated user activity.

00:43:43.766 --> 00:43:45.276 A:middle
If you use Spotlight indexing

00:43:45.396 --> 00:43:46.286 A:middle
and you set the

00:43:46.286 --> 00:43:48.206 A:middle
relatedUniqueIdentifier, then

00:43:48.206 --> 00:43:49.256 A:middle
deleting the content from

00:43:49.256 --> 00:43:50.616 A:middle
Spotlight will automatically

00:43:50.616 --> 00:43:51.786 A:middle
delete the donated user

00:43:51.786 --> 00:43:52.346 A:middle
activity.

00:43:53.966 --> 00:43:54.436 A:middle
Just set the

00:43:54.436 --> 00:43:56.056 A:middle
relatedUniqueIdentifier on the

00:43:56.056 --> 00:43:57.706 A:middle
contentAttributeSet to the

00:43:57.706 --> 00:43:59.056 A:middle
identifier of the searchable

00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:00.476 A:middle
item that it matches with.
