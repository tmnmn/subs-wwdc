00:18:59.376 --> 00:19:01.266 A:middle
Now, the really cool thing about

00:19:01.386 --> 00:19:02.546 A:middle
INRelevantShortcut is that it

00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:03.926 A:middle
works even if you don't have a

00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:04.406 A:middle
Watch app.

00:19:04.806 --> 00:19:06.206 A:middle
So, you can actually expose

00:19:06.206 --> 00:19:07.896 A:middle
relevant shortcuts from your iOS

00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:09.126 A:middle
apps, and if they run in the

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:10.666 A:middle
background, they'll appear right

00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:11.776 A:middle
on the Siri Watch Face.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.656 A:middle
Okay, now that we've explored

00:19:13.656 --> 00:19:14.946 A:middle
all the ways that Shortcuts can

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.256 A:middle
be used and how to adopt the

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.586 A:middle
APIs, I'm going to turn it over

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:20.146 A:middle
to my colleague Willem who's

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:21.326 A:middle
going to give you a great demo

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:23.026 A:middle
of how to adopt shortcuts in

00:19:23.026 --> 00:19:23.486 A:middle
Xcode.

00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:24.976 A:middle
Willem?

00:19:25.516 --> 00:19:34.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:35.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ari.

00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:38.976 A:middle
I'm so excited to be the first

00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:42.056 A:middle
one to demo adopting Shortcuts.

00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:45.606 A:middle
Before I dive into Xcode, let me

00:19:45.606 --> 00:19:46.536 A:middle
show you the app we've been

00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:47.066 A:middle
working on.

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.786 A:middle
As Ari mentioned, we've been

00:19:48.786 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
working on a soup-ordering app

00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:51.306 A:middle
called Soup Chef.

00:19:51.486 --> 00:19:52.916 A:middle
Let me show it to you.

00:19:59.356 --> 00:20:01.176 A:middle
So, this is Soup Chef.
