00:02:58.686 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
Apple Watch, and even on

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:01.686 A:middle
HomePod.

00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:04.956 A:middle
So, we also have the new

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:06.576 A:middle
Shortcuts app, and with the new

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:08.146 A:middle
Shortcuts app, anyone can build

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.176 A:middle
their own shortcuts, and you do

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.086 A:middle
it just by dragging and dropping

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:13.396 A:middle
a series of steps together.

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:15.556 A:middle
And those steps can even include

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.406 A:middle
the shortcuts exposed by your

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:19.046 A:middle
app.

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:21.476 A:middle
So, today, we're going to talk

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:23.096 A:middle
about how to adopt shortcuts for

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:24.606 A:middle
your apps, and then we'll talk

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:25.676 A:middle
about how to optimize your

00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:27.346 A:middle
shortcuts for great suggestions.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.316 A:middle
And we'll also cover some

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:30.926 A:middle
privacy considerations that are

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.106 A:middle
important to keep in mind, and

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:33.036 A:middle
we'll talk about how to make

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:34.486 A:middle
great shortcuts for media

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:34.906 A:middle
playback.

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:38.156 A:middle
So, first, we'll talk about how

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:39.656 A:middle
to adopt the new Shortcut's

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:39.946 A:middle
APIs.

00:03:41.546 --> 00:03:43.236 A:middle
There were three steps for

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:44.676 A:middle
creating a shortcut, and the

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:46.286 A:middle
first step is to define your

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:46.726 A:middle
shortcut.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:48.256 A:middle
That means you have to decide

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:50.186 A:middle
what you want to expose as a

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:52.336 A:middle
shortcut and define each one so

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:53.576 A:middle
Siri knows everything that your

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:54.136 A:middle
app can do.

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:57.076 A:middle
Next, you'll need to donate your

00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:57.676 A:middle
new shortcut.

00:03:58.086 --> 00:03:59.436 A:middle
That means you need to tell the

00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:01.816 A:middle
system every time the user does
