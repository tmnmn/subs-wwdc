00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:01.336 A:middle
the values for your parameters.

00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:04.246 A:middle
So, if your shortcut can't be

00:13:04.246 --> 00:13:05.526 A:middle
performed in the background

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:06.916 A:middle
because it needs to launch your

00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:08.326 A:middle
app when you use it, you should

00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:10.446 A:middle
uncheck the Supports background

00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:11.766 A:middle
execution checkbox.

00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:14.566 A:middle
Now, in some cases, one intent

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:15.786 A:middle
may have multiple shortcut

00:13:15.786 --> 00:13:17.166 A:middle
types, where some support

00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:18.786 A:middle
background execution and some

00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:19.026 A:middle
don't.

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:21.666 A:middle
Now, in the case of Soup Chef,

00:13:21.826 --> 00:13:22.996 A:middle
that's especially relevant,

00:13:22.996 --> 00:13:24.276 A:middle
because we can support

00:13:24.276 --> 00:13:26.186 A:middle
background execution when both

00:13:26.186 --> 00:13:28.286 A:middle
the items and delivery location

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:29.586 A:middle
are predicted, because we have

00:13:29.586 --> 00:13:30.926 A:middle
all we need to place an order.

00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:33.276 A:middle
But if we add a shortcut type

00:13:33.496 --> 00:13:37.106 A:middle
that only includes delivery

00:13:37.106 --> 00:13:39.186 A:middle
location, Siri may predict that,

00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:40.236 A:middle
and we won't actually have

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.226 A:middle
enough information to place an

00:13:41.226 --> 00:13:41.446 A:middle
order.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.926 A:middle
So, we'll need our app to open

00:13:42.926 --> 00:13:44.806 A:middle
to ask the user what location to

00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:46.176 A:middle
deliver to, and, in that case,

00:13:46.176 --> 00:13:47.466 A:middle
we'll want to not support

00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:49.056 A:middle
background execution for that

00:13:49.056 --> 00:13:50.846 A:middle
shortcut type.

00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:52.736 A:middle
Now, you should specify shortcut

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:54.676 A:middle
types for every variation of

00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:55.896 A:middle
your shortcut that you think

00:13:55.896 --> 00:13:57.366 A:middle
will be useful so that Siri can

00:13:57.366 --> 00:13:58.496 A:middle
make the best predictions.

00:13:58.946 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
And, for the best experience,
