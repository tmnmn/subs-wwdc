00:13:58.946 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
And, for the best experience,

00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:02.366 A:middle
you should-- on all the shortcut

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:03.506 A:middle
types, you can-- support

00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:04.496 A:middle
background execution.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.686 A:middle
Shortcut types that support

00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:08.226 A:middle
background execution provide

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:09.756 A:middle
more acceleration to the user,

00:14:09.756 --> 00:14:10.716 A:middle
and so they'll actually be

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.056 A:middle
suggested more frequently.

00:14:13.726 --> 00:14:15.336 A:middle
You can provide up to 16

00:14:15.336 --> 00:14:16.826 A:middle
shortcut types for every intent

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:17.446 A:middle
that you define.

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:19.946 A:middle
Now, once your intent is

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:21.696 A:middle
defined, Xcode will

00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:23.446 A:middle
automatically code generate an

00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:25.596 A:middle
intent class and an intent

00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:26.906 A:middle
handling protocol.

00:14:27.236 --> 00:14:29.176 A:middle
In my case, we've generated the

00:14:29.176 --> 00:14:31.666 A:middle
OrderSoupIntent class and an

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.666 A:middle
OrderSoupIntentHandling protocol

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:36.116 A:middle
with properties that correspond

00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:37.616 A:middle
to what I just defined in my

00:14:37.616 --> 00:14:39.146 A:middle
intent definition file.

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.386 A:middle
Because Xcode is doing code

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:42.396 A:middle
generation, it's really

00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:44.316 A:middle
important to consider in which

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:45.886 A:middle
targets Xcode is doing this code

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:47.486 A:middle
generation, because you don't

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:48.796 A:middle
want to end up with duplicate

00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:50.586 A:middle
instances of the same classes

00:14:50.586 --> 00:14:51.576 A:middle
that conflict with each other.

00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:55.026 A:middle
So, let's look at the targets in

00:14:55.156 --> 00:14:56.706 A:middle
the target membership section of

00:14:56.736 --> 00:14:58.156 A:middle
the inspector on my intent

00:14:58.156 --> 00:14:58.876 A:middle
definition file.
