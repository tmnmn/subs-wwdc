00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.426 A:middle
your app, and it integrates with

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:02.776 A:middle
other Apple features like

00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:04.156 A:middle
Spotlight and Handoff.

00:06:05.046 --> 00:06:07.046 A:middle
And the second is intents.

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:08.676 A:middle
Intents are a way of

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.726 A:middle
representing, in detail, a type

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:12.286 A:middle
of action that your app can

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:14.726 A:middle
perform, and Siri includes a

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:18.166 A:middle
bunch of great built-in intents

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:19.106 A:middle
that support a range of

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.786 A:middle
capabilities that apps can use

00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:21.716 A:middle
to integrate with Siri.

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:22.916 A:middle
And, this year, we're

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:23.896 A:middle
introducing something really

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:25.176 A:middle
cool, which is the ability for

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.556 A:middle
you to define your own custom

00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:27.886 A:middle
intents for use with Shortcuts.

00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:30.676 A:middle
So, for every shortcut you

00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:32.286 A:middle
expose, you'll need to decide

00:06:32.286 --> 00:06:33.126 A:middle
whether it should be an

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.836 A:middle
NSUserActivity or an intent.

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.836 A:middle
So, let's talk about how to make

00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:39.266 A:middle
that decision.

00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:42.426 A:middle
Now, NSUserActivity is a great

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:43.606 A:middle
choice for building a shortcut.

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.366 A:middle
If you're just building a simple

00:06:45.366 --> 00:06:46.746 A:middle
shortcut that opens something in

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:49.186 A:middle
your app, or if you're exposing

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:51.496 A:middle
a shortcut for something that

00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:53.216 A:middle
you already index in Spotlight

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.386 A:middle
search, or that you already

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:57.486 A:middle
offer in NSUserActivity for, for

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:58.616 A:middle
example, for Handoff.

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:02.436 A:middle
But for the best Shortcuts
