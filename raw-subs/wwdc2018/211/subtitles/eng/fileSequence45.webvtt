00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:00.586 A:middle
through INInteraction.

00:45:01.496 --> 00:45:03.816 A:middle
An INInteraction has an

00:45:03.856 --> 00:45:04.916 A:middle
identifier and a group

00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:06.386 A:middle
identifier property that you can

00:45:06.386 --> 00:45:08.086 A:middle
set and then later use to delete

00:45:08.086 --> 00:45:09.366 A:middle
one or more donated

00:45:09.366 --> 00:45:10.086 A:middle
interactions.

00:45:10.556 --> 00:45:13.986 A:middle
Just set the identifier and or

00:45:13.986 --> 00:45:15.806 A:middle
group identifier before donating

00:45:15.806 --> 00:45:16.546 A:middle
the interaction.

00:45:17.586 --> 00:45:18.676 A:middle
Then, when you want to delete

00:45:18.676 --> 00:45:20.616 A:middle
it, you call delete with an

00:45:20.616 --> 00:45:22.286 A:middle
array of the identifiers that

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:22.866 A:middle
you want to delete.

00:45:23.706 --> 00:45:25.426 A:middle
You can also delete all donated

00:45:25.426 --> 00:45:27.076 A:middle
intents with a shared group

00:45:27.076 --> 00:45:28.836 A:middle
identifier by calling delete

00:45:29.066 --> 00:45:30.176 A:middle
with the group identifier.

00:45:30.266 --> 00:45:33.386 A:middle
And, finally, just like

00:45:33.386 --> 00:45:34.796 A:middle
NSUserActivity, there is a way

00:45:34.796 --> 00:45:36.146 A:middle
to delete all your donated

00:45:36.146 --> 00:45:38.746 A:middle
intents by calling deleteAll on

00:45:38.746 --> 00:45:39.426 A:middle
INInteraction.

00:45:40.796 --> 00:45:42.766 A:middle
Please make sure to delete your

00:45:42.766 --> 00:45:44.136 A:middle
donations at the appropriate

00:45:44.136 --> 00:45:44.456 A:middle
time.

00:45:45.046 --> 00:45:46.016 A:middle
This will give your users the

00:45:46.016 --> 00:45:47.736 A:middle
best possible suggestions and

00:45:47.736 --> 00:45:48.976 A:middle
never make them wonder why

00:45:48.976 --> 00:45:49.986 A:middle
they're seeing suggestions for

00:45:49.986 --> 00:45:51.196 A:middle
things that are no longer

00:45:51.196 --> 00:45:53.976 A:middle
relevant to them.

00:45:55.326 --> 00:45:56.206 A:middle
So, now that we've looked at

00:45:56.206 --> 00:45:57.386 A:middle
different things to consider

00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.836 A:middle
when creating and donating

00:45:59.836 --> 00:46:02.386 A:middle
shortcuts, let's end by briefly
