00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:01.016 A:middle
viewController for the order

00:21:01.016 --> 00:21:01.626 A:middle
detail view.

00:21:02.776 --> 00:21:04.766 A:middle
I'm creating a user activity,

00:21:04.926 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
and I'm setting the

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:07.306 A:middle
requiredUserInfoKeys.

00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:08.966 A:middle
I'm also making sure that it's

00:21:08.966 --> 00:21:09.986 A:middle
EligibleForSearch.

00:21:11.316 --> 00:21:14.996 A:middle
For it to be suggested, I also

00:21:14.996 --> 00:21:16.146 A:middle
need to make it eligible for

00:21:16.146 --> 00:21:16.726 A:middle
prediction.

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:22.736 A:middle
And that's it.

00:21:23.326 --> 00:21:24.346 A:middle
Let's try it out.

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.236 A:middle
First, I need to make sure that

00:21:35.236 --> 00:21:36.766 A:middle
I donate the user activity, so

00:21:36.766 --> 00:21:39.656 A:middle
I'll go back to the view.

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:40.456 A:middle
That should be enough.

00:21:40.976 --> 00:21:42.366 A:middle
Now we want to make sure that

00:21:42.366 --> 00:21:43.696 A:middle
the donation actually happened,

00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:45.476 A:middle
and, to do that, we added two

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:47.116 A:middle
new developer settings that make

00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:48.916 A:middle
it super easy to see a recent

00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:50.726 A:middle
donations in search and on the

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:51.296 A:middle
lock screen.

00:21:51.826 --> 00:21:53.426 A:middle
To enable it, I go to Settings,

00:21:54.126 --> 00:21:55.216 A:middle
and I scroll down to the

00:21:55.216 --> 00:21:56.096 A:middle
developer section.

00:21:57.166 --> 00:21:59.136 A:middle
At the bottom, there are two new

00:21:59.136 --> 00:22:00.776 A:middle
toggles, Display Recent
