00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:01.816 A:middle
system every time the user does

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.476 A:middle
something in your app that you

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.046 A:middle
expose a shortcut for, which

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:06.776 A:middle
will let Siri learn when and

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:07.916 A:middle
where is the right time to

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:08.826 A:middle
suggest your shortcut.

00:04:09.246 --> 00:04:12.026 A:middle
And the third step is to handle

00:04:12.026 --> 00:04:12.616 A:middle
your shortcut.

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:14.936 A:middle
That means, when the user wants

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:16.625 A:middle
to go and use your shortcut in

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:18.106 A:middle
Siri, on the lock screen, in

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.886 A:middle
search, you need to be ready for

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:22.356 A:middle
your app or app extension to be

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:23.596 A:middle
invoked and be handed the

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.456 A:middle
shortcut to handle.

00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:29.236 A:middle
So, before you define shortcuts,

00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:30.496 A:middle
you'll need to decide what

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:31.946 A:middle
exactly it is that you want to

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:32.396 A:middle
expose.

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.176 A:middle
And you should start by thinking

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:36.256 A:middle
through what are the most

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:37.316 A:middle
important things that people

00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:38.436 A:middle
like to do with your apps?

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:39.716 A:middle
Because those are the things

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:40.826 A:middle
that you might want to consider

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:41.936 A:middle
exposing shortcuts for.

00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:44.796 A:middle
So, every shortcut that you

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:46.776 A:middle
expose should accelerate the

00:04:46.776 --> 00:04:48.686 A:middle
user, to perform a key function

00:04:48.716 --> 00:04:49.246 A:middle
of your app.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.176 A:middle
That means it should take

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:52.616 A:middle
something that the user already

00:04:52.616 --> 00:04:54.266 A:middle
wanted to do with your app and

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:55.866 A:middle
help them do it even faster.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.616 A:middle
The acceleration that you offer

00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:00.376 A:middle
should be substantial, so you
