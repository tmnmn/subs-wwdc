00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:04.386 A:middle
Let's enable both.

00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:08.236 A:middle
I can now go back to the home

00:22:08.236 --> 00:22:09.906 A:middle
screen and pull down to go to

00:22:09.906 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
search, and I see the donation

00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:12.356 A:middle
that I just did.

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:13.656 A:middle
Great.

00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:18.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:19.126 --> 00:22:20.496 A:middle
I can tap it, and the app is

00:22:20.496 --> 00:22:21.556 A:middle
launched with that user

00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:23.046 A:middle
activity, and I'm back to the

00:22:23.046 --> 00:22:24.856 A:middle
order that I was just donated.

00:22:25.586 --> 00:22:28.846 A:middle
Great. So, this is pretty good,

00:22:29.216 --> 00:22:30.516 A:middle
but I think we can do a lot

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:30.826 A:middle
more.

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:33.326 A:middle
Since the main capability of our

00:22:33.326 --> 00:22:34.856 A:middle
app is ordering soup, it would

00:22:34.856 --> 00:22:35.846 A:middle
be great if this could be

00:22:35.846 --> 00:22:37.556 A:middle
suggested to our users.

00:22:38.016 --> 00:22:39.426 A:middle
And I want users to be able to

00:22:39.426 --> 00:22:40.776 A:middle
do that without having to launch

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:41.086 A:middle
the app.

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.156 A:middle
So, I'll implement it using an

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:43.756 A:middle
intent.

00:22:44.506 --> 00:22:47.536 A:middle
There isn't a built-in soup

00:22:47.536 --> 00:22:51.196 A:middle
order intent, but now in iOS 12,

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:53.116 A:middle
I can create a custom intent, so

00:22:53.116 --> 00:22:54.026 A:middle
I'll do that.

00:22:55.826 --> 00:22:58.076 A:middle
And to start by creating an

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.896 A:middle
intent definition file, I'll go

00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:01.606 A:middle
to File, View.
