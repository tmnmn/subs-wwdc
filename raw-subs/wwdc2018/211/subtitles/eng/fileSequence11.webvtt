00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.076 A:middle
an intent for ordering a soup,

00:11:01.076 --> 00:11:01.956 A:middle
so I'm going to call it

00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:02.576 A:middle
OrderSoup.

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:06.266 A:middle
Then I want to fill out my

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:07.326 A:middle
intent's metadata.

00:11:07.806 --> 00:11:09.056 A:middle
So, let's look at that one step

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:09.526 A:middle
at a time.

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:12.316 A:middle
The first piece of metadata is

00:11:12.346 --> 00:11:14.936 A:middle
category and defining a category

00:11:15.346 --> 00:11:17.536 A:middle
helps Siri know how to talk

00:11:17.536 --> 00:11:19.176 A:middle
about your intent and how to

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:20.186 A:middle
display it in the UI.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:22.286 A:middle
So, for example, in this case,

00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:23.596 A:middle
I'm choosing the Order category,

00:11:23.596 --> 00:11:25.216 A:middle
and when I choose Order, Siri

00:11:25.216 --> 00:11:26.926 A:middle
will say something like, "Okay,

00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:28.126 A:middle
I ordered it," when I use it

00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:28.626 A:middle
with Siri.

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:29.926 A:middle
And it'll display a button

00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:31.536 A:middle
confirmation title like Order.

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:33.776 A:middle
So, we offer several different

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:34.816 A:middle
categories, and you should

00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:36.516 A:middle
choose the one that matches your

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:37.656 A:middle
intent's purpose the most

00:11:37.656 --> 00:11:38.006 A:middle
closely.

00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:40.956 A:middle
Next, you want to fill out your

00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:42.716 A:middle
intent's title and description,

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:44.416 A:middle
and that will be used in all the

00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.196 A:middle
places where people can discover

00:11:46.196 --> 00:11:47.256 A:middle
which shortcuts your app

00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:47.726 A:middle
supports.

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:49.876 A:middle
And then there's the User

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.586 A:middle
confirmation required checkbox,

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:53.666 A:middle
which determines whether or not

00:11:53.786 --> 00:11:55.046 A:middle
we'll ask the user for a

00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:56.906 A:middle
confirmation before using your

00:11:56.906 --> 00:11:57.346 A:middle
shortcut.

00:11:57.496 --> 00:11:58.686 A:middle
So, Siri might say something

00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:00.066 A:middle
like, "Are you ready to order
