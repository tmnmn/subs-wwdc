00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:02.966 A:middle
File, View, Target and select

00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:04.446 A:middle
the Intents Extension target.

00:28:05.676 --> 00:28:06.496 A:middle
I'll give it a name,

00:28:06.656 --> 00:28:09.826 A:middle
SoupChefIntents, and I click

00:28:09.826 --> 00:28:10.286 A:middle
Finish.

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:14.956 A:middle
Since I've added a new target

00:28:14.956 --> 00:28:17.316 A:middle
where I'll use the intents, I

00:28:17.316 --> 00:28:18.166 A:middle
need to make sure that the

00:28:18.166 --> 00:28:19.316 A:middle
intent definition file is

00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:20.386 A:middle
included in that target.

00:28:20.746 --> 00:28:21.906 A:middle
So, I go back to the intent

00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:23.956 A:middle
definition file and add it to

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.156 A:middle
that target.

00:28:25.716 --> 00:28:27.196 A:middle
Again, I don't want to generate

00:28:27.196 --> 00:28:28.226 A:middle
code in that target, so, in the

00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:29.656 A:middle
dropdown, I'll select No

00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:33.726 A:middle
generated classes.

00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:36.976 A:middle
I also want the extension to

00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:38.406 A:middle
have access to the same data as

00:28:38.406 --> 00:28:40.066 A:middle
the app, so I'll add it to the

00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:40.766 A:middle
same app group.

00:28:41.646 --> 00:28:43.316 A:middle
In the Project Settings, I

00:28:43.316 --> 00:28:47.276 A:middle
select the intents target and in

00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:49.146 A:middle
the capability step, I'll add it

00:28:49.316 --> 00:28:52.286 A:middle
to the same app group.

00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:53.886 A:middle
Great. Now, we're ready to

00:28:53.886 --> 00:28:55.226 A:middle
implement the intent handler

00:28:55.346 --> 00:28:56.556 A:middle
that was created with this

00:28:56.556 --> 00:28:56.916 A:middle
target.

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:01.626 A:middle
First, I'll import our shared
