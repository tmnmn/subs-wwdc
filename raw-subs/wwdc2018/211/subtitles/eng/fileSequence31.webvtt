00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.646 A:middle
will launch the app with the

00:31:00.646 --> 00:31:02.586 A:middle
shortcut, and, as I implemented

00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:03.686 A:middle
it, it shows the order view,

00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:05.176 A:middle
where I can customize the order.

00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:07.026 A:middle
So, I'll add cheese, too.

00:31:07.206 --> 00:31:07.576 A:middle
Who knows?

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:09.496 A:middle
And I'll place the order.

00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:14.396 A:middle
Great. Finally, let's add the

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:15.516 A:middle
shortcut to Siri.

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:19.156 A:middle
I'll go to Settings, and I

00:31:19.156 --> 00:31:20.896 A:middle
scroll up to the Siri and

00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:21.316 A:middle
search.

00:31:22.206 --> 00:31:23.496 A:middle
Here I can select the shortcut

00:31:23.496 --> 00:31:24.796 A:middle
that I want to add to Siri.

00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:26.856 A:middle
In this case, I'll add the order

00:31:26.856 --> 00:31:28.636 A:middle
one clam chowder with croutons.

00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:31.456 A:middle
When I tap the record button, I

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:32.626 A:middle
can say the phrase I want to

00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:35.026 A:middle
associate with the shortcut.

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:36.286 A:middle
Soup time.

00:31:37.446 --> 00:31:38.876 A:middle
Now, they got it.

00:31:39.516 --> 00:31:45.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:48.636 --> 00:31:50.296 A:middle
Let's take a step back and look

00:31:50.296 --> 00:31:51.516 A:middle
at what we just did.

00:31:51.946 --> 00:31:53.126 A:middle
We started by making an

00:31:53.126 --> 00:31:54.856 A:middle
NSUserActivity that was already

00:31:54.856 --> 00:31:56.536 A:middle
implemented in our app eligible

00:31:56.536 --> 00:31:57.226 A:middle
for prediction.

00:31:57.886 --> 00:31:59.256 A:middle
This allowed it to be suggested

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:00.706 A:middle
and is a really easy way to
