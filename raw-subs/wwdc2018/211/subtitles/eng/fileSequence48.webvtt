shortcuts app.

00:48:01.486 --> 00:48:03.316 A:middle
You can adopt shortcuts by using

00:48:03.316 --> 00:48:04.766 A:middle
NSUserActivity, which is a

00:48:04.766 --> 00:48:06.326 A:middle
really easy way to expose the

00:48:06.326 --> 00:48:07.346 A:middle
content of your app.

00:48:08.246 --> 00:48:11.526 A:middle
Or you can use intents which

00:48:11.526 --> 00:48:12.556 A:middle
provides you with a deeper

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.296 A:middle
integration in the system and

00:48:14.296 --> 00:48:15.416 A:middle
can unlock entirely new

00:48:15.416 --> 00:48:16.976 A:middle
experiences for your users.
