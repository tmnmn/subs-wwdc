00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:00.936 A:middle
ability to define custom intents

00:10:00.936 --> 00:10:01.916 A:middle
in Xcode for Shortcuts.

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:05.346 A:middle
And so if the shortcut that you

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:06.486 A:middle
want to build corresponds to one

00:10:06.486 --> 00:10:08.156 A:middle
of the default built-in SiriKit

00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:09.566 A:middle
intents, then you should adopt

00:10:09.566 --> 00:10:09.876 A:middle
that.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:11.726 A:middle
But, otherwise, you can define

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:12.136 A:middle
your own.

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:15.096 A:middle
And whether you want to define

00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:16.416 A:middle
your own or adopt an existing

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:18.046 A:middle
one to customize it, you want to

00:10:18.046 --> 00:10:19.566 A:middle
get started by creating an

00:10:19.566 --> 00:10:21.356 A:middle
intent definition file in Xcode.

00:10:21.786 --> 00:10:24.746 A:middle
So, believe it or not, in my

00:10:24.746 --> 00:10:25.896 A:middle
spare time, I've been working

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:26.956 A:middle
with a couple friends on a new

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:29.156 A:middle
app, and it's a soup delivery

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:31.026 A:middle
app, and it's called Soup Chef.

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:32.666 A:middle
It's the easiest way to order

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.646 A:middle
soup, and I'm really excited

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:35.946 A:middle
about the potential of hooking

00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:36.586 A:middle
it up to Siri.

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:38.586 A:middle
So, let's step through how to

00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:40.286 A:middle
use the new Intent Editor to

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:42.066 A:middle
build an intent for Soup Chef.

00:10:42.126 --> 00:10:43.426 A:middle
I'm going to start by going to

00:10:43.426 --> 00:10:45.646 A:middle
File, New File in Xcode, and

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.256 A:middle
I'll choose the SiriKit Intent

00:10:47.256 --> 00:10:48.196 A:middle
Definition File type.

00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
And then I'll see the new Intent

00:10:50.626 --> 00:10:51.176 A:middle
Editor.

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:52.986 A:middle
So, let's get started by

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.346 A:middle
clicking the plus button in the

00:10:54.346 --> 00:10:54.866 A:middle
bottom left.

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:58.146 A:middle
Next, I want to give my intent a

00:10:58.146 --> 00:10:58.486 A:middle
name.

00:10:58.756 --> 00:10:59.926 A:middle
And, so in this case, I'm making

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.076 A:middle
an intent for ordering a soup,
