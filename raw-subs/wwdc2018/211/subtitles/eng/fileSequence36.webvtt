00:35:59.306 --> 00:36:01.616 A:middle
it might be able to say, "An

00:36:01.616 --> 00:36:03.736 A:middle
NSUserActivity with soup tomato

00:36:03.986 --> 00:36:05.546 A:middle
and quantity 1 is a good

00:36:05.546 --> 00:36:07.056 A:middle
suggestion for this user."

00:36:08.096 --> 00:36:10.456 A:middle
So, as you just saw, it's really

00:36:10.456 --> 00:36:11.796 A:middle
important to specify the right

00:36:11.846 --> 00:36:13.606 A:middle
set of keys as being required.

00:36:13.606 --> 00:36:14.946 A:middle
Otherwise, your users might not

00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:16.306 A:middle
get any suggestions at all.

00:36:17.076 --> 00:36:18.696 A:middle
So, that's how it worked for

00:36:18.696 --> 00:36:19.476 A:middle
user activity.

00:36:20.826 --> 00:36:23.006 A:middle
Intents work similarly but offer

00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.416 A:middle
you a lot more flexibility.

00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:29.086 A:middle
The main signal for intents are

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:30.046 A:middle
the shortcut types that you

00:36:30.046 --> 00:36:30.456 A:middle
define.

00:36:31.866 --> 00:36:33.766 A:middle
Each shortcut type defines a

00:36:33.766 --> 00:36:35.166 A:middle
combination of parameters that

00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.306 A:middle
is valid for suggestion.

00:36:36.966 --> 00:36:39.036 A:middle
It's similar to the

00:36:39.276 --> 00:36:40.556 A:middle
requiredUserInfoKeys, but

00:36:40.556 --> 00:36:41.896 A:middle
instead of having just one set,

00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:43.056 A:middle
you can define multiple.

00:36:43.666 --> 00:36:46.286 A:middle
Let's apply this to our Soup

00:36:46.286 --> 00:36:48.466 A:middle
Chef app.

00:36:48.466 --> 00:36:49.526 A:middle
Earlier, I defined an

00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:51.046 A:middle
OrderSoupIntent with three

00:36:51.046 --> 00:36:53.246 A:middle
parameters, soup, quantity, and

00:36:53.246 --> 00:36:53.676 A:middle
options.

00:36:54.026 --> 00:36:55.566 A:middle
At the time, I only defined a

00:36:55.566 --> 00:36:56.606 A:middle
single shortcut type that

00:36:56.606 --> 00:36:57.426 A:middle
combined all of these

00:36:57.466 --> 00:36:59.536 A:middle
parameters, but, ideally, you

00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
would define more shortcut
