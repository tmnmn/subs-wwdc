00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:00.886 A:middle
with NSUserActivity.

00:34:01.196 --> 00:34:04.586 A:middle
Imagine a user activity for the

00:34:04.586 --> 00:34:06.346 A:middle
place order screen in Soup Chef.

00:34:06.676 --> 00:34:08.166 A:middle
The user info dictionary could

00:34:08.166 --> 00:34:09.926 A:middle
contain three keys, soup,

00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:11.985 A:middle
quantity, and scroll position.

00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:13.835 A:middle
The last one is there, so, in

00:34:13.835 --> 00:34:15.036 A:middle
Handoff, you can bring the user

00:34:15.036 --> 00:34:16.346 A:middle
back to the exact position they

00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:17.146 A:middle
were last in.

00:34:18.286 --> 00:34:20.246 A:middle
Let's take a look at how this

00:34:20.366 --> 00:34:22.156 A:middle
can be suggested to the user.

00:34:22.815 --> 00:34:25.916 A:middle
We start by donating a user

00:34:25.916 --> 00:34:27.596 A:middle
activity where the soup is

00:34:27.596 --> 00:34:29.716 A:middle
tomato, the quantity is 1, and

00:34:29.716 --> 00:34:30.926 A:middle
the scroll position is 79

00:34:30.926 --> 00:34:31.366 A:middle
points.

00:34:32.005 --> 00:34:34.076 A:middle
Next, we donate a similar user

00:34:34.076 --> 00:34:35.196 A:middle
activity, but now scroll

00:34:35.196 --> 00:34:36.686 A:middle
position is changed to 110

00:34:36.686 --> 00:34:37.005 A:middle
points.

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:40.335 A:middle
We keep doing this, and, at some

00:34:40.335 --> 00:34:41.536 A:middle
point, Siri will try to find a

00:34:41.536 --> 00:34:42.376 A:middle
suggestion again.

00:34:42.976 --> 00:34:46.206 A:middle
It will look at past behavior

00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:47.315 A:middle
and try to find a pattern of

00:34:47.406 --> 00:34:48.556 A:middle
equal user activities.

00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:51.126 A:middle
But since the scroll position is

00:34:51.176 --> 00:34:52.985 A:middle
so inconsistent over time, it

00:34:52.985 --> 00:34:54.196 A:middle
might not be able to find a

00:34:54.196 --> 00:34:54.806 A:middle
suggestion.

00:34:56.346 --> 00:34:58.326 A:middle
So, how can we fix this?

00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:00.966 A:middle
We can use the
