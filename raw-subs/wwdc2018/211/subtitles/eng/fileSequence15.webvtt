00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:02.676 A:middle
Your intent definition file

00:15:02.676 --> 00:15:04.276 A:middle
should be included in every

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:05.976 A:middle
target in which your intent is

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.496 A:middle
used, so you should check the

00:15:07.496 --> 00:15:10.096 A:middle
box under Target Membership.

00:15:10.506 --> 00:15:11.806 A:middle
But you'll want to make sure

00:15:11.806 --> 00:15:13.066 A:middle
that if you have a framework,

00:15:13.316 --> 00:15:15.096 A:middle
you don't do code generation in

00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:16.086 A:middle
multiple targets that are

00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:16.986 A:middle
included from each other.

00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:19.546 A:middle
So, if you have a framework, set

00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:21.886 A:middle
the target membership to only

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:23.516 A:middle
generate intent classes for that

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:25.036 A:middle
framework by choosing intent

00:15:25.036 --> 00:15:26.866 A:middle
classes and choosing no

00:15:26.866 --> 00:15:28.426 A:middle
generated classes for every

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:29.036 A:middle
other target.

00:15:29.636 --> 00:15:31.496 A:middle
But if you don't have any

00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:32.596 A:middle
frameworks in your app because

00:15:32.596 --> 00:15:33.896 A:middle
you haven't separated your app

00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:35.786 A:middle
into frameworks yet, you should

00:15:35.786 --> 00:15:37.326 A:middle
check the target for every

00:15:37.426 --> 00:15:38.486 A:middle
single target.

00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:41.796 A:middle
And that's how you define custom

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:42.926 A:middle
intents in Xcode.

00:15:44.296 --> 00:15:45.436 A:middle
Once you've defined your custom

00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:46.776 A:middle
intent, it's really easy to

00:15:46.776 --> 00:15:47.296 A:middle
donate it.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:48.886 A:middle
All you have to do is

00:15:48.886 --> 00:15:50.646 A:middle
instantiate your intent object

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:52.856 A:middle
and then populate its parameters

00:15:52.956 --> 00:15:54.606 A:middle
and create and donate an

00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:55.936 A:middle
INInteraction object.

00:15:56.816 --> 00:15:58.826 A:middle
Make sure to do this every time

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.596 A:middle
the user performs the equivalent
