00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:00.066 A:middle
like, "Are you ready to order

00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:01.226 A:middle
with Soup Chef?"

00:12:01.226 --> 00:12:02.536 A:middle
That's really great for my app,

00:12:02.536 --> 00:12:03.566 A:middle
because I want to make sure that

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:04.676 A:middle
people aren't accidentally

00:12:04.676 --> 00:12:05.296 A:middle
ordering soup [laughs].

00:12:07.756 --> 00:12:09.696 A:middle
So, then, you'll see the intense

00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:10.386 A:middle
parameters.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.856 A:middle
And these define all of the

00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:14.016 A:middle
parameters that are passed to

00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:14.716 A:middle
your shortcut.

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:16.546 A:middle
For example, in my case, I have

00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:17.416 A:middle
two parameters.

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:19.556 A:middle
They are the list of items being

00:12:19.556 --> 00:12:21.166 A:middle
ordered and the location to

00:12:21.166 --> 00:12:21.746 A:middle
deliver to.

00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:23.966 A:middle
Now, parameters support a short

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:25.206 A:middle
list of types, and those types

00:12:25.206 --> 00:12:26.966 A:middle
include things like string,

00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:29.606 A:middle
number, person, and location.

00:12:30.046 --> 00:12:31.236 A:middle
But if you're building a

00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:33.746 A:middle
parameter that represents an

00:12:33.746 --> 00:12:35.346 A:middle
object that's in your app that's

00:12:35.346 --> 00:12:36.706 A:middle
not on the short list of types

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:38.236 A:middle
then you can choose the custom

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:39.786 A:middle
type.

00:12:40.386 --> 00:12:41.116 A:middle
Once you've defined your

00:12:41.116 --> 00:12:42.146 A:middle
parameters, you'll want to look

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:43.186 A:middle
at shortcut types.

00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:46.016 A:middle
These define all of the types of

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.266 A:middle
shortcuts that you'd like to be

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.326 A:middle
suggested to the user.

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:51.566 A:middle
Each type includes a particular

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:53.436 A:middle
combination of parameters that

00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:55.836 A:middle
will be predicted, and formats

00:12:55.836 --> 00:12:57.336 A:middle
for how to display the title and

00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:59.476 A:middle
subtitle of each one, filling in

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:01.336 A:middle
the values for your parameters.
