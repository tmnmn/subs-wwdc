&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:32.566 A:middle
My name is Ari Weinstein, and

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.326 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:35.766 A:middle
along with Willem Mattelaer to

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.516 A:middle
tell you about Siri Shortcuts.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:41.496 A:middle
So, two years ago, we announced

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:43.096 A:middle
the first version of SiriKit,

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:44.966 A:middle
which enables your apps to work

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.566 A:middle
with Siri, and it has great

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.446 A:middle
domain-specific knowledge for

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:50.046 A:middle
things like sending messages,

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.586 A:middle
requesting rides, making

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:52.356 A:middle
payments, and more.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.116 A:middle
But we know that you want to do

00:00:55.116 --> 00:00:57.096 A:middle
even more with SiriKit, and so

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:58.656 A:middle
that's why, this year, we're so

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.166 A:middle
excited to announce Shortcuts.
