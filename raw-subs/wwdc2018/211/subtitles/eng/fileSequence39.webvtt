00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:01.946 A:middle
include a timestamp, since that

00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:03.726 A:middle
might not longer be relevant by

00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:04.846 A:middle
the time this donation would be

00:39:04.846 --> 00:39:05.426 A:middle
suggested.

00:39:06.576 --> 00:39:08.976 A:middle
For instance, a shortcut that

00:39:08.976 --> 00:39:09.766 A:middle
shows appointments for a

00:39:09.766 --> 00:39:11.396 A:middle
specific day is probably not

00:39:11.396 --> 00:39:12.926 A:middle
that useful, since, if you see

00:39:12.926 --> 00:39:14.586 A:middle
that the next day or later,

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:15.756 A:middle
you're probably no longer

00:39:15.756 --> 00:39:16.976 A:middle
interested in the meetings of

00:39:16.976 --> 00:39:18.026 A:middle
that specific day.

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.716 A:middle
A shortcut with a relative time,

00:39:20.716 --> 00:39:22.626 A:middle
however, is a lot more useful.

00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:27.646 A:middle
You should also make sure that

00:39:27.646 --> 00:39:29.636 A:middle
you donate exactly once for each

00:39:29.636 --> 00:39:31.416 A:middle
user action, even if that user

00:39:31.416 --> 00:39:33.036 A:middle
action involves multiple actions

00:39:33.036 --> 00:39:34.606 A:middle
inside your app.

00:39:35.236 --> 00:39:37.116 A:middle
Finally, selecting the correct

00:39:37.116 --> 00:39:38.536 A:middle
parameters of your intent is

00:39:38.536 --> 00:39:39.216 A:middle
also important.

00:39:39.646 --> 00:39:40.616 A:middle
So, let's take a look at two

00:39:40.616 --> 00:39:42.376 A:middle
possible types, starting with

00:39:42.376 --> 00:39:42.836 A:middle
enums.

00:39:43.556 --> 00:39:46.026 A:middle
You can define enums in your

00:39:46.026 --> 00:39:47.696 A:middle
intent definition file next to

00:39:47.696 --> 00:39:49.566 A:middle
your intents, and use it as the

00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:53.106 A:middle
types of your parameters.

00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:55.486 A:middle
We recommend that you use enums

00:39:55.546 --> 00:39:56.596 A:middle
whenever the values for a

00:39:56.596 --> 00:39:57.666 A:middle
parameter are bounded.

00:39:58.296 --> 00:39:59.776 A:middle
For instance, if you would add a

00:39:59.776 --> 00:40:01.476 A:middle
size parameter to a order soup
