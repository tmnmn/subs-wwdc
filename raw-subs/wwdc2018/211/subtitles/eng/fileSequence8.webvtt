00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:01.106 A:middle
So, there's one key new thing

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.066 A:middle
here, which is the

00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:04.056 A:middle
isEligibleForPrediction flag.

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:06.206 A:middle
Setting this on any user

00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:07.386 A:middle
activity turns it into a

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.236 A:middle
shortcut, and what's really cool

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:10.716 A:middle
is if you have an existing user

00:08:10.716 --> 00:08:12.286 A:middle
activity in your app, you just

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:14.796 A:middle
have to set this to true and

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:16.416 A:middle
that user activity will become a

00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:17.606 A:middle
shortcut automatically.

00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:19.926 A:middle
Now, note that the

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:21.826 A:middle
isEligibleForSearch flag has to

00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:22.906 A:middle
be true in order for

00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:24.956 A:middle
isEligibleForPrediction to have

00:08:24.956 --> 00:08:25.336 A:middle
an effect.

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:27.746 A:middle
And, by the way, you might also

00:08:27.746 --> 00:08:28.746 A:middle
want to consider the

00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:30.806 A:middle
isEligibleForHandoff flag, which

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:31.786 A:middle
defaults to true.

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:34.196 A:middle
So, by default, all of your user

00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.885 A:middle
activities will be able to be

00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:38.846 A:middle
handed off between devices.

00:08:38.926 --> 00:08:40.066 A:middle
Now, when you're creating your

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:41.166 A:middle
user activity, you want to make

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:42.426 A:middle
sure to include all of the

00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:44.246 A:middle
information in your user info

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:45.896 A:middle
dictionary that you'll need to

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:47.326 A:middle
restore the activity later on.

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:50.976 A:middle
And the last step is to mark

00:08:50.976 --> 00:08:52.306 A:middle
your activity current by

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:54.186 A:middle
attaching it to a UI

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.566 A:middle
viewController or a UI responder

00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:56.586 A:middle
object that's onscreen.

00:08:57.186 --> 00:09:00.476 A:middle
Now, the last step is to handle
