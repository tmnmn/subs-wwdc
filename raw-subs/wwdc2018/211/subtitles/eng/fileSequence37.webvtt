00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
would define more shortcut

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:01.876 A:middle
types, since that gives more

00:37:01.876 --> 00:37:03.356 A:middle
options to the system to find

00:37:03.356 --> 00:37:04.326 A:middle
patterns in your user's

00:37:04.366 --> 00:37:04.776 A:middle
behavior.

00:37:05.596 --> 00:37:07.066 A:middle
So, now I'll define three.

00:37:08.136 --> 00:37:09.456 A:middle
One shortcut type that combines

00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:10.966 A:middle
soup and quantity, one that

00:37:10.966 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
combines soup and options, and

00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:14.056 A:middle
one that combines all three

00:37:14.126 --> 00:37:14.596 A:middle
parameters.

00:37:15.786 --> 00:37:17.326 A:middle
Let's apply this to another

00:37:17.326 --> 00:37:17.806 A:middle
example.

00:37:19.426 --> 00:37:21.586 A:middle
Again, I start on Monday, at

00:37:21.586 --> 00:37:23.136 A:middle
lunch, by ordering a tomato soup

00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:23.926 A:middle
with croutons.

00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:26.796 A:middle
The Soup Chef app donates this

00:37:26.846 --> 00:37:28.836 A:middle
to the system, and the system

00:37:28.836 --> 00:37:29.966 A:middle
will split us up into all the

00:37:29.966 --> 00:37:31.556 A:middle
possible combinations based on

00:37:31.556 --> 00:37:33.806 A:middle
the shortcut types that I just

00:37:34.576 --> 00:37:35.396 A:middle
defined.

00:37:35.396 --> 00:37:36.926 A:middle
That evening, I order a tomato

00:37:36.926 --> 00:37:37.866 A:middle
soup with red pepper.

00:37:38.636 --> 00:37:40.696 A:middle
Again, it gets donated, and it

00:37:40.696 --> 00:37:41.866 A:middle
will be split up in all the

00:37:41.866 --> 00:37:42.746 A:middle
possible combinations.

00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:45.376 A:middle
Next day, at lunch, I order a

00:37:45.376 --> 00:37:46.786 A:middle
tomato soup with croutons.

00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:48.456 A:middle
It gets donated and split up.

00:37:48.456 --> 00:37:50.876 A:middle
I keep doing this throughout the

00:37:50.876 --> 00:37:52.406 A:middle
week, and, on Friday, at lunch,

00:37:52.626 --> 00:37:53.476 A:middle
Siri might try to find a

00:37:53.476 --> 00:37:53.996 A:middle
suggestion.

00:37:55.076 --> 00:37:56.616 A:middle
It might see that I often order

00:37:56.616 --> 00:37:57.876 A:middle
a single tomato soup.

00:37:59.106 --> 00:38:04.476 A:middle
But since it's lunchtime, it
