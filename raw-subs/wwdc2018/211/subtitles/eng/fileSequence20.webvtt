00:19:59.356 --> 00:20:01.176 A:middle
So, this is Soup Chef.

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:02.956 A:middle
When I launch the app, I'm

00:20:02.956 --> 00:20:04.646 A:middle
presented with my order history.

00:20:05.106 --> 00:20:06.216 A:middle
Since I haven't ordered anything

00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:07.536 A:middle
yet, this is still empty.

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:09.516 A:middle
I can place a new order by

00:20:09.516 --> 00:20:10.506 A:middle
tapping the plus button.

00:20:11.346 --> 00:20:12.696 A:middle
This presents me with the soup

00:20:12.696 --> 00:20:13.726 A:middle
menu, where you can see the

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.016 A:middle
available soups I can order.

00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:18.056 A:middle
Let's order a tomato soup.

00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:21.336 A:middle
Next, I can specify the quantity

00:20:21.336 --> 00:20:22.506 A:middle
and options for my soup.

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:24.586 A:middle
I'll order a single tomato soup

00:20:24.886 --> 00:20:26.816 A:middle
with red pepper, and when I'm

00:20:26.816 --> 00:20:28.446 A:middle
ready to order, I tap the Place

00:20:28.496 --> 00:20:29.056 A:middle
Order button.

00:20:30.306 --> 00:20:31.666 A:middle
I'm brought back to the order

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:32.586 A:middle
history where you can now see

00:20:32.586 --> 00:20:33.706 A:middle
the order that I just placed.

00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:36.316 A:middle
I can tap the order to see more

00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:37.846 A:middle
details about a specific order.

00:20:38.726 --> 00:20:40.236 A:middle
This view has an associated user

00:20:40.236 --> 00:20:40.776 A:middle
activity.

00:20:41.036 --> 00:20:43.576 A:middle
I think it would be pretty cool

00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:45.196 A:middle
to suggest this to our users,

00:20:45.496 --> 00:20:46.586 A:middle
since our users like to

00:20:46.586 --> 00:20:47.976 A:middle
reminisce about the good soups

00:20:47.976 --> 00:20:49.166 A:middle
they've ordered in the past

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.066 A:middle
[laughter].

00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:52.206 A:middle
And it would be great if this

00:20:52.206 --> 00:20:53.206 A:middle
could be suggested to them.

00:20:53.726 --> 00:20:54.866 A:middle
So, let's go to Xcode and see

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:57.346 A:middle
how we can do that.

00:20:58.276 --> 00:20:59.596 A:middle
Here, I'm looking at the

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:01.016 A:middle
viewController for the order
