00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:00.966 A:middle
We can use the

00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:02.366 A:middle
requiredUserInfoKeys.

00:35:03.486 --> 00:35:05.046 A:middle
RequiredUserInfoKeys is an

00:35:05.046 --> 00:35:06.706 A:middle
existing property of a user

00:35:06.706 --> 00:35:07.236 A:middle
activity.

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:09.406 A:middle
It represents the minimal amount

00:35:09.406 --> 00:35:11.066 A:middle
of information that is necessary

00:35:11.066 --> 00:35:12.866 A:middle
to restore the app to the state

00:35:12.866 --> 00:35:13.806 A:middle
that the user activity

00:35:13.806 --> 00:35:14.336 A:middle
represents.

00:35:14.336 --> 00:35:17.366 A:middle
And for suggestions it will be

00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:19.216 A:middle
used to determine which keys of

00:35:19.216 --> 00:35:21.026 A:middle
the user info dictionary will be

00:35:21.026 --> 00:35:22.986 A:middle
used to compare when looking for

00:35:22.986 --> 00:35:23.466 A:middle
patterns.

00:35:24.476 --> 00:35:25.856 A:middle
Let's apply this to a previous

00:35:25.856 --> 00:35:26.326 A:middle
example.

00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:29.166 A:middle
Now we specify that

00:35:29.166 --> 00:35:31.246 A:middle
requiredUserInfoKeys are soup

00:35:31.436 --> 00:35:32.176 A:middle
and quantity.

00:35:32.726 --> 00:35:34.076 A:middle
Again, we donate the user

00:35:34.076 --> 00:35:36.026 A:middle
activity where the soup is

00:35:36.026 --> 00:35:38.066 A:middle
tomato, the quantity is 1, and

00:35:38.066 --> 00:35:39.226 A:middle
the scroll position is 79

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:39.606 A:middle
points.

00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:41.246 A:middle
But now the scroll position will

00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:41.816 A:middle
be ignored.

00:35:42.986 --> 00:35:43.946 A:middle
Next, we donate something

00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:45.556 A:middle
similar, and, again, the scroll

00:35:45.556 --> 00:35:46.326 A:middle
position is ignored.

00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:49.546 A:middle
We keep doing this, and, at some

00:35:49.546 --> 00:35:51.426 A:middle
point, Siri will try suggestion

00:35:51.426 --> 00:35:51.656 A:middle
again.

00:35:53.046 --> 00:35:54.546 A:middle
Now, I will look back and try to

00:35:54.546 --> 00:35:55.666 A:middle
find a pattern of equal user

00:35:55.666 --> 00:35:56.196 A:middle
activities.

00:35:56.196 --> 00:35:57.226 A:middle
And since it's no longer

00:35:57.226 --> 00:35:59.166 A:middle
considering the scroll position,

00:35:59.306 --> 00:36:01.616 A:middle
it might be able to say, "An
