00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:01.626 A:middle
First, I'll import our shared

00:29:01.626 --> 00:29:02.866 A:middle
framework, SoupKit [laughs].

00:29:03.956 --> 00:29:08.316 A:middle
Since we're going to handle the

00:29:08.316 --> 00:29:10.086 A:middle
OrderSoupIntent, this intent

00:29:10.086 --> 00:29:11.766 A:middle
handler needs to conform to the

00:29:11.766 --> 00:29:12.996 A:middle
OrderSoupIntentHandling

00:29:12.996 --> 00:29:13.606 A:middle
protocol.

00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:17.756 A:middle
This was generated as part of

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:19.356 A:middle
our intent.

00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:23.466 A:middle
This protocol has one required

00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:25.826 A:middle
method, the handle method.

00:29:25.826 --> 00:29:28.226 A:middle
Let's implement it.

00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:31.456 A:middle
In the handle method, I get an

00:29:31.456 --> 00:29:31.926 A:middle
intent.

00:29:32.746 --> 00:29:33.926 A:middle
I create an order from that

00:29:33.926 --> 00:29:36.186 A:middle
intent, and, if that succeeds, I

00:29:36.186 --> 00:29:38.226 A:middle
place the order, and I call the

00:29:38.226 --> 00:29:39.416 A:middle
completion with an intent

00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:40.916 A:middle
response with a success code.

00:29:41.706 --> 00:29:43.186 A:middle
If I'm unable to create an order

00:29:43.416 --> 00:29:45.016 A:middle
from the intent, I call

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.096 A:middle
completion with an intent

00:29:46.096 --> 00:29:47.326 A:middle
response with a failure code.

00:29:47.816 --> 00:29:49.566 A:middle
And that's it.

00:29:49.566 --> 00:29:50.946 A:middle
I've just added support for a

00:29:50.946 --> 00:29:53.016 A:middle
new intent in my app.

00:29:53.016 --> 00:29:53.686 A:middle
Let's try it out.
