00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.596 A:middle
the user performs the equivalent

00:16:00.596 --> 00:16:01.756 A:middle
of your shortcut in your app.

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:05.246 A:middle
In this case, every time the

00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:07.926 A:middle
user orders soup, I want to

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.396 A:middle
donate this intent, because

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:10.666 A:middle
that's going to help Siri learn

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.186 A:middle
when is the best time to predict

00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:12.336 A:middle
it?

00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:15.586 A:middle
So, all that's left, now that

00:16:15.586 --> 00:16:16.926 A:middle
we've defined our custom intent,

00:16:16.926 --> 00:16:17.956 A:middle
is to handle it.

00:16:18.216 --> 00:16:19.036 A:middle
And, just like with

00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:20.596 A:middle
NSUserActivity, you should

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:21.236 A:middle
implement the

00:16:21.236 --> 00:16:23.036 A:middle
continueUserActivity method in

00:16:23.036 --> 00:16:24.576 A:middle
your app delegate in order to

00:16:24.576 --> 00:16:25.366 A:middle
handle your intent.

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:28.056 A:middle
So, when an intent is opened in

00:16:28.056 --> 00:16:30.066 A:middle
your app, it's passed in as an

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:32.076 A:middle
NSUserActivity object, whose

00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:34.436 A:middle
activity type is the name of the

00:16:34.436 --> 00:16:36.086 A:middle
intent class that you generated

00:16:36.086 --> 00:16:36.496 A:middle
earlier.

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:37.686 A:middle
In this case, it's

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:38.926 A:middle
OrderSoupIntent.

00:16:40.146 --> 00:16:41.666 A:middle
But if you only implement

00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:43.306 A:middle
continueUserActivity, your

00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:44.796 A:middle
shortcut will open your app

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:45.446 A:middle
every time.

00:16:45.486 --> 00:16:47.036 A:middle
It won't run in the background,

00:16:47.036 --> 00:16:48.766 A:middle
or work inline in Siri, or

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:50.156 A:middle
support things like custom voice

00:16:50.156 --> 00:16:50.676 A:middle
responses.

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:52.706 A:middle
So, for the best experience, you

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.486 A:middle
want to create an extension to

00:16:54.486 --> 00:16:55.676 A:middle
handle your shortcut in the

00:16:55.676 --> 00:16:56.176 A:middle
background.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:59.716 A:middle
And to do that, create a new

00:16:59.966 --> 00:17:01.736 A:middle
target in your Xcode project and
