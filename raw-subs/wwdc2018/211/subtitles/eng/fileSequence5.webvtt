00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:00.376 A:middle
should be substantial, so you

00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:01.836 A:middle
shouldn't just expose a shortcut

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.346 A:middle
that does about the same thing

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:04.676 A:middle
as opening your app normally.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:06.936 A:middle
If you expose a shortcut that

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:08.096 A:middle
doesn't provide very much

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:09.636 A:middle
acceleration to the user, it

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:11.346 A:middle
won't be suggested as

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:11.826 A:middle
frequently.

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:15.446 A:middle
And, next, every shortcut that

00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:16.426 A:middle
you expose should be of

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.056 A:middle
persistent interest to the user,

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.286 A:middle
so that means it should be

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:20.236 A:middle
something that the user might

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.516 A:middle
want to do multiple times.

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:23.696 A:middle
It's not a good idea to expose a

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:24.966 A:middle
shortcut for something that the

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:27.126 A:middle
user might only want to use once

00:05:27.256 --> 00:05:28.976 A:middle
or twice.

00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:30.906 A:middle
And you should also expose only

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:32.706 A:middle
shortcuts that are executable at

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:35.036 A:middle
any time, because you can't rely

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:36.566 A:middle
on the user being in some

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.076 A:middle
particular state before your

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.596 A:middle
shortcut will be ready for use.

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:43.246 A:middle
So, once you've decided what

00:05:43.246 --> 00:05:44.406 A:middle
shortcuts to expose, you're

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:45.686 A:middle
ready to check out the

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:47.386 A:middle
shortcuts' APIs.

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:51.026 A:middle
There were two APIs that we

00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:52.766 A:middle
support for adopting shortcuts.

00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:55.316 A:middle
The first is NSUserActivity.

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.086 A:middle
NSUserActivity is a lightweight

00:05:58.086 --> 00:05:59.596 A:middle
way to represent the state of

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.426 A:middle
your app, and it integrates with
