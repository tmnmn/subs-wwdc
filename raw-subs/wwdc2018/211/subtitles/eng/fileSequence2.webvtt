00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.026 A:middle
And, when you tap on a shortcut,

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.776 A:middle
you can use it right in line

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:05.226 A:middle
with a rich custom UI specific

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:07.266 A:middle
to that app.

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:08.586 A:middle
And you can also add shortcuts

00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:10.096 A:middle
to Siri, so you can use them

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.876 A:middle
with your voice just by asking

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:12.406 A:middle
Siri.

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:14.316 A:middle
And in Siri you'll see the same

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:16.536 A:middle
custom UI that you see in search

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.496 A:middle
and on the lock screen.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.706 A:middle
And apps can provide a great

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.566 A:middle
voice experience in Siri by

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:26.086 A:middle
providing custom response dialog

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.176 A:middle
that Siri will read out loud to

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:30.976 A:middle
tell you things like how long it

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:33.076 A:middle
will take for your coffee to be

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:33.746 A:middle
ready.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:37.216 A:middle
So, when the user adds a

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:39.036 A:middle
shortcut to Siri, they get to

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:41.056 A:middle
pick a custom personal phrase,

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:43.536 A:middle
so the user chooses what to say

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.426 A:middle
to Siri to invoke your shortcut.

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.326 A:middle
And, as a developer, you get to

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:49.336 A:middle
suggest what phrase to use, so,

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.086 A:middle
in this case, a suggestion is

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:51.736 A:middle
"coffee time."

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.876 A:middle
And, once a shortcut has been

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.876 A:middle
added to Siri, it works across

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.686 A:middle
all of your iOS devices, and on

00:02:58.686 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
Apple Watch, and even on
