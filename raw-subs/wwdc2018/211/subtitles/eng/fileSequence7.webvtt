00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:02.436 A:middle
But for the best Shortcuts

00:07:02.436 --> 00:07:03.936 A:middle
experience, you'll want to adopt

00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:05.746 A:middle
intents, and intents-based

00:07:05.746 --> 00:07:06.646 A:middle
shortcuts are really cool,

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:08.596 A:middle
because they can run inline

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:10.156 A:middle
without launching your app.

00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:11.656 A:middle
And they can include custom

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.626 A:middle
voice responses and custom UIs

00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:14.726 A:middle
like we saw earlier.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.186 A:middle
And they can also include

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:17.956 A:middle
granular parameter predictions,

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:19.756 A:middle
which Willem tell you a little

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:20.346 A:middle
bit about later.

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:23.616 A:middle
So, once you've decided how to

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:25.356 A:middle
adopt, you're ready to dive into

00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:28.116 A:middle
the implementation, so let's do

00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:29.996 A:middle
that now.

00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:30.976 A:middle
First, let's go over how to

00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:31.766 A:middle
adopt shortcuts with

00:07:31.766 --> 00:07:33.586 A:middle
NSUserActivity, and the first

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.416 A:middle
step is to define your shortcut.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:37.376 A:middle
For NSUserActivity, that means

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:38.806 A:middle
you need to declare a

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:41.116 A:middle
UserActivityType in your app's

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:43.466 A:middle
Info.plist file to register your

00:07:43.466 --> 00:07:44.596 A:middle
activity type with the system.

00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:47.896 A:middle
Next, you need to donate your

00:07:47.896 --> 00:07:48.326 A:middle
shortcut.

00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:50.836 A:middle
For NSUserActivity, that means

00:07:50.946 --> 00:07:52.186 A:middle
every time the user is looking

00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:53.596 A:middle
at the screen in your app that

00:07:53.596 --> 00:07:54.716 A:middle
you want to provide a shortcut

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:56.076 A:middle
to, you should make an

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.836 A:middle
NSUserActivity object available.

00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:01.106 A:middle
So, there's one key new thing
