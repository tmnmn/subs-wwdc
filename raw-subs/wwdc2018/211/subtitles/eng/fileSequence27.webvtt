00:26:59.716 --> 00:27:01.266 A:middle
contains the intent of the

00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:03.126 A:middle
order, and then I just donate

00:27:03.126 --> 00:27:06.066 A:middle
that interaction, and that's it.

00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:08.606 A:middle
Finally, we need to handle the

00:27:08.606 --> 00:27:09.036 A:middle
intent.

00:27:09.366 --> 00:27:11.056 A:middle
I'll start by adding support in

00:27:11.056 --> 00:27:13.196 A:middle
the app itself, so I'll go to

00:27:13.196 --> 00:27:15.196 A:middle
the AppDelegate, and, in the

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:17.086 A:middle
continueUserActivity, I'll add

00:27:17.086 --> 00:27:17.686 A:middle
support for it.

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:22.086 A:middle
I check if the activityType of

00:27:22.616 --> 00:27:24.396 A:middle
the userActivity is equal to the

00:27:24.396 --> 00:27:26.096 A:middle
class name of the intent that I

00:27:26.096 --> 00:27:26.786 A:middle
want to handle.

00:27:27.216 --> 00:27:29.196 A:middle
If that's the case, I extract

00:27:29.196 --> 00:27:30.196 A:middle
the intent from the

00:27:30.196 --> 00:27:32.226 A:middle
userActivity, and I generate an

00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:32.886 A:middle
order with it.

00:27:33.346 --> 00:27:34.966 A:middle
Finally, I present the order

00:27:34.966 --> 00:27:35.276 A:middle
view.

00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:37.426 A:middle
So, since we're launching the

00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:38.966 A:middle
app, I'm assuming that the user

00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:39.776 A:middle
doesn't want to immediately

00:27:39.776 --> 00:27:41.096 A:middle
place the order but wants to

00:27:41.096 --> 00:27:42.746 A:middle
make some customizations before

00:27:42.746 --> 00:27:44.566 A:middle
placing it, so that's why I'm

00:27:44.566 --> 00:27:45.596 A:middle
presenting the order view

00:27:45.596 --> 00:27:46.036 A:middle
instead.

00:27:46.846 --> 00:27:50.276 A:middle
And, finally, let's add support

00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:52.556 A:middle
with an intents extension so the

00:27:52.556 --> 00:27:54.106 A:middle
user can run this intent in the

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:54.646 A:middle
background.

00:27:55.506 --> 00:27:56.776 A:middle
I'll need to add an intents

00:27:56.776 --> 00:27:58.216 A:middle
extension first, so I'll go to

00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:02.966 A:middle
File, View, Target and select
