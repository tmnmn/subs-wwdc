00:46:58.356 --> 00:47:01.016 A:middle
to Siri on your iPhone and

00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:02.216 A:middle
invoke it on your HomePod.

00:47:02.216 --> 00:47:03.866 A:middle
The audio will start playing

00:47:04.056 --> 00:47:06.746 A:middle
from your phone through HomePod.

00:47:08.296 --> 00:47:11.636 A:middle
We also created a new API that

00:47:11.636 --> 00:47:14.366 A:middle
allows you tell the system about

00:47:14.366 --> 00:47:15.476 A:middle
new content they might be

00:47:15.476 --> 00:47:16.146 A:middle
interested in.

00:47:18.646 --> 00:47:20.086 A:middle
This is great for periodical

00:47:20.086 --> 00:47:21.216 A:middle
content, where the content that

00:47:21.216 --> 00:47:22.496 A:middle
you would want to be suggested

00:47:22.496 --> 00:47:23.876 A:middle
to your users isn't something

00:47:23.876 --> 00:47:24.676 A:middle
they've listened to or watched

00:47:24.676 --> 00:47:24.976 A:middle
before.

00:47:28.206 --> 00:47:29.966 A:middle
So, those are a couple of things

00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:31.576 A:middle
that we have added to make great

00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:32.526 A:middle
media shortcuts.

00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:34.886 A:middle
Now, let's summarize what we

00:47:34.886 --> 00:47:35.616 A:middle
just talked about.

00:47:39.086 --> 00:47:41.156 A:middle
Shortcuts enable powerful, new

00:47:41.156 --> 00:47:44.116 A:middle
experiences with your apps.

00:47:44.116 --> 00:47:46.546 A:middle
It provides new ways to engage

00:47:46.546 --> 00:47:48.316 A:middle
your users by exposing your app

00:47:48.446 --> 00:47:49.846 A:middle
throughout the system in a

00:47:49.846 --> 00:47:50.896 A:middle
variety of places.

00:47:51.226 --> 00:47:53.126 A:middle
So, just search the lock screen,

00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:55.046 A:middle
the Siri Watch Face on your

00:47:55.046 --> 00:47:57.106 A:middle
Apple Watch, and in Siri itself.

00:47:57.616 --> 00:47:58.836 A:middle
You can also use it in the new

00:47:58.836 --> 00:48:00.616 A:middle
shortcuts app.
