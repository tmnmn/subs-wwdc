00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
Let's start using it.

00:26:00.676 --> 00:26:03.016 A:middle
I'll start by adding two helper

00:26:03.016 --> 00:26:05.426 A:middle
methods to our order object to

00:26:05.556 --> 00:26:06.596 A:middle
make it easier to convert

00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:08.016 A:middle
between it and the intent.

00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:11.566 A:middle
I'll go to the order class and,

00:26:11.606 --> 00:26:15.016 A:middle
at the bottom, I'll add an order

00:26:15.016 --> 00:26:15.536 A:middle
extension.

00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:20.146 A:middle
It contains a computer variable

00:26:20.146 --> 00:26:22.196 A:middle
that returns an intent.

00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:23.546 A:middle
In it, I create the intent.

00:26:23.886 --> 00:26:26.266 A:middle
I set the soup quantity and

00:26:26.266 --> 00:26:27.556 A:middle
options, and I return the

00:26:27.556 --> 00:26:27.926 A:middle
intent.

00:26:28.966 --> 00:26:30.316 A:middle
Extension also defines a new

00:26:30.316 --> 00:26:31.466 A:middle
initializer that dates an

00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:31.846 A:middle
intent.

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:34.316 A:middle
In it, I extract the soup,

00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:36.996 A:middle
quantity, and options, and then

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:38.786 A:middle
I initialize the order with

00:26:38.956 --> 00:26:40.096 A:middle
those values.

00:26:41.056 --> 00:26:42.216 A:middle
Great, this will be very

00:26:42.216 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
helpful.

00:26:43.926 --> 00:26:45.256 A:middle
Next, we need to make sure that

00:26:45.256 --> 00:26:46.996 A:middle
we donate the intent every time

00:26:46.996 --> 00:26:48.156 A:middle
the user places an order.

00:26:48.726 --> 00:26:50.296 A:middle
So, I'll go to the soup order

00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:53.026 A:middle
data manager, and, in the

00:26:53.026 --> 00:26:54.656 A:middle
placeOrder method, I'll add our

00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:55.436 A:middle
donation logic.

00:26:57.486 --> 00:26:59.716 A:middle
I create an INInteraction that

00:26:59.716 --> 00:27:01.266 A:middle
contains the intent of the
