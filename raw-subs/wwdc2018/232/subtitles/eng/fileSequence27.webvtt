00:26:59.566 --> 00:27:01.846 A:middle
keychain to pull out any stored

00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:02.896 A:middle
credentials that you may have.

00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:07.176 A:middle
From here the next step is we go

00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:09.686 A:middle
directly to your business server

00:27:10.156 --> 00:27:11.436 A:middle
to hit the OAuth website.

00:27:12.196 --> 00:27:14.716 A:middle
Now this can be existing or

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.186 A:middle
potentially a little bit change

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:18.836 A:middle
for Business Chat but it allows

00:27:18.836 --> 00:27:21.186 A:middle
you to carry the user through

00:27:21.386 --> 00:27:22.676 A:middle
your standard login flow,

00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:24.446 A:middle
including any extra additional

00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:27.566 A:middle
information, extra verification

00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:28.636 A:middle
fields, anything along those

00:27:28.636 --> 00:27:28.926 A:middle
lines.

00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:31.526 A:middle
At the end of OAuth your OAuth

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.386 A:middle
returns a token, this is your

00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:35.586 A:middle
login token and there it's sent

00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:36.576 A:middle
back to the Messages app.

00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:38.376 A:middle
What we do next is we encrypt

00:27:38.376 --> 00:27:39.886 A:middle
that token so no one else can

00:27:39.886 --> 00:27:41.766 A:middle
see it with a public key that I

00:27:41.766 --> 00:27:42.616 A:middle
mentioned earlier that's

00:27:42.616 --> 00:27:45.436 A:middle
included in the request.

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:47.066 A:middle
Now your token is encrypted and

00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:48.606 A:middle
it passes back up through the

00:27:48.606 --> 00:27:50.536 A:middle
Apple Chat Server which Apple

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:53.006 A:middle
can't read and it lands back to

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:53.436 A:middle
the agent.

00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:57.926 A:middle
Now at this time your agent may

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.156 A:middle
have the private key to decrypt

00:27:59.156 --> 00:28:00.436 A:middle
that or your business may have
