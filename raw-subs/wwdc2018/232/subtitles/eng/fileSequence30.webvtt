Or even providing information

00:30:04.046 --> 00:30:06.016 A:middle
such as drawing custom overlays

00:30:06.016 --> 00:30:07.856 A:middle
on the map to designate maybe

00:30:07.856 --> 00:30:08.886 A:middle
coverage areas or delivery

00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:09.000 A:middle
zones.

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:14.416 A:middle
Taking advantage of ARKit

00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:16.086 A:middle
provides a really a whole new

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.276 A:middle
level of interaction where

00:30:17.556 --> 00:30:19.006 A:middle

Chat could try out seeing what

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.936 A:middle
products may look like in their

00:30:22.936 --> 00:30:24.706 A:middle
natural environment right from

within Business Chat.

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.246 A:middle
We think these are some really

00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:31.206 A:middle
powerful examples of using your

00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:33.326 A:middle
own custom iMessage app.

00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:35.756 A:middle
So by now you've probably

00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:37.206 A:middle

about what it means to have and

00:30:46.226 --> 00:30:47.136 A:middle
leverage a shared app

00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:47.706 A:middle
