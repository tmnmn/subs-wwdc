00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:01.296 A:middle
They are specifically designed

00:40:01.296 --> 00:40:03.496 A:middle
for quick interactions that'll

00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:06.426 A:middle
add value and not be too

00:40:06.426 --> 00:40:07.866 A:middle
daunting for someone who is in a

00:40:07.866 --> 00:40:09.726 A:middle
conversation who just wants to

00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:11.266 A:middle
get stuff done with Business

00:40:11.266 --> 00:40:11.666 A:middle
Chat.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.226 A:middle
For that we recommend really

00:40:13.226 --> 00:40:14.636 A:middle
taking a look at all the things

00:40:14.636 --> 00:40:15.616 A:middle
you've done in the app and

00:40:15.696 --> 00:40:17.046 A:middle
what's appropriate in iMessage

00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:19.066 A:middle
apps, but also to custom tailor

00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:21.856 A:middle
it so they kind of fit and flow

00:40:21.856 --> 00:40:22.866 A:middle
into the user experience you're

00:40:22.866 --> 00:40:23.306 A:middle
looking for.

00:40:24.736 --> 00:40:26.336 A:middle
This is also a great way to

00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:28.666 A:middle
really stand out in Business

00:40:28.666 --> 00:40:29.596 A:middle
Chat and in your customer

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:30.686 A:middle
service experiences.

00:40:31.876 --> 00:40:33.346 A:middle
Then as I mentioned, integrate

00:40:33.546 --> 00:40:35.776 A:middle
with your message API button, BC

00:40:35.776 --> 00:40:37.326 A:middle
chat button and add it to your

00:40:37.326 --> 00:40:38.766 A:middle
apps, into your websites and

00:40:38.766 --> 00:40:39.000 A:middle
your emails.

00:40:43.056 --> 00:40:44.616 A:middle
So that's some best practices,

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:47.236 A:middle
that's what we would like you to

00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.736 A:middle
know about getting started as a

00:40:49.736 --> 00:40:50.486 A:middle
brand developer.

00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:52.026 A:middle
And now I'm going to hand it

00:40:52.026 --> 00:40:53.976 A:middle
back to Dan to finish this up.

00:40:54.516 --> 00:40:58.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:00.126 A:middle
Well done buddy.
