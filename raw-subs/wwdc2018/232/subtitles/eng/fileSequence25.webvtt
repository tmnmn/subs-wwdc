00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:01.526 A:middle
Their user can tap that to sign

00:25:01.526 --> 00:25:03.066 A:middle
in, up comes a sheet.

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.856 A:middle
This sheet contains a link,

00:25:05.996 --> 00:25:09.656 A:middle
basically it's displaying the

00:25:09.956 --> 00:25:12.426 A:middle
business' OAuth website directly

00:25:12.506 --> 00:25:14.146 A:middle
in the Authentication plug-in.

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.926 A:middle
The user can then tap in to one

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:17.796 A:middle
of the fields and they can

00:25:17.796 --> 00:25:19.026 A:middle
simply enter in their username

00:25:19.026 --> 00:25:20.566 A:middle
and password if they have it

00:25:20.566 --> 00:25:23.536 A:middle
remembered or they can tap the

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:25.916 A:middle
Password Lock icon which will

00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:27.666 A:middle
bring up a sheet of all the

00:25:27.666 --> 00:25:29.516 A:middle
saved passwords currently

00:25:29.516 --> 00:25:30.606 A:middle
already in your keychain.

00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:33.656 A:middle
The domain matched to the one

00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:35.436 A:middle
that is provided will be bubbled

00:25:35.436 --> 00:25:37.106 A:middle
to the top, you can then select

00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:37.876 A:middle
that.

00:25:38.626 --> 00:25:39.726 A:middle
The fields that we filled out.

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:43.986 A:middle
And once you log in you can

00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:46.996 A:middle
basically get a response to the

00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:48.266 A:middle
business verifying that they're

00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:48.706 A:middle
logged in.

00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:51.686 A:middle
So that's great, but how does

00:25:51.686 --> 00:25:52.206 A:middle
this all work?

00:25:52.986 --> 00:25:54.346 A:middle
So let me go through that now.

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:56.026 A:middle
As I mentioned, it starts off

00:25:56.286 --> 00:25:57.826 A:middle
with the CSP agent sending an

00:25:57.826 --> 00:25:58.936 A:middle
authentication request.
