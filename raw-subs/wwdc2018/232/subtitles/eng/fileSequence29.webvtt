00:29:00.496 --> 00:29:02.036 A:middle
really great innovative ways.

00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:04.416 A:middle
So today I'm going to talk for

00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:05.876 A:middle
your features how you can

00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:07.576 A:middle
leverage native iOS

00:29:07.576 --> 00:29:10.176 A:middle
functionality, some tips about

00:29:10.426 --> 00:29:12.486 A:middle
making your iMessage apps a

00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:15.336 A:middle
shared app architecture, and

00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:17.186 A:middle
talk a little bit about how to

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:18.186 A:middle
make that experience great.

00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:21.716 A:middle

you can really take advantage of

00:29:23.286 --> 00:29:25.696 A:middle
full native iOS frameworks and

00:29:25.696 --> 00:29:27.286 A:middle
code throughout the system, such

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:28.416 A:middle
as a front facing camera.

00:29:29.026 --> 00:29:30.016 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if you

00:29:30.016 --> 00:29:32.016 A:middle
could try out, have your users

00:29:32.016 --> 00:29:34.956 A:middle
send pictures of them using your

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:36.096 A:middle
products, testing your products

00:29:36.096 --> 00:29:37.586 A:middle
or even seeing what kind of

00:29:37.586 --> 00:29:39.466 A:middle
situation they are working with

00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:41.176 A:middle
to help give better customer

your iMessage app to display a

map and then the business can

00:29:55.736 --> 00:29:58.376 A:middle
send down things such as places

00:29:58.376 --> 00:29:59.336 A:middle
