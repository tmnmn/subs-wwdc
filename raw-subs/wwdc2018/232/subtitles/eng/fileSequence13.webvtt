KPIs for measuring synchronous

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
versus asynchronous

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:02.676 A:middle
communications.

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:03.936 A:middle
Okay let's talk about

00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:05.746 A:middle
integrating Business Chat entry

00:13:05.746 --> 00:13:06.266 A:middle
points.

00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:09.306 A:middle
So as you probably remember with

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:11.046 A:middle
Business Chat only users can

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:12.656 A:middle
initiate a conversation and

00:13:12.656 --> 00:13:14.036 A:middle
therefore it's even more

00:13:14.036 --> 00:13:15.986 A:middle
important to make sure it's very

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:17.756 A:middle
easy to discover ways in which

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:18.906 A:middle
to start a Business Chat

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:19.576 A:middle
conversation.

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:21.276 A:middle
So there's two key groups that

00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:22.256 A:middle
I'm going to talk about, there's

00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:24.396 A:middle
Apple native entry points and

00:13:24.396 --> 00:13:26.196 A:middle
then there are your entry points

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:27.606 A:middle
as a consumer brand.

00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:29.976 A:middle
Starting with Apple's native

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:30.696 A:middle
entry points.

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.466 A:middle
So when we announced the public

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:35.196 A:middle
release of Business Chat Beta in

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:36.816 A:middle
March we also announced the

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.746 A:middle
native release of being able to

00:13:38.746 --> 00:13:41.416 A:middle
search for brands in Siri, in

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:44.276 A:middle
Search, in Safari and in Maps.

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:46.896 A:middle
And we made this very simple so

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.106 A:middle
that you can go into Business

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:49.826 A:middle
Chat, your Business Chat account

00:13:49.826 --> 00:13:51.606 A:middle
in Apple Business Register and

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:54.376 A:middle
set up and configure these entry

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.976 A:middle
points for your business.

00:13:56.296 --> 00:13:57.566 A:middle
And in case you haven't

00:13:57.566 --> 00:13:59.196 A:middle
experienced this again here's a

00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:01.496 A:middle
quick example where I would
