00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.696 A:middle
The next key point, intelligent

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:01.456 A:middle
message routing.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.616 A:middle
So as you probably may recall

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:04.806 A:middle
from last year, we announced

00:08:04.806 --> 00:08:06.886 A:middle
intent and group IDs as part of

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.556 A:middle
the infrastructure support for

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:09.816 A:middle
message payloads that are being

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:11.486 A:middle
sent from me through the

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:13.276 A:middle
business chat API to the

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:14.306 A:middle
customer service platform

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:14.746 A:middle
provider.

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:16.806 A:middle
In this case, I may be searching

00:08:16.806 --> 00:08:18.316 A:middle
in the Maps app for a specific

00:08:18.316 --> 00:08:20.346 A:middle
location for Home Depot in Santa

00:08:20.346 --> 00:08:21.706 A:middle
Clara and I start the

00:08:21.706 --> 00:08:23.576 A:middle
conversation here by tapping on

00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:25.566 A:middle
the Message button.

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:28.646 A:middle
And it sends and appends in the

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.376 A:middle
intent and group ID the actual

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.285 A:middle
address that I've started at.

00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:33.765 A:middle
And so this is important because

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:35.006 A:middle
the intelligent routing of your

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:37.666 A:middle
platform may need to be able to

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:38.966 A:middle
based on your business rules

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.506 A:middle
route this to the right agent

00:08:40.506 --> 00:08:42.056 A:middle
group perhaps on the West Coast

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:43.405 A:middle
because of hours of operation.

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:45.356 A:middle
But it also supports the agent's

00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:46.896 A:middle
ability to then know where I

00:08:46.896 --> 00:08:48.626 A:middle
started my journey and be able

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:49.826 A:middle
to help me right away knowing

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:51.036 A:middle
I'm probably interested about

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.516 A:middle
that specific store location.

00:08:53.356 --> 00:08:55.336 A:middle
Okay lastly, quality of service

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:58.116 A:middle
monitoring, QOS, very important

00:08:58.116 --> 00:08:59.326 A:middle
and so in this example with the

00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
Nuance dashboard.
