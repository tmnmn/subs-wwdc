00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:01.496 A:middle
quick example where I would

00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:03.726 A:middle
start a search again on iOS on

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:04.886 A:middle
the home screen with a simple

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.666 A:middle
swipe down, I would type in

00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:08.366 A:middle
Discover the brand, I get the

00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:09.546 A:middle
search result, the business

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:11.326 A:middle
search result for Discover, I

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:12.846 A:middle
tap on the Business Chat button

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:14.696 A:middle
and boom I'm right into my

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:15.446 A:middle
conversation.

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:17.826 A:middle
Very easy, three steps.

00:14:18.196 --> 00:14:20.186 A:middle
Or coming back to the same

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.226 A:middle
search result I may tap on the

00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:24.066 A:middle
left side of the search result

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.306 A:middle
and that opens up what we call

00:14:26.306 --> 00:14:28.416 A:middle
the full preview of the business

00:14:28.416 --> 00:14:29.986 A:middle
card, which has a lot of

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:31.626 A:middle
important information that again

00:14:31.626 --> 00:14:33.476 A:middle
as a consumer brand you set up

00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:35.136 A:middle
in your Business Chat account in

00:14:35.136 --> 00:14:36.936 A:middle
Apple Business Register, such as

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:38.736 A:middle
what to expect from your agents

00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:40.976 A:middle
or your automation with response

00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:42.816 A:middle
time to messages or your live

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:44.476 A:middle
agents' hours of operations

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:45.766 A:middle
dependent on where they are.

00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:47.296 A:middle
So these are all things that you

00:14:47.296 --> 00:14:48.826 A:middle
can set up in your account and

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:50.726 A:middle
configure and update as required

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:51.956 A:middle
in your Business Chat account.

00:14:52.866 --> 00:14:54.606 A:middle
So again, really important to be

00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:56.006 A:middle
taking advantage and setting up

00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:57.776 A:middle
all of these and getting ready

00:14:57.776 --> 00:15:00.346 A:middle
to launch in your Business Chat
