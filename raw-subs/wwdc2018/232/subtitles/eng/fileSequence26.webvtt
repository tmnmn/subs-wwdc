00:26:00.176 --> 00:26:01.846 A:middle
This includes two pieces of

00:26:01.846 --> 00:26:02.876 A:middle
really important information,

00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:04.666 A:middle
the first is a public key.

00:26:05.176 --> 00:26:06.306 A:middle
This public key is going to be

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:07.916 A:middle
later used to encrypt the token

00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:08.806 A:middle
that you received from the

00:26:08.806 --> 00:26:10.426 A:middle
authentication request.

00:26:11.626 --> 00:26:13.406 A:middle
It also includes the URL of

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:16.406 A:middle
where the OAuth webpage lives

00:26:16.506 --> 00:26:17.886 A:middle
and we'll go through that a

00:26:17.886 --> 00:26:19.026 A:middle
little bit more in a minute.

00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:21.296 A:middle
So this is where it starts, the

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:22.496 A:middle
authentication request comes

00:26:22.496 --> 00:26:24.546 A:middle
down and it passes through, stop

00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:25.826 A:middle
on the way at Apple Business

00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:26.476 A:middle
Chat Server.

00:26:27.126 --> 00:26:27.996 A:middle
Now why do we do this?

00:26:27.996 --> 00:26:30.166 A:middle
This we added and we did a lot

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:31.386 A:middle
of thinking about this about

00:26:31.606 --> 00:26:32.476 A:middle
adding security.

00:26:32.516 --> 00:26:33.986 A:middle
We want to make sure that your

00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:35.536 A:middle
business has authenticated user

00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:36.966 A:middle
to the proper OAuth website.

00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.646 A:middle
And for that we make sure it's

00:26:39.646 --> 00:26:41.256 A:middle
the proper information that

00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:42.646 A:middle
you've already as a business

00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:44.086 A:middle
registered through Apple

00:26:44.086 --> 00:26:45.046 A:middle
Register previously.

00:26:46.206 --> 00:26:48.526 A:middle
We verify also that the request

00:26:48.526 --> 00:26:49.966 A:middle
contains all the required

00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:50.336 A:middle
fields.

00:26:50.906 --> 00:26:52.506 A:middle
And then finally we deliver it

00:26:52.506 --> 00:26:53.596 A:middle
in your Messages app for the

00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:53.966 A:middle
customer.

00:26:54.396 --> 00:26:56.296 A:middle
From there as I showed you can

00:26:56.296 --> 00:26:57.246 A:middle
either type in the password

00:26:57.246 --> 00:26:59.566 A:middle
manually or access the system

00:26:59.566 --> 00:27:01.846 A:middle
keychain to pull out any stored
