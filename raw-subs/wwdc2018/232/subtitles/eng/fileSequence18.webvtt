00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:01.046 A:middle
Okay brand email.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:04.016 A:middle
So again very targeted because

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.106 A:middle
you obviously have to target

00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:06.826 A:middle
this to specific Apple device

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:08.546 A:middle
users that most brands track and

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.336 A:middle
know who they are.

00:18:09.686 --> 00:18:10.736 A:middle
But a great opportunity where

00:18:10.736 --> 00:18:12.376 A:middle
1-800-Flowers is knocking it out

00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:14.306 A:middle
of the park being able to target

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:16.216 A:middle
these emails, offer promotions,

00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:17.956 A:middle
remind them of an easy checkout

00:18:17.956 --> 00:18:20.066 A:middle
benefit with Apple Pay and again

00:18:20.256 --> 00:18:21.996 A:middle
select that button, tap on it

00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:23.236 A:middle
and away you go, you're into a

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:24.006 A:middle
conversation.

00:18:24.296 --> 00:18:26.186 A:middle
Last key example I'm going to

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.936 A:middle
touch on is QR codes.

00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:29.506 A:middle
And so there's lots of

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:30.266 A:middle
opportunities that we're

00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:31.716 A:middle
starting to see pop up where

00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:34.036 A:middle
brands are using QR codes in

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:35.576 A:middle
storefront windows to capture

00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:37.116 A:middle
attention, they're using them at

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.716 A:middle
the checkout lanes, and they're

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.356 A:middle
also using them at check-in at

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:40.986 A:middle
hotels.

00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:42.416 A:middle
But this is a great example

00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:44.126 A:middle
where T-Mobile is in fact

00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:45.356 A:middle
exploring the opportunity to

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:47.736 A:middle
create a post-sale relationship

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:49.616 A:middle
by offering at the end of a

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:52.416 A:middle
conversation in-store on the ID

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:54.526 A:middle
badge of their in-store advisors

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:56.176 A:middle
the opportunity to start a

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.736 A:middle
conversation right there by

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.756 A:middle
simply holding up your iPhone

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.306 A:middle
with the built-in capabilities
