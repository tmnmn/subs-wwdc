00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.226 A:middle
A very efficient, very powerful

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:02.636 A:middle
way to implement Business Chat.

00:07:03.096 --> 00:07:04.886 A:middle
So let's talk about backend

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.186 A:middle
systems, so backend systems

00:07:07.186 --> 00:07:08.726 A:middle
integration is also very

00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:09.206 A:middle
important.

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
Your platform must have APIs

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.486 A:middle
that support your customers'

00:07:13.486 --> 00:07:15.886 A:middle
backend systems such as CRM,

00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:17.846 A:middle
scheduling, product inventory,

00:07:18.126 --> 00:07:20.856 A:middle
inventory ordering, order entry,

00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:22.046 A:middle
payment systems.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:23.416 A:middle
And in this example, it's a

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:25.016 A:middle
Salesforce lightning service

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:26.686 A:middle
console where because of a

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:28.236 A:middle
previous conversation they had

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:30.666 A:middle
my stable identifier, but

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:32.096 A:middle
they've now -- I've identified

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:33.436 A:middle
myself and they've now connected

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:34.496 A:middle
me to a profile.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:36.276 A:middle
So now when I come back, the

00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:38.956 A:middle
agent CRM profile comes up and

00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:40.136 A:middle
they know about me so I can

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:41.116 A:middle
start a very natural

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:42.676 A:middle
conversation right off the bat.

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:45.016 A:middle
And the agent has the ability to

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:47.066 A:middle
pull from their engagement case

00:07:47.576 --> 00:07:48.966 A:middle
history all the previous

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:50.796 A:middle
engagements I've had to again be

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.276 A:middle
able to pull back some history

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:54.226 A:middle
and go into a very fluid, easy

00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:56.006 A:middle
conversation with me-- super

00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:57.246 A:middle
important to have this backend

00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:58.746 A:middle
systems integration capability.

00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.696 A:middle
The next key point, intelligent
