00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:01.356 A:middle
in his example he is showing an

00:36:01.356 --> 00:36:02.706 A:middle
address getting passed through.

00:36:03.246 --> 00:36:04.956 A:middle
In my example I'm showing here

00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:06.806 A:middle
that you can programmatically

00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:08.016 A:middle
define an intent.

00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:11.356 A:middle
Maybe the user is browsing

00:36:11.456 --> 00:36:13.346 A:middle
through your app and has landed

00:36:13.706 --> 00:36:14.836 A:middle
on a certain shoe product.

00:36:15.246 --> 00:36:16.426 A:middle
You could tack on the product

00:36:16.426 --> 00:36:18.836 A:middle
information so right when the

00:36:18.836 --> 00:36:20.516 A:middle
Business Chat conversation comes

00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:22.296 A:middle
alive the customer service agent

00:36:22.296 --> 00:36:23.546 A:middle
already knows the product that

00:36:23.546 --> 00:36:24.726 A:middle
you're referring to.

00:36:25.746 --> 00:36:27.236 A:middle
The group allows you to specify

00:36:27.236 --> 00:36:30.126 A:middle
potentially where to route on

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:31.506 A:middle
the backend this conversation,

00:36:31.966 --> 00:36:33.346 A:middle
things like support or maybe

00:36:33.346 --> 00:36:35.666 A:middle
sales would be appropriate or

00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.286 A:middle
other as Dan showed, other

00:36:38.826 --> 00:36:39.896 A:middle
regional based kind of

00:36:39.896 --> 00:36:40.576 A:middle
specifications.

00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:43.916 A:middle
And then you can also even

00:36:44.046 --> 00:36:45.996 A:middle
specify some default text that

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.006 A:middle
when the user lands on the

00:36:47.006 --> 00:36:48.416 A:middle
message conversation will be

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:50.756 A:middle
automatically filled in on the

00:36:50.756 --> 00:36:52.176 A:middle
text field so all the user has

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:52.996 A:middle
to do is hit Send.

00:36:54.316 --> 00:36:55.696 A:middle
Great, so now I've configured

00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:58.346 A:middle
these parameters and the next

00:36:58.346 --> 00:37:00.066 A:middle
step I do is I call the
