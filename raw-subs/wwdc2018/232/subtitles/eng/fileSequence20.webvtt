00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:00.806 A:middle
Business Chat account once again

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:02.446 A:middle
by simply going into your

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:03.886 A:middle
account, tapping on the Brand

00:20:03.886 --> 00:20:05.936 A:middle
button, uploading your square

00:20:06.016 --> 00:20:07.316 A:middle
and wide logos and selecting

00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:07.906 A:middle
your background color.

00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:11.956 A:middle
Last key point, begin your app

00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:13.726 A:middle
planning early and by that we

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.776 A:middle
mean as you develop your

00:20:15.776 --> 00:20:17.986 A:middle
Business Chat team make sure

00:20:17.986 --> 00:20:19.676 A:middle
you're pulling in the app team

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:20.706 A:middle
at the same time.

00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
The combined collaboration of

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:25.106 A:middle
your two groups will deliver a

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:27.426 A:middle
much more powerful result with

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.066 A:middle
Business Chat user experiences,

00:20:29.446 --> 00:20:30.326 A:middle
largely because of the

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:31.646 A:middle
opportunity to take advantage of

00:20:31.646 --> 00:20:33.046 A:middle
iMessage apps as part of that.

00:20:33.396 --> 00:20:35.296 A:middle
And so to that point, let's

00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:36.526 A:middle
start talking about the brand

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:38.326 A:middle
developer and Scottie is going

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:39.636 A:middle
to join me back up on stage to

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:41.146 A:middle
walk us through that and other

00:20:41.146 --> 00:20:42.846 A:middle
great app development tools to

00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:44.266 A:middle
take advantage of for the best

00:20:44.266 --> 00:20:45.736 A:middle
Business Chat user experiences.

00:20:45.736 --> 00:20:45.946 A:middle
Scottie.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:52.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:53.386 A:middle

00:20:54.576 --> 00:20:56.756 A:middle
