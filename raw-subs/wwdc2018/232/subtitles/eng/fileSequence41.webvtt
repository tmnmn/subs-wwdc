Well done buddy.

00:41:00.236 --> 00:41:01.916 A:middle
Thanks Scottie, that was great.

00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:04.216 A:middle
And it's super exciting about

00:41:04.366 --> 00:41:06.676 A:middle
finally being able to launch the

00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:07.896 A:middle
OAuth authentication built-in

00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:08.306 A:middle
feature.

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.076 A:middle
That is going to be huge because

00:41:10.076 --> 00:41:11.906 A:middle
we have a ton of demand coming

00:41:11.906 --> 00:41:12.846 A:middle
at us for that type of a

00:41:12.846 --> 00:41:13.976 A:middle
built-in functionality, so

00:41:13.976 --> 00:41:14.796 A:middle
that's very exciting.

00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:16.826 A:middle
All right, some key things.

00:41:17.046 --> 00:41:18.366 A:middle
First of all, we've covered a

00:41:18.366 --> 00:41:19.966 A:middle
lot of highlights today but

00:41:19.966 --> 00:41:21.346 A:middle
there's a lot of great

00:41:21.346 --> 00:41:22.736 A:middle
documentation and information

00:41:22.736 --> 00:41:25.016 A:middle
available to you at this link.

00:41:25.706 --> 00:41:27.046 A:middle
And so, please make note of it,

00:41:27.766 --> 00:41:29.146 A:middle
if you haven't it now you'll be

00:41:29.146 --> 00:41:30.416 A:middle
able to afterwards in the video.

00:41:30.736 --> 00:41:33.086 A:middle
But it will take you to lots of

00:41:33.086 --> 00:41:34.466 A:middle
different documentation that

00:41:34.616 --> 00:41:36.296 A:middle
will cover many of the things

00:41:36.296 --> 00:41:37.376 A:middle
we've talked about would but be

00:41:37.376 --> 00:41:38.736 A:middle
able to drill down much deeper

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:40.106 A:middle
than that into our getting

00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:41.536 A:middle
started guides and best

00:41:41.536 --> 00:41:43.596 A:middle
practices, again being able to

00:41:43.596 --> 00:41:44.816 A:middle
get right into understanding how

00:41:44.816 --> 00:41:46.576 A:middle
to use Business Register, the

00:41:46.576 --> 00:41:48.046 A:middle
Sandbox which is critical of

00:41:48.046 --> 00:41:49.716 A:middle
course, and even last year's

00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:51.016 A:middle
video which we'd recommend you

00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:53.516 A:middle
revisit to just get again a good

00:41:53.516 --> 00:41:53.996 A:middle
primer.

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.556 A:middle
And so I'm going to leave you

00:41:56.556 --> 00:41:58.106 A:middle
with this one important thought

00:41:58.106 --> 00:41:59.996 A:middle
that once again today for the

00:41:59.996 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
first time we're going to open
