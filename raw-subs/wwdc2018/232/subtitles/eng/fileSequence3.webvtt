00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
tap on that, I get a choice, I

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:02.786 A:middle
select Heck yeah.

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.696 A:middle
And then now the automated

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
response wants to get me to

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.156 A:middle
actually log in so we can get

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:09.396 A:middle
into a lot of personal details

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:10.196 A:middle
about my account.

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:12.436 A:middle
I tap on the rich bubble, it

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.876 A:middle
opens an iMessage app for

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:15.196 A:middle
authentication, I enter my

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.936 A:middle
credentials and I'm in.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.486 A:middle
All easily done within the

00:03:18.486 --> 00:03:19.576 A:middle
message conversation.

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:21.586 A:middle
And so now I can continue to

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:22.596 A:middle
have a very detailed

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:24.176 A:middle
conversation about my account

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:26.006 A:middle
and by the way, if I get really

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.846 A:middle
busy and I have to leave to go

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.356 A:middle
do something else when I get

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:30.706 A:middle
back home or back to the office

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:32.226 A:middle
I can pick right back up where I

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:35.116 A:middle
left off on my Mac with the

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:35.806 A:middle
Messages app.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.586 A:middle
Or if I'm busy and I'm on the go

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:40.136 A:middle
I can receive and send Business

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.866 A:middle
Chat messages from my Apple

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:42.356 A:middle
watch.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.086 A:middle
Okay so that brings us to today

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.556 A:middle
and I'm really excited to

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:48.956 A:middle
announce that we're going to

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:50.486 A:middle
open the doors significantly

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.426 A:middle
wider to many more consumer

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:54.496 A:middle
brands around the world and more

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:55.786 A:middle
customer service platform

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:56.496 A:middle
providers.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:02.276 A:middle
Very excited yes, thank you.
