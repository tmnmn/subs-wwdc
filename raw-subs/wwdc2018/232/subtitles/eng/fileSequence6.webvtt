00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.966 A:middle
And so a dynamic widget provides

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.906 A:middle
the agent the capability to

00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:04.846 A:middle
populate with the right content

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
both image and text based on how

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:09.286 A:middle
Business Chat operates based on

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.416 A:middle
our API and built-in

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:12.466 A:middle
functionality so that the agent

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
can simply tap on that to send

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:17.026 A:middle
the payload down to me on my

00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:18.356 A:middle
iPhone when I'm communicating

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.046 A:middle
with the Lowe's agent so that I

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.616 A:middle
can make a simple selection

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.096 A:middle
because I'm looking for smart

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:25.206 A:middle
locks that support HomeKit.

00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:28.186 A:middle
Very easy to do, but the console

00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:29.766 A:middle
functionality is very important

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:30.836 A:middle
to have this built in.

00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:32.766 A:middle
So then I'm ready to make a

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:36.346 A:middle
purchase and I see oh, not my

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:38.526 A:middle
HomeKit smart locks I see red

00:06:38.526 --> 00:06:39.796 A:middle
heeled shoes, thanks Scottie.

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.386 A:middle
So now I guess I'm going to be

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.966 A:middle
buying red heeled shoes.

00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:44.816 A:middle
So but in this case the same

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:46.446 A:middle
thing an intelligent dynamic

00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:48.056 A:middle
widget that populates for the

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:50.386 A:middle
agent the Apple Pay payload that

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:52.616 A:middle
they can easily tap on again to

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:54.666 A:middle
send the payload to me so that

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:56.596 A:middle
all I have to do now is tap to

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:58.666 A:middle
authenticate using Touch ID or

00:06:58.666 --> 00:06:59.386 A:middle
Face ID.

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.226 A:middle
A very efficient, very powerful
