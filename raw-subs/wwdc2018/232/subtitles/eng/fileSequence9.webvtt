00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
Nuance dashboard.

00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:02.636 A:middle
Your platform needs to be able

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:04.576 A:middle
to monitor, analyze and provide

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:07.456 A:middle
statistics, KPIs, important KPIs

00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:08.786 A:middle
for your business customers.

00:09:09.036 --> 00:09:10.856 A:middle
And so being able to monitor

00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:12.476 A:middle
Business Chat conversations by

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:14.386 A:middle
agent and provide important

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:16.516 A:middle
statistics and KPIs, like the

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:17.916 A:middle
average response time for

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:19.816 A:middle
Business Chat for agents, as

00:09:19.816 --> 00:09:21.446 A:middle
well as perhaps for commerce

00:09:21.446 --> 00:09:22.996 A:middle
type transactions in Business

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.696 A:middle
Chat, the percentage conversion

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:26.416 A:middle
rates, all about trying to

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.726 A:middle
figure out how to increase their

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:29.496 A:middle
productivity and increase my

00:09:29.496 --> 00:09:31.006 A:middle
level of customer satisfaction.

00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:32.096 A:middle
So your platform needs to

00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:34.226 A:middle
support this type of analytics.

00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:37.356 A:middle
So once again four key areas

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:38.906 A:middle
that we look for when we think

00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:40.686 A:middle
about what qualifies as a great

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:41.756 A:middle
customer service platform

00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:43.646 A:middle
provider for Business Chat.

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:45.336 A:middle
Okay now that you've been

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:46.916 A:middle
approved there's a couple of key

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:47.896 A:middle
things that we're going to ask

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:49.746 A:middle
you to do, one is to invest time

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:50.836 A:middle
in training your sales and

00:09:50.836 --> 00:09:51.866 A:middle
systems engineers.

00:09:52.316 --> 00:09:53.916 A:middle
So we've created three modules

00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:55.936 A:middle
that we walk you through, all of

00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:57.206 A:middle
your sales and system engineers

00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:58.136 A:middle
wherever they are around the

00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:00.196 A:middle
world about general business
