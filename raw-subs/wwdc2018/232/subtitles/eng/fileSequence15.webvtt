00:14:57.776 --> 00:15:00.346 A:middle
to launch in your Business Chat

00:15:00.346 --> 00:15:01.276 A:middle
account in Apple Business

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:01.806 A:middle
Register.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.146 A:middle
But these are not as important

00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:06.556 A:middle
as your entry points and so by

00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:08.316 A:middle
your entry points we mean these

00:15:08.316 --> 00:15:09.586 A:middle
are the places in which your

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:11.676 A:middle
customers are most commonly

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:13.006 A:middle
engaging with you, it's your

00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:15.106 A:middle
content, it's your various

00:15:15.276 --> 00:15:16.416 A:middle
properties, whether it's

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.616 A:middle
websites or apps.

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:19.286 A:middle
This is where your touch points

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.556 A:middle
are most valuable.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.086 A:middle
And so we've created the

00:15:22.086 --> 00:15:23.816 A:middle
Business Chat button which is an

00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:26.546 A:middle
API driven way to embed and

00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:27.896 A:middle
initiate an entry point for

00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:29.466 A:middle
Business Chat and it has a

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:31.396 A:middle
unique URL embedded in it for

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:32.416 A:middle
your business ID.

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:34.536 A:middle
So let's look at some examples.

00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.886 A:middle
This is an example of how TD

00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:38.726 A:middle
Ameritrade has implemented the

00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:40.156 A:middle
Business Chat button in their

00:15:40.156 --> 00:15:41.106 A:middle
mobile website.

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.806 A:middle
And so contextually they look

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:45.336 A:middle
for opportunities where there's

00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:47.036 A:middle
the highest level of engagement,

00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:48.746 A:middle
where their customers typically

00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:51.116 A:middle
or prospects start to figure out

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.376 A:middle
okay I want to do something but

00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:53.656 A:middle
I'm not sure exactly what to do.

00:15:53.656 --> 00:15:54.866 A:middle
And so they place the Business

00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:56.086 A:middle
Chat button there and it's

00:15:56.086 --> 00:15:57.446 A:middle
getting tremendous results

00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:58.906 A:middle
because then I can simply tap on

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:00.336 A:middle
it in this contextual call to
