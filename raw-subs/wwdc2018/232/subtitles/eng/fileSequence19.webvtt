00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.306 A:middle
with the built-in capabilities

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.846 A:middle
of the camera to read the QR

00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:04.516 A:middle
code and start a conversation

00:19:04.516 --> 00:19:05.926 A:middle
even before you leave the store.

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:08.496 A:middle
Great way to again personalize

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:09.626 A:middle
that journey with your

00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:10.276 A:middle
customers.

00:19:11.056 --> 00:19:13.426 A:middle
All right, so super important

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:14.516 A:middle
that is part of getting ready

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:15.896 A:middle
for a launch that you've thought

00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:16.766 A:middle
through and found the most

00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:18.436 A:middle
valuable engagement touch points

00:19:18.436 --> 00:19:19.726 A:middle
with your customers and embedded

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.866 A:middle
the Business Chat button as you

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:22.276 A:middle
launch.

00:19:22.976 --> 00:19:24.886 A:middle
So next key step, two more

00:19:24.886 --> 00:19:25.306 A:middle
things.

00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:27.286 A:middle
One, preparing your logos

00:19:27.286 --> 00:19:28.706 A:middle
because they are well displayed

00:19:28.706 --> 00:19:29.656 A:middle
throughout the Business Chat

00:19:29.656 --> 00:19:31.706 A:middle
experience and so you have your

00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:33.286 A:middle
square logo and you have your

00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:33.966 A:middle
wide logo.

00:19:34.566 --> 00:19:36.046 A:middle
And so as a reminder in case you

00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:37.476 A:middle
haven't seen this, the square

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.796 A:middle
logo shows up in a search

00:19:38.796 --> 00:19:40.696 A:middle
result, the square logo shows up

00:19:40.696 --> 00:19:42.316 A:middle
on your actual full business

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:44.366 A:middle
card, it shows up in the message

00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:46.046 A:middle
tray so it easily, you know you

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:47.366 A:middle
can scan easily and look for the

00:19:47.366 --> 00:19:47.986 A:middle
brand that you were

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:48.716 A:middle
communicating with.

00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.436 A:middle
And then lastly, the wide logo

00:19:50.436 --> 00:19:52.476 A:middle
always the optimal choice to be

00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:53.786 A:middle
showing it at the top of every

00:19:53.786 --> 00:19:54.936 A:middle
business conversation to

00:19:54.936 --> 00:19:56.206 A:middle
reinforce your brand.

00:19:57.506 --> 00:19:59.256 A:middle
And it's easy to set up in your

00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:00.806 A:middle
Business Chat account once again
