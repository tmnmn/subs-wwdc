00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:00.076 A:middle
the networks to get ready for

00:11:00.796 --> 00:11:02.786 A:middle
helping your customers get ready

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:03.316 A:middle
to launch.

00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:06.166 A:middle
And then lastly, you need to

00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:07.936 A:middle
start to develop and implement

00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:09.636 A:middle
some great use cases for your

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.586 A:middle
customers and help them get to

00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:12.706 A:middle
the point where they're really

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:14.386 A:middle
ready to actually launch

00:11:14.386 --> 00:11:16.516 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:18.076 A:middle
Okay and then sorry one more

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.126 A:middle
point, you do need to notify us

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:22.086 A:middle
when you and your customer or

00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.166 A:middle
customers are ready for a launch

00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:25.526 A:middle
so that we can do a public

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:28.016 A:middle
launch review, a final QA before

00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:29.456 A:middle
we turn you on and publicly

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:29.926 A:middle
launch.

00:11:31.216 --> 00:11:33.106 A:middle
So again, these are a couple of

00:11:33.106 --> 00:11:34.506 A:middle
key qualifiers and some

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.296 A:middle
important steps of investment

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:37.566 A:middle
that you need to make as a

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:39.716 A:middle
potential CSP around the world

00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:40.386 A:middle
for Business Chat.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:42.706 A:middle
So let's talk about the consumer

00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:44.566 A:middle
brand, some points about how to

00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:46.056 A:middle
get ready, steps to get ready

00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:47.786 A:middle
for launching Business Chat as a

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:48.546 A:middle
consumer brand.

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:51.146 A:middle
Number one, the one thing we

00:11:51.146 --> 00:11:53.616 A:middle
learned is that Business Chat is

00:11:53.616 --> 00:11:54.756 A:middle
an asynchronous, more

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.356 A:middle
asynchronous like communication

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:57.556 A:middle
method is a little different

00:11:57.556 --> 00:11:59.196 A:middle
from synchronous and so just to

00:11:59.196 --> 00:11:59.916 A:middle
make sure that everyone

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
understands what that means I'll
