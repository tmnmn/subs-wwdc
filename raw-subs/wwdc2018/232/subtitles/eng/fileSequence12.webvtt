00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
understands what that means I'll

00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:03.246 A:middle
illustrate with a quick example

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:04.866 A:middle
between Hilton and Marriott, a

00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:06.036 A:middle
couple of our partners.

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.866 A:middle
I may start a conversation with

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:11.516 A:middle
the hotel brand looking for a

00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:12.956 A:middle
common use case like loyalty

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:13.446 A:middle
points.

00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:15.646 A:middle
And I may start that and have a

00:12:15.646 --> 00:12:17.006 A:middle
very synchronous communication

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.426 A:middle
back and forth on a Wednesday,

00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:20.086 A:middle
but then I get distracted, I'm

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:21.616 A:middle
doing other things so a couple

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.226 A:middle
days go by before I come back.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:25.716 A:middle
This becomes more asynchronous

00:12:25.716 --> 00:12:27.396 A:middle
now in nature, but because of

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:28.716 A:middle
the long-lived sessions of

00:12:28.716 --> 00:12:30.346 A:middle
Business Chat and because of the

00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:32.406 A:middle
stable identifier about me and

00:12:32.406 --> 00:12:33.826 A:middle
because I previously identified

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:36.046 A:middle
who I am a new agent that picks

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
back up in this conversation

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:39.116 A:middle
should pick back up right where

00:12:39.116 --> 00:12:40.396 A:middle
we left off, it's not about

00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:41.186 A:middle
starting over.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.796 A:middle
So it's a different etiquette

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.146 A:middle
and so we've come up with some

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:46.256 A:middle
great guidelines and some help

00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:48.576 A:middle
in documents to help get your

00:12:48.576 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
agents properly trained to be

00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:51.526 A:middle
able to manage these types of

00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:53.136 A:middle
conversations differently say

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.766 A:middle
from what they may be used to in

00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:56.446 A:middle
live webchat synchronously.

00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:59.056 A:middle
You also need to adjust your

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.866 A:middle
KPIs for measuring synchronous
