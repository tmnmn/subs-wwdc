00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:02.096 A:middle
showing the first step I just

00:35:02.096 --> 00:35:03.546 A:middle
have to import the Business Chat

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.076 A:middle
framework which is on the SDK.

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:07.876 A:middle
Then I can go ahead and

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:10.426 A:middle
instantiate a button of the BC

00:35:10.426 --> 00:35:12.066 A:middle
chat button and we allow you to

00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:14.366 A:middle
pass in some style information

00:35:14.366 --> 00:35:15.766 A:middle
depending on the look and feel

00:35:15.766 --> 00:35:16.986 A:middle
of your app, it may look better

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:18.546 A:middle
with a light style or a dark

00:35:18.546 --> 00:35:19.216 A:middle
style.

00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:22.236 A:middle
Then this is a standard button

00:35:22.236 --> 00:35:23.306 A:middle
so I'm going to add a target.

00:35:23.396 --> 00:35:24.956 A:middle
And what you'll note here is

00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:27.216 A:middle
this is available on iOS and

00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:27.746 A:middle
macOS.

00:35:27.746 --> 00:35:30.436 A:middle
So if you're making Mac apps or

00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:32.206 A:middle
iOS apps you can take advantage

00:35:32.496 --> 00:35:34.266 A:middle
of this with even a shared code

00:35:34.676 --> 00:35:36.376 A:middle
to have this available across

00:35:36.376 --> 00:35:37.046 A:middle
your platforms.

00:35:38.086 --> 00:35:40.506 A:middle
Once I've configured the what's

00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:41.566 A:middle
going to happen when I tap the

00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:43.646 A:middle
button I can go ahead and add

00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.376 A:middle
this button to my views and

00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:47.636 A:middle
configure constraints and all

00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:48.506 A:middle
the things to make the button

00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:48.876 A:middle
look great.

00:35:49.996 --> 00:35:52.906 A:middle
Now that's putting the button in

00:35:52.976 --> 00:35:53.406 A:middle
the app.

00:35:53.836 --> 00:35:54.836 A:middle
So what happens when the user

00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:55.446 A:middle
taps the button?

00:35:55.676 --> 00:35:59.526 A:middle
Well from here as Dan mentioned

00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:01.356 A:middle
in his example he is showing an
