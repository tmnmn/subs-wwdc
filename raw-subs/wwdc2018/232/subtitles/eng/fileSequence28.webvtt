00:27:59.156 --> 00:28:00.436 A:middle
that or your business may have

00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:02.666 A:middle
that private key depending on

00:28:02.986 --> 00:28:04.056 A:middle
the relationship and the

00:28:04.056 --> 00:28:05.356 A:middle
security that you've worked out.

00:28:06.056 --> 00:28:07.536 A:middle
We think a lot of people will

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:09.526 A:middle
actually want to send this

00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:10.846 A:middle
encrypted token back to the

00:28:10.846 --> 00:28:13.046 A:middle
business to verify and decrypt

00:28:13.396 --> 00:28:15.236 A:middle
to make sure that this is in

00:28:15.236 --> 00:28:16.376 A:middle
fact the person who has just

00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:18.596 A:middle
recently logged in and once

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:19.726 A:middle
you've decrypted it you can use

00:28:19.726 --> 00:28:21.776 A:middle
that to get all the important

00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:23.276 A:middle
customer information sent back

00:28:23.686 --> 00:28:25.426 A:middle
to the agent to help service

00:28:25.426 --> 00:28:27.726 A:middle
your account, such as your shoe

00:28:27.726 --> 00:28:29.086 A:middle
size or other order information.

00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:34.096 A:middle
So that's Authentication in iOS

00:28:34.096 --> 00:28:34.476 A:middle
12.

00:28:35.086 --> 00:28:36.396 A:middle
We think a lot of companies,

00:28:36.396 --> 00:28:37.866 A:middle
especially in healthcare and

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.006 A:middle
financial services will really

00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:39.396 A:middle
like this.

00:28:40.106 --> 00:28:41.136 A:middle
And that's what we have for

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.036 A:middle
built-in features, so you don't

00:28:43.036 --> 00:28:44.026 A:middle
have to write a single line of

00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:45.686 A:middle
code you can take advantage of

00:28:45.686 --> 00:28:47.446 A:middle
these by integrating with your

00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:49.326 A:middle
CSPs and your businesses today.

00:28:51.476 --> 00:28:54.226 A:middle
So next, you may want to take

00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:56.586 A:middle
this further and as I mentioned

00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:58.576 A:middle
we heard a lot of great examples

00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
of how this can be done and some
