00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:00.006 A:middle
different products and new in

00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:02.446 A:middle
iOS 11.3 and above we allow your

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:03.986 A:middle
business to specify if a section

00:23:03.986 --> 00:23:06.046 A:middle
should be a multiple selection

00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:07.096 A:middle
or a single selection.

00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:09.016 A:middle
Now this is great for some

00:23:09.306 --> 00:23:11.536 A:middle
experiences, such as like trying

00:23:11.536 --> 00:23:13.176 A:middle
to order a pizza where maybe the

00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:15.126 A:middle
crust is only, you can only have

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:16.666 A:middle
one crust on your pizza, one

00:23:16.666 --> 00:23:18.776 A:middle
crust type, but the toppings

00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:20.016 A:middle
you'd want to offer a range of

00:23:20.016 --> 00:23:21.176 A:middle
toppings the user can select

00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:21.466 A:middle
from.

00:23:21.846 --> 00:23:23.586 A:middle
So we allow that section to be

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:24.676 A:middle
have a multiple selection, so

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:26.406 A:middle
that's new in iOS 11.3.

00:23:27.766 --> 00:23:29.736 A:middle
Next, we have the Time Picker.

00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:31.546 A:middle
The Time Picker allows your

00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:33.146 A:middle
business to send a number of

00:23:33.256 --> 00:23:35.326 A:middle
preselected dates and times to

00:23:35.326 --> 00:23:36.746 A:middle
allow your user to select.

00:23:37.306 --> 00:23:39.026 A:middle
These also -- the Time Picker

00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:40.676 A:middle
also ties into your local

00:23:40.936 --> 00:23:43.296 A:middle
calendar store and will feature

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:44.626 A:middle
certain conflicts that you may

00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:47.056 A:middle
have conflicting with the time

00:23:47.056 --> 00:23:47.466 A:middle
selected.

00:23:48.786 --> 00:23:50.336 A:middle
Once you've selected a time and

00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:51.856 A:middle
you've sent this back to the

00:23:51.856 --> 00:23:53.536 A:middle
business you can easily then add

00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:54.606 A:middle
the appointment to your own

00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:56.606 A:middle
calendar and even get directions

00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:57.786 A:middle
to the event if the company

00:23:57.786 --> 00:23:59.766 A:middle
specifies a location.
