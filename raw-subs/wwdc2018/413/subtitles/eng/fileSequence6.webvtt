00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:00.756 A:middle
view as if it were an app so

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:02.316 A:middle
that you can identify bugs more

00:06:02.316 --> 00:06:04.086 A:middle
easily and develop an efficient

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:05.746 A:middle
workflow for developing your

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:06.566 A:middle
Playground books.

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:08.546 A:middle
Here you can see me stepping

00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:09.706 A:middle
through the code for the live

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:11.646 A:middle
view of the CI filter Playground

00:06:11.646 --> 00:06:12.986 A:middle
book that I showed your earlier.

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:16.416 A:middle
The Swift Playgrounds Author

00:06:16.416 --> 00:06:17.906 A:middle
Template is available for you to

00:06:17.906 --> 00:06:18.576 A:middle
download from

00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:22.426 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:24.736 A:middle
This Xcode project is compatible

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:26.776 A:middle
with Swift Playgrounds 2.1 and

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:29.506 A:middle
Xcode 9.3, both released earlier

00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:29.996 A:middle
this year.

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:32.286 A:middle
This project includes some

00:06:32.286 --> 00:06:33.686 A:middle
frameworks that were built using

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:35.706 A:middle
the Swift 4.1 Compiler since

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:36.956 A:middle
this is what Swift Playgrounds

00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:38.576 A:middle
2.1 currently uses.

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.296 A:middle
So it's really important that

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.636 A:middle
the version of Xcode that you

00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:43.836 A:middle
use for this project also uses

00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:45.406 A:middle
Swift 4.1.

00:06:46.536 --> 00:06:48.416 A:middle
The Swift Playgrounds Author

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.966 A:middle
Template includes three

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:51.296 A:middle
different targets whose products

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:52.736 A:middle
will help you author your

00:06:52.736 --> 00:06:53.336 A:middle
Playground books.

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:55.186 A:middle
The first target is called

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:55.816 A:middle
Playground Book.

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:57.566 A:middle
The second is called Book

00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:58.266 A:middle
Sources.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.156 A:middle
And the third is called Live
