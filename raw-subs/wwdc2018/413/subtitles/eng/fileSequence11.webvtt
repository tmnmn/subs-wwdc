00:10:59.616 --> 00:11:01.376 A:middle
that a learner can create and

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.546 A:middle
manipulate core image filters in

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:04.916 A:middle
the Source Editor and these

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:06.426 A:middle
filters will be sent over to the

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:08.556 A:middle
live view and applied on top of

00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:09.926 A:middle
live camera output for them to

00:11:09.926 --> 00:11:11.076 A:middle
see what those filters look

00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:11.336 A:middle
like.

00:11:12.346 --> 00:11:13.956 A:middle
Here we are looking at the

00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:15.756 A:middle
LiveViewController.Swift folder

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:18.566 A:middle
and I've implemented one of the

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:19.846 A:middle
methods that came in the

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:22.016 A:middle
template and below that I've

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:23.386 A:middle
added the rest of the code that

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:24.896 A:middle
I need to display the live

00:11:24.896 --> 00:11:26.856 A:middle
camera output in the live view.

00:11:27.866 --> 00:11:29.436 A:middle
As I mentioned, I also want to

00:11:29.436 --> 00:11:31.766 A:middle
apply core image filters on top

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:33.366 A:middle
of each frame of the live camera

00:11:33.366 --> 00:11:35.396 A:middle
output, so I've added a few more

00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:37.376 A:middle
files in my book level sources

00:11:37.606 --> 00:11:38.946 A:middle
and implemented a filter

00:11:38.946 --> 00:11:40.226 A:middle
renderer for applying this

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:42.126 A:middle
filter on top of the live camera

00:11:42.126 --> 00:11:42.546 A:middle
output.

00:11:43.406 --> 00:11:45.226 A:middle
So now if I select the

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:47.966 A:middle
LiveViewTestApp Target, I can

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:50.776 A:middle
actually run this code and see

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.116 A:middle
what my live view will look

00:11:52.116 --> 00:11:52.366 A:middle
like.

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.986 A:middle
And I've configured this app to

00:11:54.986 --> 00:11:56.296 A:middle
show the live view in a

00:11:56.296 --> 00:11:57.356 A:middle
side-by-side mode.

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:00.396 A:middle
So where we can see what the
