00:34:00.556 --> 00:34:01.606 A:middle
So now if Holly downloads

00:34:01.656 --> 00:34:03.000 A:middle
Content Aware Resizing --

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:05.866 A:middle
And opens it up.

00:34:08.496 --> 00:34:09.516 A:middle
Cool, it worked.

00:34:10.406 --> 00:34:11.406 A:middle
So, in the live view on the

00:34:11.406 --> 00:34:13.005 A:middle
right I have this beautiful

00:34:13.005 --> 00:34:14.795 A:middle
picture of Monument Valley and

00:34:14.795 --> 00:34:15.926 A:middle
I'm going to have Holly crop it

00:34:15.926 --> 00:34:17.005 A:middle
a little bit and then run the

00:34:17.005 --> 00:34:18.386 A:middle
code and we'll see what it

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:19.000 A:middle
produces.

00:34:25.045 --> 00:34:26.866 A:middle
So what this algorithm does is

00:34:26.866 --> 00:34:28.735 A:middle
it looks at all of the vertical

00:34:28.826 --> 00:34:31.166 A:middle
seams in an image, decides which

00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:33.676 A:middle
of the seams are least different

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:34.646 A:middle
from the ones around it and

00:34:34.646 --> 00:34:35.766 A:middle
removes those one by one.

00:34:36.196 --> 00:34:37.516 A:middle
So now we can see it's a little

00:34:37.516 --> 00:34:39.275 A:middle
bit cropped and it looks

00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:40.000 A:middle
beautiful.

00:34:50.056 --> 00:34:51.226 A:middle
