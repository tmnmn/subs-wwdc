00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:00.396 A:middle
So where we can see what the

00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:02.366 A:middle
live view will look like in a

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:03.866 A:middle
side-by-side mode similarly to

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:05.076 A:middle
how it would be shown next to

00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:06.476 A:middle
the Source Code Editor in Swift

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:06.986 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:12:07.306 --> 00:12:08.776 A:middle
And to simulate sending filters

00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:10.276 A:middle
over to the live view, I've

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:11.906 A:middle
added a couple of buttons, which

00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:13.096 A:middle
you see here on the left.

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:14.736 A:middle
And these are implemented in my

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:15.626 A:middle
test app code.

00:12:15.816 --> 00:12:17.466 A:middle
So now if Grace taps on one of

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:19.566 A:middle
the filters, we should see that

00:12:19.566 --> 00:12:20.716 A:middle
filter applied to the live

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:21.446 A:middle
camera output.

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.216 A:middle
So this looks great.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.826 A:middle
I want to try out some of the

00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:26.966 A:middle
other filters, so Grace I really

00:12:26.966 --> 00:12:28.926 A:middle
like the CIPointillize filter.

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:32.576 A:middle
So if she taps on that this

00:12:32.576 --> 00:12:34.866 A:middle
looks pretty close but if you

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:37.836 A:middle
can -- if you notice the pink

00:12:37.836 --> 00:12:39.536 A:middle
filter from before is still

00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:41.946 A:middle
around some of the edges and the

00:12:41.946 --> 00:12:43.116 A:middle
pointillize filter is a little

00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:44.146 A:middle
smaller than we want.

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:45.536 A:middle
So I'm going to head back over

00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:47.256 A:middle
to Xcode because I think we have

00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:49.236 A:middle
a bug in my filter renderer that

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.286 A:middle
I wrote in a function called

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:51.716 A:middle
Render.

00:12:52.026 --> 00:12:53.136 A:middle
So I'm going to navigate to that

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.646 A:middle
function using Open Quickly with

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:55.616 A:middle
Command Shift O.

00:12:56.766 --> 00:12:58.356 A:middle
And I'm going to set a

00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
breakpoint right before this
