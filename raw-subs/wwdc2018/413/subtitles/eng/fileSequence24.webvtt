00:23:59.316 --> 00:24:01.000 A:middle
earlier this week.

00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:05.456 A:middle
After you've created that file,

00:24:05.626 --> 00:24:06.486 A:middle
make sure it's in your

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:08.686 A:middle
repository, commit your changes,

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:10.056 A:middle
push, and then visit your

00:24:10.056 --> 00:24:12.956 A:middle
website at username.github.io.

00:24:13.896 --> 00:24:15.096 A:middle
As you continue adding more

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:16.166 A:middle
files and folders to your

00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:17.606 A:middle
repository and continue to

00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:18.876 A:middle
commit and push them up to your

00:24:18.876 --> 00:24:20.896 A:middle
website, it will update your

00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:22.026 A:middle
repository and therefore

00:24:22.026 --> 00:24:22.836 A:middle
GitHub's website.

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.196 A:middle
So right now the folder only has

00:24:27.196 --> 00:24:28.996 A:middle
one file, index.html.

00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:30.706 A:middle
This will serve as your landing

00:24:30.706 --> 00:24:31.706 A:middle
page for your website.

00:24:32.066 --> 00:24:33.546 A:middle
But as we talked about earlier

00:24:33.546 --> 00:24:34.736 A:middle
you'll need a couple more files

00:24:34.766 --> 00:24:35.936 A:middle
to support your subscription.

00:24:36.786 --> 00:24:38.696 A:middle
So as Holly mentioned, we have

00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:39.906 A:middle
been working on a subscription

00:24:39.906 --> 00:24:41.816 A:middle
called WWDC Photo Filters that

00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:42.896 A:middle
has some really cool photo

00:24:42.896 --> 00:24:44.246 A:middle
filtering content using Core

00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:45.486 A:middle
Image within Swift Playgrounds.

00:24:45.696 --> 00:24:46.916 A:middle
I'm going to walk you though the

00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.536 A:middle
levels of our repository to show

00:24:48.536 --> 00:24:49.716 A:middle
how we've organized it as an

00:24:49.716 --> 00:24:50.156 A:middle
example.

00:24:52.536 --> 00:24:54.456 A:middle
The first file that needs to be

00:24:54.456 --> 00:24:56.506 A:middle
included is your feed.JSON file.

00:24:57.096 --> 00:24:58.676 A:middle
We've put ours in our repository

00:24:58.676 --> 00:24:59.856 A:middle
at the same level as our

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:01.376 A:middle
index.html file.
