00:30:00.176 --> 00:30:01.806 A:middle
So I'm ready to put it up and

00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:02.786 A:middle
publish it.

00:30:03.336 --> 00:30:04.996 A:middle
So I've created a workspace for

00:30:04.996 --> 00:30:05.846 A:middle
my repository.

00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.206 A:middle
So I'm going to take this folder

00:30:08.266 --> 00:30:12.036 A:middle
and drag it over, put it within

00:30:12.036 --> 00:30:14.146 A:middle
my repository, and now I have

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:14.986 A:middle
another folder for

00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:16.366 A:middle
ContentAwareResizing.

00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:18.676 A:middle
Double check that everything is

00:30:18.746 --> 00:30:20.536 A:middle
still there and it looks good.

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:22.986 A:middle
So the last step that we'll need

00:30:22.986 --> 00:30:24.516 A:middle
to take is to update our

00:30:24.516 --> 00:30:25.646 A:middle
feed.JSON file.

00:30:25.916 --> 00:30:29.046 A:middle
So here's that file and you can

00:30:29.046 --> 00:30:30.856 A:middle
see in My Documents array I have

00:30:30.906 --> 00:30:33.076 A:middle
my Image Transitions object, my

00:30:33.076 --> 00:30:34.926 A:middle
Intro to Core Image object, and

00:30:34.926 --> 00:30:36.726 A:middle
my Test Out CI Filters Object.

00:30:36.846 --> 00:30:38.796 A:middle
So I need to add one more object

00:30:38.796 --> 00:30:40.076 A:middle
for ContentAwareResizing.

00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:43.946 A:middle
And luckily I've made a snippet

00:30:43.986 --> 00:30:47.626 A:middle
for it and here we go.

00:30:47.926 --> 00:30:48.796 A:middle
So I've all ready filled most of

00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:50.396 A:middle
this out because of my nails

00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:52.646 A:middle
[laughs], so all I need to do is

00:30:52.646 --> 00:30:54.676 A:middle
type in the title and I'm going

00:30:55.696 --> 00:30:57.456 A:middle
to call this

00:30:58.236 --> 00:30:59.186 A:middle
ContentAwareResizing.
