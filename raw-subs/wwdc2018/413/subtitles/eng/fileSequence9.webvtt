00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:01.096 A:middle
The first two are the

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:02.436 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport and the

00:09:02.436 --> 00:09:03.726 A:middle
PlaygroundBluetooth Frameworks

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:04.636 A:middle
from Swift Playgrounds.

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:06.486 A:middle
Including these frameworks in

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:08.036 A:middle
the project allows the book

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:09.926 A:middle
sources and the LiveViewTestApp

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:11.506 A:middle
Targets to take full advantage

00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:12.766 A:middle
of the APIs from these

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:13.366 A:middle
frameworks.

00:09:14.456 --> 00:09:16.116 A:middle
And the third supporting frame

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
work is called LiveViewHost.

00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:19.826 A:middle
And this framework is used by

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:21.526 A:middle
LiveViewTestApp for displaying

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:23.000 A:middle
the live view.

00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:27.406 A:middle
To implement your live view,

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.806 A:middle
you'll need to add all of your

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:30.336 A:middle
code in the book level auxiliary

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.636 A:middle
sources for your Playground

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:32.296 A:middle
book.

00:09:32.516 --> 00:09:34.176 A:middle
Included in the template is a

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:35.536 A:middle
view controller for your live

00:09:35.536 --> 00:09:36.976 A:middle
view in a file called

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.626 A:middle
LiveViewController.Swift.

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:40.996 A:middle
Also included in the template is

00:09:40.996 --> 00:09:42.406 A:middle
a helper function for loading an

00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:44.376 A:middle
instance of your live view in a

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.016 A:middle
file called

00:09:45.016 --> 00:09:46.446 A:middle
LiveViewSupport.Swift.

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.916 A:middle
You can add any other files that

00:09:48.916 --> 00:09:50.186 A:middle
you need to implement your live

00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:52.416 A:middle
view and you can use any of the

00:09:52.416 --> 00:09:53.876 A:middle
Playgrounds frameworks in your

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:54.856 A:middle
book sources code.

00:09:55.326 --> 00:09:58.766 A:middle
Also included in the template is

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.046 A:middle
a storyboard for you to
