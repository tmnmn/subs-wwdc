00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:03.836 A:middle
Each level in the Playground

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:05.466 A:middle
book hierarchy also contains a

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:07.376 A:middle
property list file for metadata

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:09.496 A:middle
that Swift Playground uses to

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:10.536 A:middle
configure the structure of the

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:12.196 A:middle
book and to construct the table

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:12.946 A:middle
of contents.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.286 A:middle
And finally, in addition to the

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:17.676 A:middle
content that is shown to your

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.636 A:middle
learner in a page, Playground

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:21.076 A:middle
books may contain additional

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.816 A:middle
Swift files called auxiliary

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:23.356 A:middle
sources.

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.416 A:middle
And these are stored in folders

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.446 A:middle
names Sources.

00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:29.856 A:middle
Auxiliary sources allow you to

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:31.566 A:middle
provide additional Swift code

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:33.646 A:middle
like classes or helper functions

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:34.866 A:middle
that can be used throughout the

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:36.906 A:middle
pages in your Playground book.

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.706 A:middle
You can use auxiliary source

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.406 A:middle
files to achieve many different

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:41.916 A:middle
tasks.

00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:43.916 A:middle
And by utilizing these sources,

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:45.476 A:middle
you can greatly simplify the

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:46.746 A:middle
code that you need to write in

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:49.906 A:middle
each page in your book.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.616 A:middle
Let's look at an example of

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:53.016 A:middle
using auxiliary sources to

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:54.556 A:middle
simplify communicating with the

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:55.186 A:middle
live view.

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:59.766 A:middle
You can send values to the live

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
view by calling the send method
