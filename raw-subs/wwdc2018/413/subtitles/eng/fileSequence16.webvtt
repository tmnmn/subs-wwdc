00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.226 A:middle
those documents and put them

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:01.316 A:middle
into a subscription.

00:16:02.716 --> 00:16:04.116 A:middle
So first off what is a

00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:04.796 A:middle
subscription?

00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:06.166 A:middle
You should think of a

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:08.016 A:middle
subscription like Podcasts or

00:16:08.016 --> 00:16:09.316 A:middle
like a magazine subscription.

00:16:09.796 --> 00:16:11.196 A:middle
So when new content is published

00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:13.036 A:middle
by the author, subscribers will

00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:14.256 A:middle
become aware of it.

00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:16.516 A:middle
Subscriptions show up here along

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:17.636 A:middle
side Apple content.

00:16:18.266 --> 00:16:19.586 A:middle
When you publish a new document

00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:21.126 A:middle
to your subscription, Swift

00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:22.376 A:middle
Playgrounds will fetch it and

00:16:22.376 --> 00:16:23.666 A:middle
display it to the user as a

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:27.106 A:middle
another document to check out.

00:16:27.376 --> 00:16:28.736 A:middle
Users can subscribe to your

00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:30.426 A:middle
subscription by visiting your

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:31.000 A:middle
website.

00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:37.016 A:middle
Subscriptions live online as a

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:38.696 A:middle
feed of downloadable content

00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:39.586 A:middle
that you publish.

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:41.486 A:middle
The way that you publish your

00:16:41.486 --> 00:16:42.446 A:middle
content will be through

00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:44.466 A:middle
publishing JSON files that have

00:16:44.466 --> 00:16:45.736 A:middle
all of the data that Swift

00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:47.486 A:middle
Playgrounds needs to download

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:48.000 A:middle
your content.

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:51.486 A:middle
In case you haven't used it

00:16:51.486 --> 00:16:53.576 A:middle
before, JSON is a techs-based

00:16:53.576 --> 00:16:55.296 A:middle
document format for storing and

00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:56.156 A:middle
exchanging data.

00:16:57.096 --> 00:16:58.426 A:middle
The goal is to communicate to

00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:00.016 A:middle
the consumer of the JSON object
