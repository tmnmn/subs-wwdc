00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
breakpoint right before this

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:01.136 A:middle
method returns.

00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:03.426 A:middle
And since each frame of the live

00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:04.926 A:middle
camera output is getting a

00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:06.536 A:middle
filter applied on top of it, we

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:07.806 A:middle
should hit this breakpoint right

00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:09.026 A:middle
away because this method is

00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:09.956 A:middle
constantly called.

00:13:10.886 --> 00:13:12.616 A:middle
OK great. So we've hit the break

00:13:12.676 --> 00:13:15.106 A:middle
point and now I can inspect any

00:13:15.106 --> 00:13:16.466 A:middle
of my variables here using the

00:13:16.466 --> 00:13:17.346 A:middle
debug console.

00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:19.456 A:middle
So specifically I want too look

00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:21.766 A:middle
at the size of the source image

00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:26.166 A:middle
and the size of the filtered

00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:28.976 A:middle
image and see how those differ.

00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:34.096 A:middle
OK, so as we can see the size of

00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:35.796 A:middle
the filtered image is larger

00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:36.816 A:middle
than the size of the source

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.306 A:middle
image.

00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:40.066 A:middle
And on line 59 I'm rendering the

00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:42.826 A:middle
filtered image to the size of

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:44.396 A:middle
the filtered image, but really

00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:45.676 A:middle
what I wanted was the size of

00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:46.436 A:middle
the source image.

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:47.576 A:middle
So I'm going to fix that.

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.636 A:middle
Disable the breakpoint and run

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:52.976 A:middle
it again.

00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:54.406 A:middle
Let's head back over to the

00:13:54.406 --> 00:13:54.806 A:middle
iPad.

00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:59.706 A:middle
And let's have Grace take the

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:00.986 A:middle
same steps as before.
