00:19:00.046 --> 00:19:02.586 A:middle
And lastly we need our documents

00:19:02.636 --> 00:19:02.866 A:middle
key.

00:19:03.406 --> 00:19:04.466 A:middle
So this is the beginning of the

00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.376 A:middle
second section of the Playground

00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:06.876 A:middle
feed format.

00:19:07.716 --> 00:19:09.186 A:middle
The value for this key should be

00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:10.986 A:middle
an array of objects that

00:19:10.986 --> 00:19:12.636 A:middle
represent your Playground Books

00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:13.266 A:middle
within your feed.

00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:14.956 A:middle
So next we'll talk about the

00:19:14.956 --> 00:19:17.966 A:middle
format of these objects.

00:19:18.216 --> 00:19:21.646 A:middle
Documents is an array of objects

00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:24.276 A:middle
that represent documents with

00:19:24.276 --> 00:19:25.126 A:middle
key value pairs.

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:27.306 A:middle
Let's go through what you need

00:19:27.306 --> 00:19:28.856 A:middle
to represent a document and then

00:19:28.856 --> 00:19:29.686 A:middle
we'll put it all together.

00:19:31.596 --> 00:19:33.956 A:middle
Title and overviewSubtitle are

00:19:33.956 --> 00:19:34.436 A:middle
strings.

00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:36.296 A:middle
They should be the tile and the

00:19:36.296 --> 00:19:37.376 A:middle
subtitle for each of your

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:38.046 A:middle
documents.

00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:39.886 A:middle
And they show up within your

00:19:39.886 --> 00:19:42.276 A:middle
subscription cell and also

00:19:42.276 --> 00:19:43.896 A:middle
within Detail Views for each of

00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:44.586 A:middle
your documents.

00:19:48.176 --> 00:19:50.096 A:middle
Detail subtitle is an optional

00:19:50.096 --> 00:19:51.866 A:middle
string that you can use to

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:53.236 A:middle
create a different subtitle to

00:19:53.236 --> 00:19:54.896 A:middle
be shown in Detail Views like

00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:55.146 A:middle
here.

00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:57.496 A:middle
If you don't provide one, we'll

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.000 A:middle
just omit that section.
