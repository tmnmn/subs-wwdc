00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.046 A:middle
a storyboard for you to

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.626 A:middle
configure the UI for your live

00:10:01.626 --> 00:10:01.896 A:middle
view.

00:10:02.846 --> 00:10:04.366 A:middle
You can add any other resources

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:05.686 A:middle
that your Playground book needs

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.276 A:middle
in the private resources group.

00:10:07.686 --> 00:10:10.626 A:middle
And finally, to configure your

00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:12.926 A:middle
live view test for the test app,

00:10:13.276 --> 00:10:14.546 A:middle
you'll need to implement a

00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:16.446 A:middle
method in AppDelegate.Swift.

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:18.386 A:middle
Specifically, you'll need to

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:19.736 A:middle
implement the setUpLiveView

00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:20.186 A:middle
method.

00:10:21.066 --> 00:10:22.936 A:middle
By default, this method loads an

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.566 A:middle
instance of LiveViewController

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:26.596 A:middle
from LiveView.storybaord from

00:10:26.596 --> 00:10:27.536 A:middle
the helper method that I

00:10:27.536 --> 00:10:28.266 A:middle
mentioned in

00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:29.526 A:middle
LiveViewSupport.swift.

00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
And this is called

00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:31.526 A:middle
instantiateLiveView.

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:35.396 A:middle
Now I want to invite Grace back

00:10:35.396 --> 00:10:36.976 A:middle
up to the stage and we'll take a

00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:38.096 A:middle
look at the Playground book that

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.356 A:middle
we've been working on using the

00:10:39.356 --> 00:10:40.306 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds Author

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:40.726 A:middle
Template.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:48.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:51.966 A:middle
OK, so here we're looking at my

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:54.026 A:middle
Xcode project for the test out

00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:55.656 A:middle
CI filters Playground book that

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:56.796 A:middle
I showed you a sneak peak of

00:10:56.876 --> 00:10:57.286 A:middle
earlier.

00:10:57.886 --> 00:10:59.616 A:middle
And the idea for this book is

00:10:59.616 --> 00:11:01.376 A:middle
that a learner can create and
