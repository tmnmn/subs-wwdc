00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:00.896 A:middle
completion or quick help.

00:08:00.896 --> 00:08:02.986 A:middle
And finally, the LiveViewTestApp

00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:05.056 A:middle
uses this target for displaying

00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:05.876 A:middle
the live view.

00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:07.486 A:middle
So you're implementation for the

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:09.186 A:middle
live view of your book must be

00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:10.646 A:middle
in your book-level sources if

00:08:10.646 --> 00:08:13.926 A:middle
you want to use the test app for

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:14.416 A:middle
debugging.

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:15.496 A:middle
Lastly, we have the

00:08:15.496 --> 00:08:16.906 A:middle
LiveViewTestApp Target.

00:08:17.616 --> 00:08:18.806 A:middle
You can find all of the files

00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:19.916 A:middle
for this target in the

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.056 A:middle
LiveViewTestApp group in Xcode.

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:25.426 A:middle
This target produces an app that

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:26.986 A:middle
displays the live view of your

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:28.776 A:middle
Playground book similarly to how

00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:30.006 A:middle
it would be shown in Swift

00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:30.496 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:33.326 A:middle
As I mentioned before, the

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:34.556 A:middle
implementation for your live

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.366 A:middle
view must be in your book level

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:37.385 A:middle
auxiliary resources.

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:40.446 A:middle
The LiveViewTestApp allows you

00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:42.356 A:middle
to debug your live view in a

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
full screen or in a side-by-side

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:45.746 A:middle
mode without first having to

00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:47.406 A:middle
export your Playground book to

00:08:47.406 --> 00:08:48.116 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds.

00:08:49.036 --> 00:08:50.766 A:middle
The LiveViewTestApp works on

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:53.096 A:middle
iPad and in the iOS Simulator.

00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:56.506 A:middle
The Swift Playgrounds Author

00:08:56.506 --> 00:08:57.976 A:middle
Template comes with three

00:08:57.976 --> 00:08:58.856 A:middle
supporting frameworks.
