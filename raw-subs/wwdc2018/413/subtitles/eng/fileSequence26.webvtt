00:25:57.736 --> 00:26:01.000 A:middle
io.github.wwdcPhotoFilters.

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:06.626 A:middle
In the documents array, there's

00:26:06.626 --> 00:26:07.996 A:middle
an element for each of the four

00:26:07.996 --> 00:26:09.406 A:middle
documents that we've posted.

00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:13.586 A:middle
And if we look at our first

00:26:13.586 --> 00:26:15.646 A:middle
document the contentIdentifier

00:26:15.646 --> 00:26:17.586 A:middle
matches the feed identifier and

00:26:17.586 --> 00:26:19.000 A:middle
adds the first book's title.

00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:24.146 A:middle
For the URL of the book we have

00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:24.796 A:middle
our website

00:26:25.636 --> 00:26:28.926 A:middle
/IntrotoCI/IntrotoCI.

00:26:29.216 --> 00:26:30.006 A:middle
playgroundbook.zip.

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:31.776 A:middle
And again this is really

00:26:31.776 --> 00:26:33.246 A:middle
important to get right because

00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:34.266 A:middle
it's where Swift Playgrounds

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:35.036 A:middle
will go to download your

00:26:35.036 --> 00:26:35.486 A:middle
content.

00:26:35.486 --> 00:26:40.526 A:middle
The URLs of your images can be

00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:41.466 A:middle
relative URLs.

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:43.086 A:middle
So you only need to include the

00:26:43.086 --> 00:26:44.466 A:middle
folder underneath where your

00:26:44.466 --> 00:26:46.146 A:middle
feed.JSON file is stored and

00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:46.686 A:middle
downwards.

00:26:47.126 --> 00:26:48.206 A:middle
So here I just have

00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:50.316 A:middle
IntrotoCI/thumbnail.png.

00:26:50.316 --> 00:26:52.526 A:middle
And each of the documents in

00:26:52.526 --> 00:26:53.916 A:middle
your subscription should mirror

00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:56.626 A:middle
this format.

00:26:57.176 --> 00:26:58.146 A:middle
Once everything is online,

00:26:58.496 --> 00:26:59.676 A:middle
anyone can subscribe to your

00:26:59.676 --> 00:27:00.006 A:middle
feed.
