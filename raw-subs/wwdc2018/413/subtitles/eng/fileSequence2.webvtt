00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:00.036 A:middle
Playground books are a mechanism

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.706 A:middle
for you to construct a guided

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:03.606 A:middle
interactive exploration of a

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:04.676 A:middle
particular topic.

00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:06.726 A:middle
Using a Playground book you can

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:07.766 A:middle
guide your learners through a

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.425 A:middle
sequence of chapters, which are

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.985 A:middle
then further subdivided into

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:11.566 A:middle
pages.

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:14.046 A:middle
Each page contains a source

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:15.516 A:middle
editor, which you see here on

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:16.026 A:middle
the left.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:17.776 A:middle
And you can also choose to

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:19.956 A:middle
implement an optional, always on

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:22.326 A:middle
live view, which you see here on

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:22.676 A:middle
the right.

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:24.776 A:middle
Live views are used for

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:26.246 A:middle
visualizing the results of

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.416 A:middle
running the code in the source

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:28.586 A:middle
editor on a page.

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.056 A:middle
To bundle all of this into a

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.386 A:middle
single file, we use a package

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.546 A:middle
based file format.

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.226 A:middle
This means that a Playground

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.236 A:middle
book is itself a file hierarchy.

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:43.156 A:middle
It contains a subdirectory for

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:45.416 A:middle
each chapter and nested within

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:47.236 A:middle
each chapter is a folder for

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:48.796 A:middle
each page in that chapter.

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.766 A:middle
And each Playground page folder

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.226 A:middle
contains all of the resources

00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:54.606 A:middle
that are required to run the

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.326 A:middle
code in the source editor and to

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:57.846 A:middle
display the live view for that

00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:58.356 A:middle
page.
