00:20:02.046 --> 00:20:03.396 A:middle
Description is text that should

00:20:03.396 --> 00:20:04.826 A:middle
describe the purpose of your

00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:05.306 A:middle
document.

00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:06.926 A:middle
And it will also show up within

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:07.916 A:middle
Detail Views and Swift

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:08.396 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:12.926 A:middle
contentIdentifier is another

00:20:12.926 --> 00:20:14.506 A:middle
reverse DNS identifier.

00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:16.516 A:middle
It must be unique to the book

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:17.496 A:middle
and it must match the

00:20:17.496 --> 00:20:19.016 A:middle
contentIdentifier within your

00:20:19.016 --> 00:20:20.756 A:middle
books manifest.plistfile.

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:23.026 A:middle
It should start with the feed

00:20:23.026 --> 00:20:24.346 A:middle
identifier of the feed that

00:20:24.346 --> 00:20:25.486 A:middle
contains this book.

00:20:25.656 --> 00:20:26.696 A:middle
So in this example

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:29.486 A:middle
io.github.WWDCPhotoFilters.

00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:32.326 A:middle
You should host your content at

00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:33.636 A:middle
the same place where you host

00:20:33.636 --> 00:20:34.596 A:middle
your feed.JSON file.

00:20:35.126 --> 00:20:36.376 A:middle
But if you don't that's OK,

00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:37.856 A:middle
you'll just need to include a

00:20:37.856 --> 00:20:39.546 A:middle
secure hash of your Zipped

00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:41.046 A:middle
Playground Book as another key.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:42.746 A:middle
And you can learn about this

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:45.000 A:middle
more in the feed format online.

00:20:47.326 --> 00:20:47.726 A:middle
And there's the

00:20:47.726 --> 00:20:48.526 A:middle
contentIdentifier.

00:20:50.776 --> 00:20:52.136 A:middle
Content version is the way that

00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:53.466 A:middle
you can do versioning with your

00:20:53.466 --> 00:20:53.776 A:middle
book.

00:20:54.416 --> 00:20:55.596 A:middle
You need to increment this when

00:20:55.596 --> 00:20:57.156 A:middle
you update your book, and it

00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:58.506 A:middle
always must match the content

00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:01.000 A:middle
version in your book's manifest.
