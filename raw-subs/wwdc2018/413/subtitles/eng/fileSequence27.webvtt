00:26:59.676 --> 00:27:00.006 A:middle
feed.

00:27:00.856 --> 00:27:02.066 A:middle
They could do it by manually

00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.766 A:middle
typing in the URL that points to

00:27:03.766 --> 00:27:06.846 A:middle
your feed.JSON file, or you can

00:27:06.846 --> 00:27:08.366 A:middle
use universal links so that a

00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:10.326 A:middle
user can tap on a link from

00:27:10.326 --> 00:27:12.516 A:middle
within Safari and get redirected

00:27:12.516 --> 00:27:13.366 A:middle
to Swift Playgrounds.

00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:15.756 A:middle
To do that you'll need to

00:27:15.756 --> 00:27:17.556 A:middle
combine the URL for your feed

00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.516 A:middle
and the Universal link prefix

00:27:19.516 --> 00:27:20.636 A:middle
for Swift Playgrounds.

00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:24.276 A:middle
So here's the code for the link

00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:26.106 A:middle
in our index.html file.

00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:28.156 A:middle
I've combined the universal link

00:27:28.236 --> 00:27:28.886 A:middle
prefix,

00:27:29.796 --> 00:27:33.536 A:middle
https/developer.apple.com/ul/ --

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:36.586 A:middle
you get it [laughs], with our

00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:38.226 A:middle
subscription URL.

00:27:39.156 --> 00:27:41.446 A:middle
Then you can imbed that link in

00:27:41.446 --> 00:27:43.326 A:middle
an anchor element with an href

00:27:43.326 --> 00:27:45.046 A:middle
attribute so users can simply

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:47.136 A:middle
tap subscribe and be directed to

00:27:47.136 --> 00:27:48.066 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds.

00:27:49.716 --> 00:27:51.566 A:middle
So next I'd like to demo the

00:27:51.616 --> 00:27:53.306 A:middle
steps that you should take to

00:27:53.306 --> 00:27:54.616 A:middle
add a book to your subscription.

00:27:55.516 --> 00:28:01.926 A:middle
