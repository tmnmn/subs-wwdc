00:31:57.016 --> 00:32:00.256 A:middle
Now Face ID and ARKit are good

00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:02.226 A:middle
examples of features that Apple

00:32:02.226 --> 00:32:04.036 A:middle
has developed that depend on

00:32:04.116 --> 00:32:05.286 A:middle
privacy-friendly machine

00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:07.136 A:middle
learning that you can use in

00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:07.706 A:middle
your apps.

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.096 A:middle
But many of you want more

00:32:10.096 --> 00:32:10.766 A:middle
flexibility.

00:32:12.156 --> 00:32:15.086 A:middle
Create ML and Core ML allow you

00:32:15.436 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
to build your own features on

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:17.996 A:middle
top of machine learning.

00:32:20.356 --> 00:32:23.016 A:middle
With Create ML and Core ML, it

00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:24.676 A:middle
is easier than ever to add

00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:26.816 A:middle
on-device machine learning to

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:27.406 A:middle
your apps.

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.686 A:middle
Create ML allows you to train a

00:32:30.686 --> 00:32:32.286 A:middle
machine learning model directly

00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:35.016 A:middle
on your Mac, and Core ML lets

00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.586 A:middle
you then take this model and

00:32:36.586 --> 00:32:38.446 A:middle
evaluate it directly on a user's

00:32:38.446 --> 00:32:38.936 A:middle
device.

00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:42.206 A:middle
This avoids collecting sensitive

00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:44.376 A:middle
user data to evaluate the model,

00:32:45.136 --> 00:32:46.926 A:middle
and protecting sensitive data on

00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:48.156 A:middle
your servers requires a lot of

00:32:48.156 --> 00:32:48.886 A:middle
engineering work.

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:51.516 A:middle
Evaluating a model on a user's

00:32:51.516 --> 00:32:53.546 A:middle
device can lower your server's

00:32:53.546 --> 00:32:55.296 A:middle
security requirements and will

00:32:55.296 --> 00:32:56.706 A:middle
lower your breach risk as you

00:32:56.706 --> 00:32:58.256 A:middle
don't hold this sensitive

00:32:58.256 --> 00:33:00.036 A:middle
information in the first place.
