00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
your use cases.

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:04.166 A:middle
To illustrate this, let's think

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.886 A:middle
of data collection, the amount

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:06.986 A:middle
and types of data that you

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:07.536 A:middle
gather.

00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:09.846 A:middle
We mentioned earlier those

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:10.576 A:middle
assumptions.

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:11.856 A:middle
You know, you may think

00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:13.366 A:middle
sometimes well shouldn't I just

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.376 A:middle
gather as much data as possible?

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.706 A:middle
Well, you know, in the past you

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:18.856 A:middle
may have hear people call data

00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:20.526 A:middle
the fuel of the new economy.

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:24.416 A:middle
Like actual fuel, data should be

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:25.726 A:middle
handled with caution.

00:06:27.316 --> 00:06:29.606 A:middle
Because data is very powerful,

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:30.796 A:middle
and that unlocks a lot of great

00:06:30.796 --> 00:06:32.866 A:middle
use cases, but because it's so

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.576 A:middle
powerful, it can also be

00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:36.596 A:middle
dangerous if not handled

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.166 A:middle
carefully.

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:40.926 A:middle
Gathering data creates overhead

00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:41.636 A:middle
for you as an engineer.

00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:43.806 A:middle
You're going to need to spend

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.596 A:middle
time and resources managing that

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:47.696 A:middle
data, keeping up with it,

00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:48.376 A:middle
filtering it.

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:49.746 A:middle
It's time you could be spending

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:51.506 A:middle
working on new features for your

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:52.126 A:middle
users.

00:06:53.156 --> 00:06:55.316 A:middle
It also creates liabilities.

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:57.376 A:middle
We've all heard about companies

00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:58.766 A:middle
suffering data breaches, which

00:06:58.766 --> 00:06:59.966 A:middle
is a bad situation.
