00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:00.736 A:middle
only time that a user gets to

00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:02.846 A:middle
understand how their data is

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:03.666 A:middle
being used.

00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:05.616 A:middle
You can do this in a privacy

00:18:05.616 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
policy, which is required for

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.746 A:middle
apps in the App Store, or

00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:09.876 A:middle
throughout your app you can

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:11.506 A:middle
provide links and documentation

00:18:11.676 --> 00:18:13.606 A:middle
to help users understand how

00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:14.676 A:middle
their data is being used.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:18.356 A:middle
Now this is all broader guidance

00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:21.026 A:middle
around these kinds of APIs, but

00:18:21.026 --> 00:18:22.206 A:middle
there's a few specific ones I

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:23.786 A:middle
want to highlight with changes

00:18:23.786 --> 00:18:24.276 A:middle
this year.

00:18:24.766 --> 00:18:26.706 A:middle
The first is for WiFi network

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:27.406 A:middle
information.

00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:29.546 A:middle
If your app uses see and copy

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:30.946 A:middle
current network info, you're

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.236 A:middle
going to need to add an

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.046 A:middle
entitlement,

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:35.566 A:middle
AccessWiFiInformation in Xcode.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.996 A:middle
This is a capability that you

00:18:37.996 --> 00:18:39.076 A:middle
can enable for your app.

00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:41.666 A:middle
For example, if your app is

00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:42.746 A:middle
communicating with a hardware

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.236 A:middle
accessory and needs to verify if

00:18:44.236 --> 00:18:46.066 A:middle
they're on the same network, you

00:18:46.066 --> 00:18:46.746 A:middle
would need this.

00:18:47.296 --> 00:18:48.246 A:middle
If you're not doing that use

00:18:48.246 --> 00:18:49.576 A:middle
case, you don't need to worry

00:18:49.576 --> 00:18:50.196 A:middle
about this.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:51.536 A:middle
This is only if it's necessary

00:18:51.536 --> 00:18:52.606 A:middle
for the functionality of your

00:18:52.606 --> 00:18:52.856 A:middle
app.

00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:55.386 A:middle
You may have also heard about

00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:56.746 A:middle
our new Health Records API.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:18:59.096 A:middle
Because we know that developers

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.686 A:middle
have a lot of great ideas around
