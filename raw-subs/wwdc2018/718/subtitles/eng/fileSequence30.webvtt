or third-party customer support

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:01.446 A:middle
integrations.

00:30:01.916 --> 00:30:04.776 A:middle
Being a good data steward means

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.956 A:middle
taking responsibility for the

00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:09.226 A:middle
full picture and considering

00:30:09.226 --> 00:30:10.536 A:middle
privacy when considering

00:30:10.616 --> 00:30:11.556 A:middle
partners to work with.

00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:15.466 A:middle
Now for a topic you may have

00:30:15.466 --> 00:30:16.266 A:middle
heard a little bit about,

00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:17.056 A:middle
machine learning.

00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:20.216 A:middle
So across the industry, much of

00:30:20.216 --> 00:30:21.476 A:middle
the talk about machine learning

00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:23.596 A:middle
centers around the performance

00:30:23.596 --> 00:30:24.846 A:middle
characteristics of a new

00:30:24.846 --> 00:30:26.976 A:middle
algorithm or the power of a

00:30:26.976 --> 00:30:27.936 A:middle
cloud-based solution.

00:30:28.866 --> 00:30:30.246 A:middle
And while these are important

00:30:30.246 --> 00:30:32.516 A:middle
technical developments, as Tim

00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:33.416 A:middle
said in his commencement

00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:35.776 A:middle
address, the question that we

00:30:35.776 --> 00:30:37.706 A:middle
ask is not what can we do but

00:30:38.366 --> 00:30:38.976 A:middle
what should we do.

00:30:40.206 --> 00:30:42.346 A:middle
Now this applies particularly to

00:30:42.346 --> 00:30:44.256 A:middle
machine learning, and we've been

00:30:44.256 --> 00:30:45.646 A:middle
working on it for years.

00:30:47.496 --> 00:30:49.236 A:middle
Face ID was built with

00:30:49.366 --> 00:30:50.936 A:middle
privacy-friendly machine

00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:51.976 A:middle
learning at its core.

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.896 A:middle
And we've made it easy for you

00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:57.336 A:middle
to add Face ID authentication to

00:30:57.336 --> 00:30:58.496 A:middle
your apps using the

00:30:58.496 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
LocalAuthentication API.
