00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
The second is to keep your model

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:04.296 A:middle
complexity proportional to the

00:35:04.296 --> 00:35:05.266 A:middle
goal that you are trying to

00:35:05.266 --> 00:35:05.636 A:middle
solve.

00:35:07.146 --> 00:35:08.436 A:middle
Both of these techniques can

00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:11.146 A:middle
prevent model overfitting, which

00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:12.916 A:middle
makes a model inversion or

00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:14.316 A:middle
unexpected inference more

00:35:14.316 --> 00:35:14.706 A:middle
likely.

00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:17.936 A:middle
Now at Apple, we believe that

00:35:17.936 --> 00:35:19.426 A:middle
considering questions like these

00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.326 A:middle
are an important part of

00:35:21.326 --> 00:35:22.736 A:middle
building products that users can

00:35:22.736 --> 00:35:23.116 A:middle
trust.

00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:27.286 A:middle
Because fundamentally privacy is

00:35:27.286 --> 00:35:27.986 A:middle
about people.

00:35:29.386 --> 00:35:31.226 A:middle
It's about building trust with

00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:33.586 A:middle
your users and respecting your

00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:35.286 A:middle
users in handling their data.

00:35:36.636 --> 00:35:38.276 A:middle
By applying the techniques that

00:35:38.276 --> 00:35:39.086 A:middle
we've gone over in this

00:35:39.086 --> 00:35:41.656 A:middle
presentation, you too can build

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:44.516 A:middle
products with great features and

00:35:44.786 --> 00:35:45.776 A:middle
great privacy.

00:35:46.286 --> 00:35:49.406 A:middle
Now in summary, I hope you take

00:35:49.406 --> 00:35:51.046 A:middle
away three big ideas about

00:35:51.046 --> 00:35:51.546 A:middle
privacy.

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:53.886 A:middle
That privacy is about people,

00:35:54.546 --> 00:35:56.456 A:middle
that you have to ask the should

00:35:56.456 --> 00:35:58.406 A:middle
questions, and that you should

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.196 A:middle
align your data practices with
