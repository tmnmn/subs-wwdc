00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.096 A:middle
share some features that Apple

00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:01.366 A:middle
has built where we've this kind

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
of thinking.

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:05.146 A:middle
First is activity sharing where

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.466 A:middle
you can share fitness data with

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.176 A:middle
your friends.

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.376 A:middle
Now for me as a privacy

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.246 A:middle
engineer, I like to turn all of

00:10:11.246 --> 00:10:12.856 A:middle
these sliders up to 100 percent

00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:15.106 A:middle
as much as possible, but that's

00:10:15.106 --> 00:10:16.426 A:middle
not always feasible for a given

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:16.946 A:middle
feature.

00:10:17.406 --> 00:10:18.956 A:middle
In this case, you're sharing

00:10:18.956 --> 00:10:21.186 A:middle
data with friends, so they know

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:21.626 A:middle
your name.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.646 A:middle
They know whose data it is.

00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:24.906 A:middle
So you can't just make this data

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:25.846 A:middle
de-identified.

00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:27.636 A:middle
It's already very identifiable

00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:28.706 A:middle
as part of the use case.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:31.556 A:middle
Consequently, we turn up other

00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
privacy techniques like only

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:34.326 A:middle
showing a summary of the data,

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.236 A:middle
not minute-by-minute statistics

00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:37.756 A:middle
or the exact location of your

00:10:38.396 --> 00:10:38.716 A:middle
run.

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.176 A:middle
We also provide a lot of control

00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:41.536 A:middle
over who you share with and

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:41.906 A:middle
when.

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:45.716 A:middle
Now, in the Apple News app, we

00:10:45.716 --> 00:10:47.496 A:middle
collect analytics data using a

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:49.126 A:middle
scoped identifier that's not

00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:50.816 A:middle
connected to your Apple ID.

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:53.246 A:middle
That gives us more flexibility

00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:54.486 A:middle
around the precision of data we

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.666 A:middle
collect, but since it's still

00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:58.006 A:middle
sensitive information, we still

00:10:58.006 --> 00:10:59.416 A:middle
provide control through things

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:00.896 A:middle
like being able to reset that
