00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:01.396 A:middle
specific, provide an example.

00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:04.326 A:middle
Some additional guidelines to

00:17:04.326 --> 00:17:05.276 A:middle
remember when you're working

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:06.736 A:middle
with protected resources on a

00:17:06.736 --> 00:17:07.266 A:middle
device.

00:17:08.076 --> 00:17:09.596 A:middle
Access should not be required

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:10.915 A:middle
for your app to function.

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:12.715 A:middle
Again, this can lead to

00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:14.556 A:middle
rejections in the app review

00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:15.326 A:middle
process.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:17.856 A:middle
Your app should have graceful

00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:19.925 A:middle
fallback mechanisms so that even

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.465 A:middle
if a user declines access, it

00:17:21.465 --> 00:17:22.465 A:middle
still functions.

00:17:23.056 --> 00:17:24.356 A:middle
For example, with that transit

00:17:24.356 --> 00:17:26.266 A:middle
app, if the user denies location

00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:27.906 A:middle
access, you can have a field

00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:29.026 A:middle
where they can enter location

00:17:29.026 --> 00:17:30.786 A:middle
manually and use that instead.

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:33.586 A:middle
Again, you want to verify the

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.176 A:middle
authorization status of your app

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:37.046 A:middle
whenever it needs this data to

00:17:37.046 --> 00:17:38.776 A:middle
make sure that the user still is

00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:41.106 A:middle
getting access, and stay aware

00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:43.006 A:middle
of third-part STKs.

00:17:43.566 --> 00:17:45.136 A:middle
Again, requesting access should

00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:46.546 A:middle
only be for the use cases of

00:17:46.546 --> 00:17:48.336 A:middle
your app, and if you're

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:49.656 A:middle
including libraries that change

00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:50.726 A:middle
that or tell you to set purpose

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:52.226 A:middle
strings, you should probably

00:17:52.226 --> 00:17:53.686 A:middle
look for a different solution or

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:55.026 A:middle
update your code.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:56.886 A:middle
Finally, you want to provide

00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.106 A:middle
ongoing transparency.

00:17:58.106 --> 00:17:59.326 A:middle
Again, this should not be the

00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:00.736 A:middle
only time that a user gets to
