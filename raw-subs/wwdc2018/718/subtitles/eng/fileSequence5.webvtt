00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:01.796 A:middle
privacy is so much more than

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:02.106 A:middle
that.

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:04.276 A:middle
Because this again doesn't get

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:06.306 A:middle
back to the should questions of

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.116 A:middle
should we even have this data at

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:08.596 A:middle
all.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.926 A:middle
Now as you're asking questions

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:13.146 A:middle
about the data flows in your

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.576 A:middle
app, if you want to even go one

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:16.726 A:middle
step further, you can create

00:05:16.726 --> 00:05:18.376 A:middle
privacy guarantees.

00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:20.936 A:middle
These are high-level statements

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.646 A:middle
about the privacy expectations

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:24.226 A:middle
in your app that you want to be

00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:24.766 A:middle
able to make.

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:27.986 A:middle
And by establishing these early

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:29.886 A:middle
on in the development process,

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:32.396 A:middle
it provides a framework to guide

00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:33.316 A:middle
you as you're building your

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:35.216 A:middle
features and something to test

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:36.926 A:middle
against once you're done.

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:39.966 A:middle
There's some examples on the

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.256 A:middle
screen here of these kinds of

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:42.326 A:middle
statements that are similar to

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.416 A:middle
statements Apple has made about

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:46.436 A:middle
some of our features, and

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.866 A:middle
there's many options for

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:50.436 A:middle
implementing each of these,

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:54.516 A:middle
which brings me to the third big

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:54.946 A:middle
idea.

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:58.956 A:middle
Align your data practices with

00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
your use cases.
