00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.436 A:middle
we can all fall prey to

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.326 A:middle
assumptions about our data.

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:06.946 A:middle
So just thinking, we should just

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:07.976 A:middle
log this for everyone.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:10.156 A:middle
Maybe that's the way we've

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:12.526 A:middle
always done it in the past or

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:14.306 A:middle
the way others do it, but again,

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:15.726 A:middle
is it really necessary for what

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:16.966 A:middle
we're trying to accomplish?

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.065 A:middle
Or you might think that data

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.696 A:middle
couldn't possibly be sensitive

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.046 A:middle
in the context you're working,

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:26.656 A:middle
but maybe that data is very

00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:28.506 A:middle
sensitive in a different context

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.316 A:middle
or for users in a vulnerable

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:30.976 A:middle
population.

00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:34.446 A:middle
If you're taking data that was

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.956 A:middle
gathered for one purpose and

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.196 A:middle
apply it in a new way, would

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:41.126 A:middle
users understand or expect that?

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:44.096 A:middle
You also hear people talk about

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:45.376 A:middle
personally identifiable

00:04:45.376 --> 00:04:48.436 A:middle
information, or PII, but even

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:49.996 A:middle
data that falls outside that

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:51.306 A:middle
definition can still have a

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:52.416 A:middle
privacy impact.

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:55.926 A:middle
Just like if you're protecting

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.226 A:middle
data with encryption and good

00:04:57.226 --> 00:04:59.876 A:middle
security, that's wonderful, but

00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:01.796 A:middle
privacy is so much more than
