00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:01.236 A:middle
cookies will be purged entirely.

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:05.346 A:middle
Now importantly here, access via

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:07.466 A:middle
the Storage Access API will

00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:09.296 A:middle
count towards this 30-day

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:10.176 A:middle
interaction timer.

00:24:11.196 --> 00:24:12.316 A:middle
That means that users who

00:24:12.346 --> 00:24:13.626 A:middle
interact frequently with your

00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:15.786 A:middle
site in a third-party context

00:24:16.016 --> 00:24:17.026 A:middle
will stay logged in.

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:20.576 A:middle
So in this sequence, the user

00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:23.166 A:middle
will visit video.example both in

00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.956 A:middle
a first-party context, logged

00:24:24.956 --> 00:24:26.806 A:middle
into the home page, and in a

00:24:26.806 --> 00:24:28.456 A:middle
third-party context, where it's

00:24:28.456 --> 00:24:30.206 A:middle
embedded across the web.

00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:32.946 A:middle
So first, the user visits the

00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:34.736 A:middle
site in a first-party context.

00:24:35.606 --> 00:24:37.416 A:middle
Now notice that the days since

00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:39.206 A:middle
interaction timer will read zero

00:24:39.296 --> 00:24:40.856 A:middle
as the user is currently

00:24:40.856 --> 00:24:41.796 A:middle
interacting with the site.

00:24:43.476 --> 00:24:45.566 A:middle
But as the user interacts with

00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:47.166 A:middle
the embedded content throughout

00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:50.406 A:middle
their web browsing, the timer

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:51.046 A:middle
will update.

00:24:52.466 --> 00:24:53.886 A:middle
This means that when the user

00:24:53.886 --> 00:24:56.146 A:middle
returns in a first-party

00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.316 A:middle
context, the days since

00:24:58.316 --> 00:25:00.426 A:middle
interaction timer will read 5
