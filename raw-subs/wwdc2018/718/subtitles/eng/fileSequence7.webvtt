00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:02.166 A:middle
But if the data that gets leaked

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.876 A:middle
includes information that's not

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:06.626 A:middle
relevant to the use case, that's

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.456 A:middle
an even worse situation.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
Unexpected data collection

00:07:11.626 --> 00:07:13.536 A:middle
creates all sorts of risks.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.846 A:middle
And it destroys that foundation

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.666 A:middle
of trust with your users.

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.086 A:middle
The next time you think about

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:21.386 A:middle
gathering as much data as

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:23.926 A:middle
possible, I want you to picture

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:26.236 A:middle
these tanks of chemicals and

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:27.816 A:middle
remember your responsibility to

00:07:27.816 --> 00:07:30.036 A:middle
your users to handle their data

00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:32.306 A:middle
carefully and thoughtfully.

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:34.726 A:middle
Instead, you want to practice

00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:38.206 A:middle
what we call proportional data

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:38.686 A:middle
collection.

00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:41.396 A:middle
This is the idea of collecting

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:43.246 A:middle
only what's necessary to achieve

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.196 A:middle
your goal, and again sometimes

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:46.326 A:middle
you might start off thinking

00:07:46.326 --> 00:07:47.186 A:middle
that you need a lot of

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
information when a different

00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:50.106 A:middle
dataset may suffice.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:52.366 A:middle
You can even start with the

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:53.946 A:middle
assumption of no data and figure

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:55.726 A:middle
out what's actually necessary

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:56.936 A:middle
for what you're trying to solve.

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.006 A:middle
This gets back to user
