00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.216 A:middle
we get into this year's updates.

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:02.236 A:middle
Because we're going to talk a

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:05.536 A:middle
lot about data privacy, but we

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.716 A:middle
can never forget that data is

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:08.996 A:middle
about people.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:11.196 A:middle
It belongs to them.

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.616 A:middle
So when I say that privacy is

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
about people, I mean it's about

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.166 A:middle
building a relationship of trust

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:20.586 A:middle
with your users.

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.096 A:middle
This lays a foundation for

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:26.206 A:middle
better engagement, which leads

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:27.046 A:middle
to better apps.

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:29.826 A:middle
Think about other relationships.

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:31.596 A:middle
It's the people that you trust

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:33.676 A:middle
that you're more likely to work

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.056 A:middle
with and spend time with.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.076 A:middle
And as your users understand why

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.636 A:middle
you're collecting data, how it's

00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:44.256 A:middle
being used, as you handle that

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:45.716 A:middle
data respectfully and

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.946 A:middle
thoughtfully, you're going to

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:50.416 A:middle
get better data, because they're

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:51.506 A:middle
going to be more comfortable

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.076 A:middle
using your apps and sharing

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.006 A:middle
information, and this builds

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:57.316 A:middle
loyalty over time.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:02.446 A:middle
And I start here because I want
