00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.776 A:middle
Even this last one about more

00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:03.286 A:middle
relevant content, that's nice,

00:16:03.316 --> 00:16:05.066 A:middle
but it's pretty vague.

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
And when you look at our own

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:09.376 A:middle
maps app, when it requests

00:16:09.376 --> 00:16:11.156 A:middle
location, this is what you see.

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:12.806 A:middle
It will be displayed on the map

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:14.676 A:middle
and used for directions, nearby

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:15.816 A:middle
search results, and travel

00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:16.406 A:middle
times.

00:16:17.356 --> 00:16:19.046 A:middle
So this is explaining the reason

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:21.116 A:middle
the use case for this request.

00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:24.666 A:middle
It's specific, includes examples

00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:26.206 A:middle
of how the data will be used.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.696 A:middle
The TV app also, this is another

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:31.446 A:middle
one that Apple wrote using your

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:32.566 A:middle
location to determine what's

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:34.136 A:middle
available to you and show you

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.716 A:middle
live games, events, and news

00:16:35.716 --> 00:16:37.066 A:middle
from your area.

00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:39.396 A:middle
Remember, if users understand

00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:41.136 A:middle
why they're being asked for this

00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:42.206 A:middle
data, they're going to be more

00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:44.596 A:middle
likely to allow it.

00:16:44.726 --> 00:16:45.946 A:middle
If you were building a transit

00:16:45.946 --> 00:16:47.296 A:middle
app for a subway system, you

00:16:47.596 --> 00:16:48.876 A:middle
might write something like this.

00:16:49.146 --> 00:16:50.856 A:middle
This app uses your location to

00:16:50.856 --> 00:16:52.486 A:middle
show nearby stops and stations

00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:54.106 A:middle
and allows you to plan trips

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:55.206 A:middle
from your current location.

00:16:56.596 --> 00:16:59.056 A:middle
Again, explain the use case, be

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:01.396 A:middle
specific, provide an example.
