My name is Joey Tyson.

I'm a privacy engineer at Apple,

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:39.336 A:middle
and I know you've heard a lot of

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.876 A:middle
great information this week on

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.066 A:middle
exciting new features and you're

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.506 A:middle
ready to get out there and build

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:47.066 A:middle
some new apps, but I know you

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.206 A:middle
also care deeply about your

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:50.246 A:middle
user's privacy.

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.806 A:middle
And this is the first of three

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.366 A:middle
big ideas I want to explore with

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.676 A:middle
you about privacy today before

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.216 A:middle
