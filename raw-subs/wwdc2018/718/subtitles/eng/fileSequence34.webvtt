00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.066 A:middle
learn more about in the paper

00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:03.936 A:middle
that I've put on this slide.

00:34:04.446 --> 00:34:07.076 A:middle
Similarly, you should ask, could

00:34:07.076 --> 00:34:09.576 A:middle
I infer more about my users than

00:34:09.576 --> 00:34:10.196 A:middle
they expected?

00:34:11.306 --> 00:34:13.456 A:middle
So users might expect that you'd

00:34:13.456 --> 00:34:15.616 A:middle
classify activity type via

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:16.146 A:middle
sensor data.

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.356 A:middle
But you should ask, did I

00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:21.136 A:middle
accidentally encode the fact

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.235 A:middle
that this specific user uses a

00:34:23.235 --> 00:34:23.746 A:middle
wheelchair?

00:34:24.255 --> 00:34:26.206 A:middle
It could be great to offer a

00:34:26.206 --> 00:34:27.406 A:middle
feature for wheelchair users,

00:34:28.436 --> 00:34:30.366 A:middle
but this should be clear and

00:34:30.366 --> 00:34:31.156 A:middle
sold as a feature.

00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:34.126 A:middle
As with general data collection,

00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:36.606 A:middle
you should obtain new consent if

00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:38.396 A:middle
you have a new use case enabled

00:34:38.396 --> 00:34:39.246 A:middle
by machine learning.

00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:42.746 A:middle
Now it turns out that two small

00:34:42.746 --> 00:34:44.516 A:middle
modifications can help mitigate

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:45.556 A:middle
both of these issues.

00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:48.866 A:middle
The first is to ensure that you

00:34:48.866 --> 00:34:50.565 A:middle
train on the right data.

00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:53.146 A:middle
This means training on a

00:34:53.146 --> 00:34:55.516 A:middle
sufficient quantity of diverse

00:34:55.516 --> 00:34:57.646 A:middle
inputs that were collected with

00:34:57.646 --> 00:34:58.546 A:middle
the proper consent.

00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
The second is to keep your model
