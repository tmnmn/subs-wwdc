00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:03.306 A:middle
No matter what your role,

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:05.006 A:middle
whether you're a solo app

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:06.656 A:middle
developer or part of a large

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:09.606 A:middle
organization, you can be the one

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:12.016 A:middle
to stand up for your users.

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.016 A:middle
Remember your responsibility

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.536 A:middle
towards them, and ask questions

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:18.286 A:middle
about the data flows in your

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:19.346 A:middle
app.

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:23.646 A:middle
For example, why do we actually

00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:24.296 A:middle
need this data?

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.256 A:middle
This isn't merely an accusation.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:28.606 A:middle
It's to think about is this

00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:31.236 A:middle
necessary for our use case?

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:32.836 A:middle
Should we collect it?

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:36.196 A:middle
Would this surprise our users?

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:38.876 A:middle
If people understood this and it

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:41.076 A:middle
scared them, why should we be

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:41.916 A:middle
doing it at all?

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:45.226 A:middle
Could we use less granular data,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:46.476 A:middle
less precise?

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:48.656 A:middle
Are there other approaches we

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:49.466 A:middle
should consider?

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.316 A:middle
And should we delete or

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:53.876 A:middle
aggregate this data after a

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:54.766 A:middle
period of time?

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.046 A:middle
Part of the reason for asking

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.646 A:middle
these kinds of questions is that

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.436 A:middle
we can all fall prey to
