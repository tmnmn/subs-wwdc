00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:02.446 A:middle
And I start here because I want

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:04.676 A:middle
you to apply this context to

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:06.596 A:middle
your development process.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:09.816 A:middle
None of us do engineering in

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:12.746 A:middle
isolation, so whether you're

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:15.056 A:middle
working with health records or

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:16.266 A:middle
just building a simple puzzle

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.136 A:middle
game, the information you gather

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:21.096 A:middle
and the ways that you use it

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:23.896 A:middle
could have a very real impact on

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:24.956 A:middle
people's lives.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:28.186 A:middle
So it's critical for each of us

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:29.846 A:middle
to think carefully about the

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:30.856 A:middle
technologies that we're

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:31.486 A:middle
building.

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:34.956 A:middle
In a recent commencement address

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:37.556 A:middle
at Duke University, Tim Cook

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.136 A:middle
talked about Apple's approach to

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:41.846 A:middle
privacy, and he said that "In

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:44.196 A:middle
every way, at every turn, the

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.646 A:middle
question we ask ourselves is not

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:49.906 A:middle
what can we do, but what should

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:50.396 A:middle
we do."

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:54.566 A:middle
And that leads me to the second

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:58.606 A:middle
big idea, ask the "should"

00:02:58.826 --> 00:02:59.696 A:middle
questions.
