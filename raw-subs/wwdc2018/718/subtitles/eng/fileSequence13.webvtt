00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
This is a case where because

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:01.856 A:middle
this doesn't involve ongoing

00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:03.846 A:middle
access to the entire library,

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:06.376 A:middle
the user has control by picking

00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:08.266 A:middle
what they share, so we don't

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:09.596 A:middle
need to show a permission prompt

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:11.366 A:middle
and ask them to make a decision

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:13.066 A:middle
about future access.

00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:16.976 A:middle
This is the default method for

00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:18.696 A:middle
accessing contacts, camera, and

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:19.586 A:middle
photos data.

00:13:20.856 --> 00:13:22.176 A:middle
There are going to be times

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.446 A:middle
where you may need access to the

00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:24.706 A:middle
broader library, but in most

00:13:24.706 --> 00:13:26.296 A:middle
situations, you'll find that

00:13:26.296 --> 00:13:27.936 A:middle
this works great for a whole lot

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:29.186 A:middle
of apps.

00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:33.356 A:middle
This is a case where it does

00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:34.776 A:middle
just work and only requires a

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:35.816 A:middle
few lines of code.

00:13:36.206 --> 00:13:37.326 A:middle
You can see some snippets here

00:13:37.326 --> 00:13:39.116 A:middle
for how to call these pickers in

00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:39.796 A:middle
your app.

00:13:40.656 --> 00:13:42.076 A:middle
Now as I said, there are going

00:13:42.076 --> 00:13:43.176 A:middle
to be some times where you do

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:44.766 A:middle
need access to the broader data,

00:13:44.856 --> 00:13:46.026 A:middle
and as you know, there's a

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.726 A:middle
variety of protected resources

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:50.686 A:middle
available on the device, but if

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:52.426 A:middle
you're using one of these APIs,

00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.256 A:middle
you need to keep in mind three

00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:55.336 A:middle
things before you start

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.646 A:middle
requesting access.

00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.646 A:middle
You should only request access
