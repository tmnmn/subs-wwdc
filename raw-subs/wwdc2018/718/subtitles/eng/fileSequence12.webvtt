00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:00.046 A:middle
your app.

00:12:00.546 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
And these fall into two general

00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:03.866 A:middle
categories of accessing user

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:05.986 A:middle
data and more broadly, data

00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:06.656 A:middle
stewardship.

00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:09.776 A:middle
So for data access, let's start

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:12.336 A:middle
by talking about iOS, and much

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:13.656 A:middle
of this guidance will apply to

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:15.666 A:middle
tvOS and watchOS as well.

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:18.576 A:middle
Let's imagine you're building a

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:20.266 A:middle
game for iOS where players can

00:12:20.266 --> 00:12:21.916 A:middle
compete against each other, and

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:22.746 A:middle
you want them to be able to

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:24.256 A:middle
upload a photo to identify

00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:24.896 A:middle
themselves.

00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:26.716 A:middle
Now we've all seen those

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.276 A:middle
permission prompts for access to

00:12:28.276 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
photos, but wouldn't it be great

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:31.416 A:middle
if we could just have the user

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
click a button, select a

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:34.436 A:middle
picture, and have it appear

00:12:34.436 --> 00:12:36.646 A:middle
immediately in their app?

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:39.006 A:middle
Well, you can already do this

00:12:39.006 --> 00:12:39.396 A:middle
today.

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:41.796 A:middle
Because we have a feature

00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:43.366 A:middle
available called out-of-process

00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:45.056 A:middle
pickers for contacts, camera,

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.646 A:middle
and photos data, where the

00:12:47.646 --> 00:12:49.356 A:middle
picker that appears runs outside

00:12:49.356 --> 00:12:51.476 A:middle
your apps process so the only

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:52.786 A:middle
information that's shared back

00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:54.396 A:middle
with the app is what the user

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:55.096 A:middle
selects.

00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:57.916 A:middle
We talked about those privacy

00:12:57.916 --> 00:12:58.516 A:middle
techniques.

00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
This is a case where because
