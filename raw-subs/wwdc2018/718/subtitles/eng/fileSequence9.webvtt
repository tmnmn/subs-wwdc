00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
Even more advanced techniques

00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:02.646 A:middle
like differential privacy.

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:05.166 A:middle
I don't have time today to go

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.396 A:middle
into the entire list of

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:08.476 A:middle
techniques available, but what I

00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:10.116 A:middle
want to focus on now is the idea

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:12.396 A:middle
of adjusting these to match your

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:13.216 A:middle
use case.

00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:15.986 A:middle
You can think of a mixing board

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:16.676 A:middle
for music.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:18.556 A:middle
If you have one track that's

00:09:18.556 --> 00:09:20.696 A:middle
particularly loud or soft, you

00:09:20.696 --> 00:09:22.366 A:middle
may need to adjust others to

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.956 A:middle
balance things out and achieve a

00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:24.686 A:middle
good mix.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:27.686 A:middle
And again, there will be times

00:09:27.686 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
when you do need to collect a

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:30.626 A:middle
lot of data for a particular

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.986 A:middle
feature, but in those cases, you

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:34.636 A:middle
want to make sure you adjust

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.946 A:middle
those privacy techniques to

00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:38.396 A:middle
create a great experience for

00:09:38.396 --> 00:09:39.156 A:middle
your users.

00:09:40.416 --> 00:09:42.456 A:middle
Ideally, these apply across all

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:44.086 A:middle
systems where the data lives so

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:45.626 A:middle
those privacy guarantees stay

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:47.796 A:middle
consistent and are billed as

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.276 A:middle
technical enforcement rather

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.526 A:middle
than just policy statements

00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:52.396 A:middle
about what you plan to do.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.316 A:middle
But I know this can all be a

00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:56.996 A:middle
little abstract, so to

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.766 A:middle
illustrate further, I want to

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.096 A:middle
share some features that Apple
