00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.936 A:middle
Also, for Safari, since last

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:03.126 A:middle
year, we've added the ability

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:04.716 A:middle
for those devices to donate data

00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:06.946 A:middle
around websites that typically

00:20:06.946 --> 00:20:08.816 A:middle
cause crashes to improve the

00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:09.956 A:middle
stability of the browser.

00:20:10.456 --> 00:20:12.226 A:middle
So that's iOS.

00:20:12.226 --> 00:20:14.176 A:middle
Let's talk for a moment about

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.256 A:middle
macOS as well.

00:20:15.606 --> 00:20:17.086 A:middle
Because as you may have heard,

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:18.766 A:middle
we've made some changes to how

00:20:18.766 --> 00:20:20.356 A:middle
protected resources are handled

00:20:20.356 --> 00:20:21.236 A:middle
on macOS.

00:20:22.136 --> 00:20:23.206 A:middle
It's an expanded list of

00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:24.546 A:middle
categories of data where there

00:20:24.886 --> 00:20:26.576 A:middle
are protections in place, and

00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:27.546 A:middle
these can now trigger a

00:20:27.546 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
permission prompt or for some of

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.056 A:middle
these an opt-in through system

00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:31.776 A:middle
preferences.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.076 A:middle
I just want to highlight this so

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:35.136 A:middle
that if you're developing for

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:37.246 A:middle
the Mac, I want you to be aware

00:20:37.246 --> 00:20:38.716 A:middle
of some of these changes because

00:20:38.716 --> 00:20:39.706 A:middle
you need to know how they're

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:41.176 A:middle
going to affect your app if

00:20:41.176 --> 00:20:42.056 A:middle
you're accessing these

00:20:42.056 --> 00:20:42.816 A:middle
resources.

00:20:43.896 --> 00:20:45.416 A:middle
Again, since these can trigger a

00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:46.486 A:middle
permission prompt, you want to

00:20:46.486 --> 00:20:47.906 A:middle
know when that's going to happen

00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:49.446 A:middle
so your users aren't surprised,

00:20:50.136 --> 00:20:51.786 A:middle
and please note, this applies to

00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:54.006 A:middle
all third-party app processes

00:20:54.346 --> 00:20:56.666 A:middle
including those outside of the

00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:58.276 A:middle
app store.

00:20:58.496 --> 00:20:59.746 A:middle
Just like with iOS, you'll need

00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:00.886 A:middle
to set a purpose string for
