00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.006 A:middle
This gets back to user

00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
expectations.

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.286 A:middle
People should understand why

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:05.676 A:middle
you're collecting data and how

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:06.446 A:middle
you're using it.

00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:07.986 A:middle
It should be in line with what

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:08.566 A:middle
they expect.

00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:10.656 A:middle
You should always be able to

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:13.206 A:middle
provide a clear rationale for

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.296 A:middle
the use cases that you're

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:14.816 A:middle
building.

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:18.356 A:middle
But of course, this is about

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:19.486 A:middle
data collection, but when we

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:20.746 A:middle
talk about aligning data

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:22.866 A:middle
practices with use cases, that

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:24.596 A:middle
extends to the entire data life

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:27.036 A:middle
cycle and being good stewards of

00:08:27.036 --> 00:08:28.376 A:middle
the information that's been

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:29.296 A:middle
entrusted to you.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:32.426 A:middle
So even beyond just proportional

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:33.796 A:middle
data collection, you want to

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.265 A:middle
develop and use privacy

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.226 A:middle
techniques throughout your app's

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:38.806 A:middle
workflow.

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.626 A:middle
You could develop a whole

00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:43.686 A:middle
toolbox or repertoire of

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.466 A:middle
techniques that will help you

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:47.026 A:middle
build privacy into your app.

00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:49.546 A:middle
Things like aggregation,

00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:52.426 A:middle
providing transparency to users,

00:08:53.126 --> 00:08:54.806 A:middle
using a scoped identifier

00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:56.256 A:middle
instead of a real identity,

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.336 A:middle
automatically rotating those

00:08:58.336 --> 00:08:58.926 A:middle
with time.

00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
Even more advanced techniques
