00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.686 A:middle
have a lot of great ideas around

00:19:00.686 --> 00:19:02.156 A:middle
building apps using health data,

00:19:02.626 --> 00:19:03.916 A:middle
but we also recognize that's

00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:05.626 A:middle
very sensitive information.

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:08.046 A:middle
So again, adjusting those

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.846 A:middle
privacy techniques rather than

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:11.156 A:middle
just a simple permission prompt,

00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:12.386 A:middle
we provide a greater

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.866 A:middle
transparency and control for the

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:14.316 A:middle
user.

00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.166 A:middle
You can see there's a purpose

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.726 A:middle
string, a link to a privacy

00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:18.706 A:middle
policy, which should be a

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:20.226 A:middle
website or if it's in your app

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:21.486 A:middle
available while signed out.

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:23.676 A:middle
There's also controls over what

00:19:23.676 --> 00:19:25.076 A:middle
categories of data to share,

00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:26.266 A:middle
whether it's current or current

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:28.156 A:middle
and future data, and there's a

00:19:28.156 --> 00:19:29.256 A:middle
session from Tuesday you can

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:30.536 A:middle
refer to that provides a lot

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.926 A:middle
more information about how to

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:34.026 A:middle
use this API in your app.

00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:37.226 A:middle
Finally, for iOS, I wanted to

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:38.476 A:middle
share a quick update on how

00:19:38.476 --> 00:19:39.816 A:middle
Apple's been using the technique

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:41.526 A:middle
of differential privacy to

00:19:41.526 --> 00:19:43.136 A:middle
improve our apps and devices.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.686 A:middle
The first new use case this year

00:19:45.686 --> 00:19:46.796 A:middle
is for commonly misspelled

00:19:46.796 --> 00:19:47.446 A:middle
words.

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:49.056 A:middle
If you're typing and correct

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:51.166 A:middle
yourself, devices that are opted

00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:52.666 A:middle
in to device analytics will now

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
donate data on those words to

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:55.706 A:middle
help us improve our keyboard

00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:57.386 A:middle
algorithms even further while

00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:58.616 A:middle
protecting user privacy.

00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.936 A:middle
Also, for Safari, since last
