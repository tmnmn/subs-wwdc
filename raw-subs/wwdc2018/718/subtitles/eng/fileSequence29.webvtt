00:28:59.936 --> 00:29:01.426 A:middle
impact on a user's privacy.

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:04.226 A:middle
And as Joey mentioned earlier,

00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:06.806 A:middle
you should avoid unnecessary

00:29:06.806 --> 00:29:08.226 A:middle
requests for resources.

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:12.036 A:middle
So, for example, if a library

00:29:12.036 --> 00:29:14.076 A:middle
that you want to use requires an

00:29:14.076 --> 00:29:15.926 A:middle
entitlement or access to some

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:17.876 A:middle
other sensitive resource that

00:29:17.876 --> 00:29:19.646 A:middle
isn't required from the

00:29:19.646 --> 00:29:20.776 A:middle
functionality you're trying to

00:29:20.776 --> 00:29:22.896 A:middle
get out of this library, you

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:23.956 A:middle
should either find a different

00:29:23.956 --> 00:29:26.016 A:middle
library or reach out to the

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.606 A:middle
developer of that library and

00:29:27.606 --> 00:29:29.056 A:middle
ask them to remove that

00:29:29.056 --> 00:29:30.246 A:middle
sensitive resource request.

00:29:30.926 --> 00:29:34.076 A:middle
Now thinking about third-parties

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.946 A:middle
extends to your server side as

00:29:35.946 --> 00:29:36.246 A:middle
well.

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.356 A:middle
You should understand how data

00:29:39.356 --> 00:29:41.756 A:middle
flows to all third parties your

00:29:41.756 --> 00:29:42.476 A:middle
server's touch.

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:45.796 A:middle
Now this includes the full

00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:47.516 A:middle
breadth of systems that support

00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.976 A:middle
your app, not just analytics or

00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:51.976 A:middle
advertising networks but the

00:29:51.976 --> 00:29:54.016 A:middle
network security systems, the

00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:55.726 A:middle
email provider that sends

00:29:55.796 --> 00:29:58.096 A:middle
customers password reset emails

00:29:58.686 --> 00:30:00.766 A:middle
or third-party customer support
