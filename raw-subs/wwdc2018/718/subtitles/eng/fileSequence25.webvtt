00:24:58.316 --> 00:25:00.426 A:middle
interaction timer will read 5

00:25:00.426 --> 00:25:04.026 A:middle
days despite there being 45 days

00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
since the user was last on

00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:07.976 A:middle
video.example in a first-party

00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:08.686 A:middle
context.

00:25:10.096 --> 00:25:11.926 A:middle
Adopting the Storage Access API

00:25:11.926 --> 00:25:13.876 A:middle
will allow your users to stay

00:25:13.876 --> 00:25:16.446 A:middle
logged in and prevent unwanted

00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:16.816 A:middle
tracking.

00:25:17.306 --> 00:25:21.366 A:middle
Now privacy does not end with

00:25:21.366 --> 00:25:23.006 A:middle
gaining access to a user's data.

00:25:23.986 --> 00:25:25.336 A:middle
Privacy is a continued

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:27.256 A:middle
obligation to your users to

00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:29.246 A:middle
maintain their trust throughout

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:30.146 A:middle
the data's lifetime.

00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:32.636 A:middle
This is where data stewardship

00:25:32.766 --> 00:25:33.266 A:middle
begins.

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.646 A:middle
Now I want to give you examples

00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:38.206 A:middle
from four areas of data

00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:39.466 A:middle
stewardship for you to think

00:25:39.466 --> 00:25:42.476 A:middle
about when developing your apps.

00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:43.406 A:middle
First is deletion.

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.706 A:middle
Part of being a good data

00:25:45.706 --> 00:25:47.176 A:middle
steward is respecting your

00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:49.106 A:middle
user's intent to delete

00:25:49.106 --> 00:25:51.166 A:middle
something from your app.

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:54.476 A:middle
So you should recognize that

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:55.756 A:middle
there are data flows that go

00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:58.066 A:middle
outside your app, and you should

00:25:58.066 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
ensure consistency between these
