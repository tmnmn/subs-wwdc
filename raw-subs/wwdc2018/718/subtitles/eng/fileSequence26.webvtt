00:25:58.066 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
ensure consistency between these

00:26:00.236 --> 00:26:02.136 A:middle
systems when the user deletes

00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:03.686 A:middle
something in your app.

00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:06.686 A:middle
Now the operating system doesn't

00:26:06.686 --> 00:26:08.066 A:middle
know what's happening inside

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.776 A:middle
your app, so if you've donated

00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:11.586 A:middle
information to Siri Shortcuts or

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.666 A:middle
posted a notification, you

00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:14.966 A:middle
should make sure that you delete

00:26:14.996 --> 00:26:16.786 A:middle
that content when the user

00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:18.486 A:middle
removes it from your app.

00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:22.936 A:middle
For example, if a user deletes

00:26:22.936 --> 00:26:25.186 A:middle
someone in your app's contact

00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:27.166 A:middle
list, Siri Suggestions should

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:28.686 A:middle
not suggest them to message

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:30.646 A:middle
using your app.

00:26:30.786 --> 00:26:32.826 A:middle
Or if a user deletes a thread in

00:26:32.826 --> 00:26:34.756 A:middle
your messaging application, you

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:36.166 A:middle
should delete the notifications

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:37.836 A:middle
for that content as well as it

00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:39.476 A:middle
would be unexpected for a user

00:26:39.476 --> 00:26:40.906 A:middle
to see notifications still on

00:26:40.906 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
their device from a thread they

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:43.436 A:middle
thought they'd completely

00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:43.806 A:middle
deleted.

00:26:44.316 --> 00:26:46.696 A:middle
And finally, if you're a

00:26:46.696 --> 00:26:48.316 A:middle
passwords manager, and you've

00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:50.216 A:middle
donated passwords to the New

00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:52.346 A:middle
System Passwords API, you should

00:26:52.346 --> 00:26:53.326 A:middle
make sure to delete this

00:26:53.326 --> 00:26:55.336 A:middle
information if the user removes

00:26:55.336 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
the site from your password

00:26:58.376 --> 00:26:58.756 A:middle
manager.

00:26:59.116 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
Now data stewardship continues
