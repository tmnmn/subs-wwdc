00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:01.066 A:middle
And a user might have picked a

00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:02.626 A:middle
brown beard and a brown

00:34:02.626 --> 00:34:04.276 A:middle
handlebar moustache and brown

00:34:04.276 --> 00:34:05.966 A:middle
long hair for their avatar.

00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:07.956 A:middle
And we can make predictions from

00:34:07.956 --> 00:34:08.426 A:middle
the model.

00:34:08.626 --> 00:34:10.246 A:middle
By providing those interactions

00:34:10.246 --> 00:34:10.886 A:middle
as input.

00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:13.416 A:middle
And where we say k10 means we'll

00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:14.996 A:middle
get the top ten predictions

00:34:15.346 --> 00:34:16.426 A:middle
given those inputs.

00:34:17.045 --> 00:34:20.686 A:middle
So to recap what we've learned

00:34:20.686 --> 00:34:21.116 A:middle
today.

00:34:22.286 --> 00:34:24.255 A:middle
Turi Create allows you to create

00:34:24.255 --> 00:34:26.196 A:middle
Core ML models to power

00:34:26.196 --> 00:34:27.755 A:middle
intelligent features in your

00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:28.286 A:middle
apps.

00:34:28.606 --> 00:34:30.775 A:middle
It uses a simple five-step

00:34:30.775 --> 00:34:33.235 A:middle
recipe starting with identifying

00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:34.275 A:middle
the task that you're doing.

00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:35.735 A:middle
And mapping it to a machine

00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:36.496 A:middle
learning task.

00:34:37.025 --> 00:34:39.045 A:middle
Gathering and annotating data

00:34:39.226 --> 00:34:41.126 A:middle
for use in training that model.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.946 A:middle
Training the model itself using

00:34:43.946 --> 00:34:45.246 A:middle
a simple, high-level API

00:34:45.755 --> 00:34:47.096 A:middle
specific to the task that you're

00:34:47.096 --> 00:34:47.505 A:middle
doing.

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:50.235 A:middle
Evaluating that model in Turi

00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:51.996 A:middle
Create both qualitatively and

00:34:51.996 --> 00:34:52.826 A:middle
quantitatively.

00:34:53.366 --> 00:34:55.755 A:middle
And finally, deploying in Core

00:34:55.755 --> 00:34:56.406 A:middle
ML format.

00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:01.196 A:middle
That five-step recipe maps to
