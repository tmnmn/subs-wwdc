00:13:56.396 --> 00:14:00.376 A:middle
And that we way we can refer to

00:14:00.376 --> 00:14:01.946 A:middle
it as TC throughout the rest of

00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:02.416 A:middle
the script.

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.326 A:middle
Now, the first task we want to

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.336 A:middle
do is load data.

00:14:07.916 --> 00:14:12.086 A:middle
And we're going to load it up

00:14:12.086 --> 00:14:13.356 A:middle
into SFrame format.

00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:15.846 A:middle
So first we can say images

00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:18.046 A:middle
equals TC.loadimages.

00:14:18.536 --> 00:14:19.386 A:middle
And we're going to give it that

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:21.216 A:middle
folder day that I just showed in

00:14:21.216 --> 00:14:21.616 A:middle
Finder.

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:26.476 A:middle
And Turi Create provides

00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:28.206 A:middle
utilities to interactively

00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:29.766 A:middle
explore and visualize our data.

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:31.346 A:middle
So let's make sure those images

00:14:31.346 --> 00:14:32.866 A:middle
loaded correctly and we got the

00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:34.016 A:middle
resulting SFrame that we

00:14:34.016 --> 00:14:34.496 A:middle
expected.

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:36.696 A:middle
I'm just going to call .explore,

00:14:37.456 --> 00:14:38.826 A:middle
and this is going to open up a

00:14:38.826 --> 00:14:40.346 A:middle
visualization window where we

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:41.976 A:middle
can see that we have two columns

00:14:41.976 --> 00:14:42.696 A:middle
in our SFrame.

00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:44.746 A:middle
The first is called path, and

00:14:44.746 --> 00:14:46.256 A:middle
it's the relative path to that

00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:47.106 A:middle
image on disk.

00:14:47.536 --> 00:14:48.816 A:middle
And the second column is called

00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:49.296 A:middle
image.

00:14:49.566 --> 00:14:50.876 A:middle
And that's actually the contents

00:14:50.876 --> 00:14:51.866 A:middle
of the image itself.

00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:53.166 A:middle
And we can see our breakfast

00:14:53.206 --> 00:14:53.906 A:middle
foods right here.

00:14:54.676 --> 00:14:55.586 A:middle
It looks like these loaded

00:14:55.586 --> 00:14:56.956 A:middle
correctly, so I'm going to

00:14:56.956 --> 00:14:57.356 A:middle
proceed.

00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:01.026 A:middle
Back in Jupyter notebook.
