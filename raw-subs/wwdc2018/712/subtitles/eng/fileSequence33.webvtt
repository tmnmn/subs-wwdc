items for users based on user's

00:33:00.496 --> 00:33:01.686 A:middle
historical preferences.

00:33:02.896 --> 00:33:04.636 A:middle
This type of model is deployed

00:33:04.636 --> 00:33:06.506 A:middle
using Core ML's new custom model

00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:08.586 A:middle
support that's available on

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:11.026 A:middle
macOS Mojave and on iOS 12.

00:33:11.686 --> 00:33:12.966 A:middle
This has been a top community

00:33:12.966 --> 00:33:14.576 A:middle
feature request since we open

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:15.546 A:middle
sourced Turi Create.

00:33:15.806 --> 00:33:16.956 A:middle
So I'm really excited to bring

00:33:16.956 --> 00:33:17.576 A:middle
it to you today.

00:33:24.046 --> 00:33:25.846 A:middle
The recommender model in Core ML

00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:27.376 A:middle
looks just like any other Core

00:33:27.376 --> 00:33:27.956 A:middle
ML model.

00:33:28.266 --> 00:33:29.656 A:middle
But what's worth noting is

00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:30.876 A:middle
there's a section at the bottom

00:33:30.876 --> 00:33:32.496 A:middle
here called Dependencies.

00:33:33.046 --> 00:33:34.416 A:middle
And in this section, you can see

00:33:34.416 --> 00:33:36.156 A:middle
that this model uses a custom

00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:37.986 A:middle
model and that model is called

00:33:37.986 --> 00:33:39.006 A:middle
TC recommender.

00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:40.886 A:middle
And this is just Turi Create

00:33:41.036 --> 00:33:42.056 A:middle
providing support for

00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:44.206 A:middle
recommenders in Core ML through

00:33:44.206 --> 00:33:45.346 A:middle
that custom model API.

00:33:46.016 --> 00:33:49.476 A:middle
Using that model in Core ML look

00:33:49.536 --> 00:33:50.916 A:middle
very similar to any other Core

00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:51.776 A:middle
ML model as well.

00:33:52.316 --> 00:33:53.506 A:middle
You can just instantiate the

00:33:53.506 --> 00:33:55.696 A:middle
model, create your input.

00:33:55.776 --> 00:33:57.696 A:middle
So in this case, we've got that

00:33:57.696 --> 00:33:59.046 A:middle
avatar creation app.

00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:01.066 A:middle
And a user might have picked a
