00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:01.026 A:middle
Back in Jupyter notebook.

00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:02.786 A:middle
Now I'm also going to load up a

00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:04.196 A:middle
second SFrame called

00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:04.996 A:middle
annotations.

00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:09.416 A:middle
And this I'm just going to call

00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:11.066 A:middle
the SFrame instructor and

00:15:11.066 --> 00:15:12.346 A:middle
provide a file name to

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:13.896 A:middle
annotations.csv.

00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:16.286 A:middle
This is a CSV file containing

00:15:16.286 --> 00:15:17.776 A:middle
the annotations that correspond

00:15:17.776 --> 00:15:18.546 A:middle
to those images.

00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:23.256 A:middle
And let's take a look at that.

00:15:23.876 --> 00:15:25.206 A:middle
Right in Jupyter notebook, we

00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.296 A:middle
can see that this SFrame

00:15:26.296 --> 00:15:28.146 A:middle
contains a path column, again

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:29.476 A:middle
pointing to that relative path

00:15:29.476 --> 00:15:30.706 A:middle
on disk of the image.

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:32.926 A:middle
And an annotation column

00:15:33.156 --> 00:15:34.606 A:middle
containing a JSON object

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:36.326 A:middle
describing the bounding box and

00:15:36.326 --> 00:15:37.966 A:middle
labels associated with that

00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:38.366 A:middle
image.

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:40.866 A:middle
But now we have two different

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:42.636 A:middle
data sources and we need to

00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:44.286 A:middle
provide one data source to train

00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:44.776 A:middle
our model.

00:15:45.316 --> 00:15:46.406 A:middle
Let's join them together.

00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:48.986 A:middle
In Turi Create, this is as easy

00:15:48.986 --> 00:15:50.186 A:middle
as calling the join method.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.626 A:middle
I'm going to say data equals

00:15:52.956 --> 00:15:57.946 A:middle
images.joinannotations and now

00:15:58.066 --> 00:15:59.916 A:middle
we can see we have a single
