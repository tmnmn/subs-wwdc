00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.416 A:middle
So I'm going to start out in

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:11.956 A:middle
Finder.

00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:14.216 A:middle
Here I've got a folder of images

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:15.906 A:middle
that I want to use to train a

00:13:15.906 --> 00:13:16.266 A:middle
model.

00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:18.546 A:middle
We can see this folder's named

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:21.476 A:middle
Data, and it's full of images of

00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:22.296 A:middle
breakfast foods.

00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:25.046 A:middle
I've got a croissant, some eggs,

00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:25.936 A:middle
and so on.

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:29.006 A:middle
This is, this is a good data set

00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:29.736 A:middle
for breakfast food.

00:13:29.736 --> 00:13:31.086 A:middle
I think let's go ahead and write

00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:31.746 A:middle
some code with it.

00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:34.806 A:middle
I'm going to switch over to an

00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:35.986 A:middle
environment called Jupyter

00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:36.466 A:middle
notebook.

00:13:37.096 --> 00:13:38.546 A:middle
This is an interactive Python

00:13:38.546 --> 00:13:40.576 A:middle
environment where you can run

00:13:40.576 --> 00:13:42.026 A:middle
snippets of Python code and

00:13:42.026 --> 00:13:43.256 A:middle
immediately see the output.

00:13:43.526 --> 00:13:45.126 A:middle
So this is a great way to

00:13:45.126 --> 00:13:46.526 A:middle
interactively work with a model.

00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:48.616 A:middle
And it's very similar in concept

00:13:48.816 --> 00:13:50.066 A:middle
to Xcode Playgrounds.

00:13:51.056 --> 00:13:52.116 A:middle
The first thing we're going to

00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:55.996 A:middle
do is import Turi Create as TC.

00:13:56.396 --> 00:14:00.376 A:middle
And that we way we can refer to
