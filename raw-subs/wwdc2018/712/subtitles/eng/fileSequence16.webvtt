00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle
SFrame with three columns.

00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:03.766 A:middle
It joined on that path column.

00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:05.956 A:middle
So for each image with a path,

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:07.766 A:middle
it combined the annotations for

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:08.246 A:middle
that path.

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.566 A:middle
And so now for each image, we

00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:11.806 A:middle
have annotations available.

00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.486 A:middle
Now we're ready to train a

00:16:13.486 --> 00:16:13.786 A:middle
model.

00:16:14.386 --> 00:16:17.936 A:middle
So I'm going to create a new

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:20.396 A:middle
section here called train a

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:20.716 A:middle
model.

00:16:23.406 --> 00:16:26.006 A:middle
And that's just one line of code

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:26.276 A:middle
here.

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:28.096 A:middle
I'm going to say model equals

00:16:28.426 --> 00:16:30.606 A:middle
TC.objectdetector.create.

00:16:30.936 --> 00:16:31.896 A:middle
And this is our simple

00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:33.636 A:middle
task-focused API for object

00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:35.166 A:middle
detection that expects data in

00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:35.696 A:middle
this format.

00:16:36.476 --> 00:16:37.906 A:middle
I'm going to pass in that data

00:16:37.906 --> 00:16:39.226 A:middle
SFrame that I just created.

00:16:39.686 --> 00:16:41.126 A:middle
And for the purposes of today's

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.816 A:middle
demo, I'm going to pass another

00:16:42.816 --> 00:16:44.686 A:middle
parameter called max iterations

00:16:45.136 --> 00:16:46.706 A:middle
and normally you wouldn't need

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:48.046 A:middle
to pass this parameter because

00:16:48.086 --> 00:16:49.366 A:middle
Turi Create will pick the

00:16:49.366 --> 00:16:50.846 A:middle
correct number of iterations for

00:16:50.846 --> 00:16:51.076 A:middle
you.

00:16:51.226 --> 00:16:52.206 A:middle
Based on the data that you

00:16:52.206 --> 00:16:52.676 A:middle
provide.

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:54.916 A:middle
In this case, I'm going to say

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.876 A:middle
max iterations equals one just

00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:58.216 A:middle
to give an example of what

00:16:58.216 --> 00:16:59.076 A:middle
training would look like.

00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:01.216 A:middle
And the reason this is going to
