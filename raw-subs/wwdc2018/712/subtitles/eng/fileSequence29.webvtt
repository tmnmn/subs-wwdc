00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:02.306 A:middle
She always looks like that.

00:29:02.306 --> 00:29:04.546 A:middle
And we're going to go ahead and

00:29:04.546 --> 00:29:06.096 A:middle
stylize that image using the

00:29:06.096 --> 00:29:07.036 A:middle
model that we just trained.

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:10.526 A:middle
So I'm going to say stylized

00:29:10.526 --> 00:29:13.236 A:middle
image equals model.stylize.

00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:15.876 A:middle
And in this case, the function

00:29:15.876 --> 00:29:17.486 A:middle
is called stylize because the

00:29:17.486 --> 00:29:19.386 A:middle
model is specific to the task of

00:29:19.386 --> 00:29:20.186 A:middle
style transfer.

00:29:20.416 --> 00:29:22.806 A:middle
And we're going to pass in that

00:29:22.806 --> 00:29:23.606 A:middle
sample image.

00:29:23.956 --> 00:29:25.416 A:middle
And I'm going to say style

00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:27.206 A:middle
equals three because that's the

00:29:27.206 --> 00:29:28.956 A:middle
style that we picked earlier

00:29:28.956 --> 00:29:30.146 A:middle
that looks like firewood here.

00:29:32.116 --> 00:29:33.956 A:middle
So let's see what that stylized

00:29:33.956 --> 00:29:34.656 A:middle
image looks like.

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:38.646 A:middle
I can call .show on that, and

00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:39.976 A:middle
here is my cat looking like a

00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:40.746 A:middle
pile of firewood.

00:29:41.516 --> 00:29:46.426 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:46.926 --> 00:29:48.376 A:middle
Let's make sure this works on

00:29:48.376 --> 00:29:49.256 A:middle
other styles, too.

00:29:49.946 --> 00:29:52.336 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and make a

00:29:52.336 --> 00:29:58.496 A:middle
stylized image out of that

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.256 A:middle
sample image.

00:29:59.576 --> 00:30:02.276 A:middle
And I'm going to specify a style
