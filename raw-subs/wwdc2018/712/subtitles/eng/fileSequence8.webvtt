00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:01.426 A:middle
So it's also worth noting that

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:03.066 A:middle
with object detection, you can

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.196 A:middle
reference or detect multiple

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:07.486 A:middle
images, multiple objects within

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:07.996 A:middle
each image.

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:11.086 A:middle
So I mentioned that we'd be

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:12.816 A:middle
loading our data into this

00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:14.246 A:middle
tabular data structure called an

00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:14.686 A:middle
SFrame.

00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:16.716 A:middle
And in this example, we will end

00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:17.926 A:middle
up with two columns.

00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:19.326 A:middle
The first column will contain

00:08:19.326 --> 00:08:19.836 A:middle
your images.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.086 A:middle
The second column will contain

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:24.000 A:middle
your annotations in JSON format.

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.306 A:middle
Let's or by now you're probably

00:08:29.306 --> 00:08:30.886 A:middle
wondering what is an SFrame?

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:32.506 A:middle
So let's take a step back and,

00:08:32.506 --> 00:08:34.706 A:middle
and learn more about it.

00:08:34.706 --> 00:08:36.596 A:middle
SFrame is a [inaudible] tabular

00:08:36.596 --> 00:08:37.376 A:middle
data structure.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:39.006 A:middle
And what this means is you can

00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:40.976 A:middle
create machine learning models

00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:41.806 A:middle
on your laptop.

00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:43.015 A:middle
Even if you have enormous

00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:45.226 A:middle
amounts of data.

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:46.656 A:middle
SFrame allows you to perform

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.676 A:middle
common data manipulation tasks.

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:50.816 A:middle
Like joining two SFrames or

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:52.686 A:middle
filtering to specific rows or

00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:53.476 A:middle
columns of data.

00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:57.046 A:middle
SFrames let you work with all

00:08:57.046 --> 00:08:57.976 A:middle
different data types.

00:08:58.926 --> 00:08:59.986 A:middle
And once you have your data
