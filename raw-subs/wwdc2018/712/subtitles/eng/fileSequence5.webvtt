00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:00.436 A:middle
we reference them in machine

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:01.176 A:middle
learning terms.

00:05:01.716 --> 00:05:03.196 A:middle
So what we can do now is revisit

00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:04.596 A:middle
those intelligent experiences

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.326 A:middle
that we walked through at the

00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:06.606 A:middle
beginning of this presentation

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:08.176 A:middle
and assign them to these machine

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:09.026 A:middle
learning tasks.

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:10.856 A:middle
For example, if you want to

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:12.616 A:middle
recognize different types of

00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:14.676 A:middle
flowers in photos we call that

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:15.826 A:middle
image classification.

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:19.136 A:middle
If you want to take pictures of

00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:20.766 A:middle
your breakfast and understand

00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:22.096 A:middle
the different food objects

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:24.066 A:middle
within them, we call them, that

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:24.876 A:middle
object detection.

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:27.986 A:middle
If you want to apply artistic

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:30.246 A:middle
styles to your own photos, we

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.546 A:middle
call that style transfer.

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:35.256 A:middle
And if you want to recognize

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:37.046 A:middle
gestures or motions or different

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:38.816 A:middle
activities using sensors of

00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:40.556 A:middle
different devices, we call that

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:41.896 A:middle
activity classification.

00:05:43.996 --> 00:05:45.616 A:middle
Finally, if you want to make

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:46.906 A:middle
personalized recommendations to

00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:48.886 A:middle
your users, we call this task

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:50.086 A:middle
recommender systems.

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:53.936 A:middle
Now the great thing is that the

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.756 A:middle
same five-step recipe we just

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:57.596 A:middle
walked through also applies to

00:05:57.596 --> 00:05:58.106 A:middle
your code.

00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:00.786 A:middle
We begin by importing Turi
