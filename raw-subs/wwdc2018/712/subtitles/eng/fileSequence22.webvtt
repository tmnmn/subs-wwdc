00:22:00.046 --> 00:22:01.686 A:middle
So here in finder, I've got my

00:22:01.686 --> 00:22:03.316 A:middle
breakfastmodel.mlmodel.

00:22:03.316 --> 00:22:05.636 A:middle
And when I open it in Xcode, I

00:22:05.636 --> 00:22:07.106 A:middle
can see that it looks just like

00:22:07.106 --> 00:22:08.306 A:middle
any Core ML model.

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:12.176 A:middle
It takes an input image, and as

00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:14.526 A:middle
output we get confidence and

00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:15.206 A:middle
coordinates.

00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:16.706 A:middle
And that's going to tell us the

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:18.336 A:middle
predicted bounding box and label

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:19.436 A:middle
for the image that we have.

00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:22.206 A:middle
Now let's switch over to the

00:22:22.246 --> 00:22:23.646 A:middle
iPhone app where we're going to

00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:24.616 A:middle
consume this model.

00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:30.306 A:middle
So here on my iPhone, I've got

00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:31.716 A:middle
an app called Food Predictor.

00:22:32.356 --> 00:22:33.336 A:middle
And this is going to use the

00:22:33.336 --> 00:22:34.456 A:middle
model that we just trained.

00:22:35.356 --> 00:22:36.646 A:middle
Here I'm going to choose from

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.096 A:middle
photos.

00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:39.026 A:middle
And I've got a picture of this

00:22:39.026 --> 00:22:40.036 A:middle
morning's breakfast.

00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:41.506 A:middle
This is a pretty typical

00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:42.916 A:middle
breakfast for me: coffee and a

00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:43.326 A:middle
banana.

00:22:43.796 --> 00:22:45.546 A:middle
Well, often I skip the banana.

00:22:46.316 --> 00:22:48.856 A:middle
But suppose I ate a banana this

00:22:48.856 --> 00:22:49.346 A:middle
morning.

00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:53.316 A:middle
We can just tap right on the

00:22:53.316 --> 00:22:53.796 A:middle
image.

00:22:53.796 --> 00:22:54.976 A:middle
And because we know the bounding

00:22:54.976 --> 00:22:57.196 A:middle
box, we can identify the object

00:22:57.196 --> 00:22:58.386 A:middle
within that bounding box.

00:22:58.386 --> 00:22:59.716 A:middle
And here we see the model tells

00:22:59.716 --> 00:23:02.296 A:middle
us this is a banana, and this is
