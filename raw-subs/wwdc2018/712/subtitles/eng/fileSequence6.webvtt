00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:00.786 A:middle
We begin by importing Turi

00:06:00.786 --> 00:06:01.236 A:middle
Create.

00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:04.796 A:middle
We proceed to load our data into

00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:06.046 A:middle
a data structure called an

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:06.466 A:middle
SFrame.

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:07.796 A:middle
And we'll go into a bit more

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:09.156 A:middle
detail on the SFrame data

00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:10.006 A:middle
structure shortly.

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:13.106 A:middle
We'll proceed to create our

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.736 A:middle
model with a simple function,

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:15.446 A:middle
.create.

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:18.116 A:middle
This, this function extracts

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:19.336 A:middle
away the complicated machine

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:22.066 A:middle
learning behind the scenes.

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:24.966 A:middle
We proceed to evaluate our model

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:25.956 A:middle
with the simple function

00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:26.916 A:middle
.evaluate.

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:30.266 A:middle
And finally we can export the

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.586 A:middle
resulting model to Core ML's

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:34.396 A:middle
ML-model format to be easily

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:36.686 A:middle
dragged and dropped into Xcode.

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.226 A:middle
Now I mentioned that this same

00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:41.166 A:middle
five-step template applies to

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.866 A:middle
all the different tasks within

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:43.506 A:middle
Turi Create.

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:45.146 A:middle
So whether you're working on

00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:47.186 A:middle
object detection, image

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:49.716 A:middle
classification or activity

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:51.896 A:middle
classification, the same code

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:52.806 A:middle
template applies.

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:56.826 A:middle
For our first demo today, we're

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:58.016 A:middle
going to walk through a

00:06:58.016 --> 00:06:59.846 A:middle
calorie-counting app that uses

00:06:59.846 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
an object detection model.
