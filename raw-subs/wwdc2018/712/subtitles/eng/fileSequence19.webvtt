00:18:57.096 --> 00:19:00.656 A:middle
And that'll just take a few

00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:01.136 A:middle
seconds.

00:19:01.996 --> 00:19:04.306 A:middle
And then we're going to inspect.

00:19:04.516 --> 00:19:05.556 A:middle
I'm just going to pick a random

00:19:05.556 --> 00:19:06.346 A:middle
prediction here.

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:08.856 A:middle
Let's say index two.

00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.676 A:middle
Here we can see the JSON object

00:19:11.676 --> 00:19:13.346 A:middle
that was predicted in just the

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:14.966 A:middle
same format that the training

00:19:14.966 --> 00:19:16.106 A:middle
data is provided in.

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.316 A:middle
So here we have coordinates,

00:19:18.486 --> 00:19:19.776 A:middle
height, width, x and y.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.196 A:middle
And a label, banana.

00:19:21.796 --> 00:19:23.116 A:middle
And we get a confidence score

00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:23.816 A:middle
from the model.

00:19:23.966 --> 00:19:25.876 A:middle
In this case about .87.

00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:28.466 A:middle
This is a little bit hard for me

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:29.976 A:middle
as a human to interpret though.

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:32.516 A:middle
I can't really tell if this

00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:33.786 A:middle
image is really supposed to be a

00:19:33.786 --> 00:19:35.446 A:middle
banana or whether these

00:19:35.446 --> 00:19:36.866 A:middle
coordinates are where the banana

00:19:36.866 --> 00:19:38.526 A:middle
would appear in that image.

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:41.526 A:middle
Turi Create produces a function

00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:42.996 A:middle
to take the predicted bounding

00:19:42.996 --> 00:19:44.476 A:middle
boxes or the ground-truth

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.036 A:middle
bounding boxes and draw them

00:19:46.066 --> 00:19:47.096 A:middle
right onto the images.

00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:48.836 A:middle
So let's go and do that.

00:19:49.516 --> 00:19:50.976 A:middle
I'm going to create a new column

00:19:51.046 --> 00:19:52.846 A:middle
in my test SFrame called

00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:53.856 A:middle
predicted image.

00:19:54.936 --> 00:19:56.926 A:middle
And I'm going to assign it the

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.906 A:middle
output of the object detector

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
utility called draw bounding
