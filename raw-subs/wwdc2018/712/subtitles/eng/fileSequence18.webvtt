00:18:01.096 --> 00:18:02.866 A:middle
Next, let's test the predictions

00:18:02.866 --> 00:18:04.336 A:middle
of this model and see if it's

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:05.000 A:middle
any good.

00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:11.876 A:middle
So I'm going to make a new

00:18:11.876 --> 00:18:13.096 A:middle
section here called inspect

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:13.676 A:middle
predictions.

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:15.506 A:middle
And we're going to go ahead and

00:18:15.716 --> 00:18:17.436 A:middle
load up a test data set.

00:18:18.026 --> 00:18:19.496 A:middle
And here I've already prepared

00:18:19.496 --> 00:18:20.676 A:middle
one in SFrame format.

00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:21.716 A:middle
So I'm just going to load it,

00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:23.266 A:middle
and I called it

00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:25.046 A:middle
testbreakfastdata.sframe.

00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:26.606 A:middle
There are two important

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.756 A:middle
properties of this test SFrame.

00:18:29.146 --> 00:18:31.126 A:middle
One is that it contains the same

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:33.256 A:middle
types of images that the model

00:18:33.366 --> 00:18:34.316 A:middle
would have trained on.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.216 A:middle
But the second important

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.756 A:middle
property is the model has never

00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:39.266 A:middle
seen these images before.

00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:41.136 A:middle
So this is a good test for

00:18:41.136 --> 00:18:42.126 A:middle
whether that model can

00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:44.176 A:middle
generalize to users' real data.

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:48.466 A:middle
I'm going to make predictions

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:50.176 A:middle
from that whole test set by

00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:52.016 A:middle
calling model.predict and

00:18:52.016 --> 00:18:54.196 A:middle
providing that test SFrame.

00:18:54.396 --> 00:18:55.626 A:middle
And we'll get a batch prediction

00:18:55.626 --> 00:18:56.546 A:middle
for the whole SFrame.

00:18:57.096 --> 00:19:00.656 A:middle
And that'll just take a few
