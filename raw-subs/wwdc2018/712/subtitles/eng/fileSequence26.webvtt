00:25:58.146 --> 00:26:00.106 A:middle
This time, we're going to build

00:26:00.106 --> 00:26:02.000 A:middle
a style-transfer model.

00:26:14.476 --> 00:26:15.926 A:middle
So switching back over to that

00:26:15.926 --> 00:26:17.196 A:middle
Jupyter notebook environment.

00:26:17.546 --> 00:26:19.386 A:middle
I'm going to start once again by

00:26:19.386 --> 00:26:23.476 A:middle
importing Turi Create.

00:26:23.936 --> 00:26:25.000 A:middle
As TC.

00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:30.556 A:middle
Then, I'm going to load up two

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:32.836 A:middle
SFrames, each containing images.

00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:35.236 A:middle
One, is the style images I'm

00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:36.766 A:middle
going to call tc.loadimages, and

00:26:36.766 --> 00:26:37.766 A:middle
I'm going to give it a directory

00:26:37.766 --> 00:26:38.416 A:middle
name, styles.

00:26:39.106 --> 00:26:40.876 A:middle
And then the other is content

00:26:40.876 --> 00:26:41.466 A:middle
images.

00:26:42.956 --> 00:26:44.226 A:middle
And the way that this works is

00:26:44.266 --> 00:26:46.106 A:middle
the style images are the styles

00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.236 A:middle
that you want to turn into

00:26:47.236 --> 00:26:48.376 A:middle
filters you can apply.

00:26:48.376 --> 00:26:50.586 A:middle
And the content images can be

00:26:50.686 --> 00:26:51.596 A:middle
any images that are

00:26:51.596 --> 00:26:53.286 A:middle
representative of the types of

00:26:53.286 --> 00:26:54.346 A:middle
photograph that you would want

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:55.836 A:middle
to apply those filters to.

00:26:56.266 --> 00:26:57.596 A:middle
So in this case, it's just a

00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:58.896 A:middle
variety of photographs.

00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:01.776 A:middle
We're going to load a folder
