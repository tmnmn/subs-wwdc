00:29:59.576 --> 00:30:02.276 A:middle
And I'm going to specify a style

00:30:02.276 --> 00:30:02.966 A:middle
equals seven.

00:30:03.556 --> 00:30:05.986 A:middle
And then let's see what that

00:30:05.986 --> 00:30:07.000 A:middle
looks like.

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:13.896 A:middle
That looks pretty good.

00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:15.236 A:middle
I wonder what the style was that

00:30:15.236 --> 00:30:16.236 A:middle
we just applied to that.

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:18.496 A:middle
Let's take a look at style

00:30:20.826 --> 00:30:21.000 A:middle
images.

00:30:25.306 --> 00:30:26.516 A:middle
Style image seven.

00:30:27.046 --> 00:30:30.066 A:middle
And once again we can just call

00:30:30.066 --> 00:30:31.436 A:middle
.show to see what that style

00:30:31.436 --> 00:30:33.496 A:middle
image looks like and yeah, that

00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:34.736 A:middle
looks like the filter that we

00:30:34.736 --> 00:30:35.746 A:middle
just applied to my cat.

00:30:36.426 --> 00:30:38.696 A:middle
Now that we've got a good style

00:30:38.696 --> 00:30:40.886 A:middle
transfer model, we can just call

00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:43.716 A:middle
model.exportcoreml exactly the

00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:45.206 A:middle
same as any other model, and

00:30:45.206 --> 00:30:47.000 A:middle
save it into Core ML format.

00:30:52.296 --> 00:30:54.126 A:middle
Now, let's switch over to the

00:30:54.126 --> 00:30:55.436 A:middle
iPhone where we have a style

00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:57.306 A:middle
transfer app ready to apply the

00:30:57.306 --> 00:30:58.306 A:middle
filters in this model.

00:30:58.886 --> 00:31:03.446 A:middle
So here I've got my iPhone once
