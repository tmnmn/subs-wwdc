00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.486 A:middle
And what we do behind the scenes

00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:03.026 A:middle
is we ensure that the model we

00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:04.546 A:middle
create for you is customized to

00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:06.076 A:middle
the task and that it's state of

00:10:06.076 --> 00:10:06.496 A:middle
the art.

00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:07.916 A:middle
Meaning it's as high quality and

00:10:07.956 --> 00:10:10.016 A:middle
high accuracy as we can get.

00:10:10.016 --> 00:10:11.206 A:middle
And we're able to do this

00:10:11.206 --> 00:10:12.256 A:middle
whether you have large amounts

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:13.956 A:middle
of data or small amounts of

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:14.206 A:middle
data.

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:16.336 A:middle
It's very important for us that

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:17.926 A:middle
all of our tasks work whether

00:10:17.926 --> 00:10:19.846 A:middle
you have even a small amount of

00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:22.116 A:middle
data as small as about 40 images

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:23.266 A:middle
per item that you're trying to

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:24.676 A:middle
detect in the class of object.

00:10:25.106 --> 00:10:26.276 A:middle
In the case of object detection.

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:30.866 A:middle
Let's move on to evaluation.

00:10:31.236 --> 00:10:32.446 A:middle
So I mentioned we have a simple

00:10:32.446 --> 00:10:34.936 A:middle
function .evaluate that will

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:36.566 A:middle
give you an idea of the quality

00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:37.106 A:middle
of your model.

00:10:38.216 --> 00:10:40.006 A:middle
In the case of object detectors.

00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:42.086 A:middle
We have two factors to consider.

00:10:42.406 --> 00:10:43.846 A:middle
First, we want to know did we

00:10:43.846 --> 00:10:44.766 A:middle
get the label right?

00:10:45.386 --> 00:10:46.966 A:middle
But we also have to know if we

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:48.306 A:middle
got that bounding box right

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:49.476 A:middle
around the object.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.876 A:middle
So we can establish a simple

00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:53.846 A:middle
metric with these two factors

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:55.906 A:middle
and go through a test data set

00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:57.696 A:middle
scoring predictions against

00:10:57.696 --> 00:10:59.996 A:middle
known what we call ground-truth
