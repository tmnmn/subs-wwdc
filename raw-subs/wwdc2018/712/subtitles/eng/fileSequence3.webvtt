00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:00.276 A:middle
Today we're excited to announce

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:01.886 A:middle
that the beta release of Turi

00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:04.216 A:middle
Create 5.0 is now available.

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.026 A:middle
This has some powerful new

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:06.576 A:middle
features.

00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:08.336 A:middle
Like GPU acceleration.

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:09.846 A:middle
And we'll go into these features

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:11.396 A:middle
in detail later on today.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.756 A:middle
The main focus today is going to

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:17.086 A:middle
be the five-step recipe for

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:18.366 A:middle
creating Core ML models.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:20.306 A:middle
I'm going to start by going over

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:21.676 A:middle
these steps at a high level.

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:23.196 A:middle
And then we'll dive into some

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:24.486 A:middle
demos and code.

00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:28.746 A:middle
So the first step you need is to

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:30.166 A:middle
understand the task you're

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.126 A:middle
trying to accomplish.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.276 A:middle
And how we refer to that task in

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:34.316 A:middle
machine learning terms.

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:37.536 A:middle
Second, you need to understand

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:39.656 A:middle
the type of data you need for

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:40.616 A:middle
this task.

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.526 A:middle
And how much of it.

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:45.876 A:middle
Third, you need to create your

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:46.156 A:middle
model.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:50.096 A:middle
Fourth, you need to evaluate

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:50.626 A:middle
that model.

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.066 A:middle
That means understanding the

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.536 A:middle
quality of the model and wheth--

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:54.416 A:middle
whether it's ready for

00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:54.926 A:middle
production.

00:03:56.106 --> 00:03:57.946 A:middle
And finally, when your model's

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.566 A:middle
ready to deploy, it's really

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
easy using Core ML.
