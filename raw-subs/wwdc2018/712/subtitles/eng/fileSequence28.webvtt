00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:01.326 A:middle
it as a filter to another image.

00:28:02.676 --> 00:28:04.666 A:middle
Now let's take a look at some

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:05.566 A:middle
content images.

00:28:06.016 --> 00:28:07.616 A:middle
I'm going to load up a test data

00:28:07.616 --> 00:28:07.916 A:middle
set.

00:28:08.126 --> 00:28:10.566 A:middle
And once again this is a data

00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:12.096 A:middle
set that is representative of

00:28:12.156 --> 00:28:13.936 A:middle
the types of images that users

00:28:13.936 --> 00:28:15.136 A:middle
will have at runtime in your

00:28:15.136 --> 00:28:15.326 A:middle
app.

00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:16.906 A:middle
And the important thing is that

00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:18.606 A:middle
the model never saw these at

00:28:18.606 --> 00:28:19.346 A:middle
training time.

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.366 A:middle
So by evaluating with the test

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.836 A:middle
images, we'll know whether the

00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:24.786 A:middle
model can generalize to users'

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:25.096 A:middle
data.

00:28:26.206 --> 00:28:28.636 A:middle
I'm going to load up a test data

00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:30.496 A:middle
set now.

00:28:30.606 --> 00:28:32.746 A:middle
With tc.loadimages function once

00:28:32.746 --> 00:28:33.086 A:middle
again.

00:28:33.656 --> 00:28:34.906 A:middle
And we're going to call that

00:28:34.906 --> 00:28:36.006 A:middle
folder test.

00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:38.406 A:middle
And I'm going to pull out one

00:28:38.406 --> 00:28:39.696 A:middle
image from the test data set

00:28:39.696 --> 00:28:40.736 A:middle
called ample image.

00:28:41.216 --> 00:28:43.666 A:middle
And I'm just going to take the

00:28:43.666 --> 00:28:44.576 A:middle
first image there.

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:48.016 A:middle
And I'm going to call .show.

00:28:48.016 --> 00:28:51.446 A:middle
So that we can we see what that

00:28:51.446 --> 00:28:52.526 A:middle
image looks like without any

00:28:52.526 --> 00:28:53.256 A:middle
filters applied.

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:58.216 A:middle
That's my cat, seven of nine.

00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:02.306 A:middle
She always looks like that.
