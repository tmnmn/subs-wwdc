00:20:58.286 --> 00:21:01.226 A:middle
call model.evaluate and once

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:02.436 A:middle
again, I'm going to pass in just

00:21:02.436 --> 00:21:04.186 A:middle
that whole test data set.

00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:08.096 A:middle
Here the evaluation function is

00:21:08.096 --> 00:21:09.436 A:middle
going to run the metric that

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.526 A:middle
Aaron described, testing whether

00:21:11.526 --> 00:21:12.546 A:middle
the bounding boxes are

00:21:12.546 --> 00:21:14.556 A:middle
overlapping at least 50% and

00:21:14.556 --> 00:21:15.586 A:middle
have a correct label.

00:21:15.586 --> 00:21:17.226 A:middle
And it's going to give us that

00:21:17.226 --> 00:21:18.756 A:middle
result across each of the six

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:19.926 A:middle
classes that we trained on.

00:21:20.516 --> 00:21:22.036 A:middle
So here we can see that our

00:21:22.356 --> 00:21:24.096 A:middle
overlapping bounding boxes with

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:25.636 A:middle
the correct label are happening

00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:27.696 A:middle
about 80% of the time for bagel.

00:21:28.106 --> 00:21:29.946 A:middle
About 67% of the time for

00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:30.416 A:middle
banana.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:31.276 A:middle
And so on.

00:21:32.456 --> 00:21:34.016 A:middle
That's pretty good, so I think

00:21:34.096 --> 00:21:35.616 A:middle
let's, let's see if this model's

00:21:35.616 --> 00:21:36.966 A:middle
actually going to work in a real

00:21:36.966 --> 00:21:37.226 A:middle
app.

00:21:37.866 --> 00:21:39.526 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and call

00:21:39.806 --> 00:21:42.366 A:middle
exportcoreml to create a Core ML

00:21:42.366 --> 00:21:43.806 A:middle
model from the model we just

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:44.076 A:middle
trained.

00:21:44.226 --> 00:21:45.666 A:middle
And I'm going to call it

00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:47.536 A:middle
breakfastmodel.mlmodel.

00:21:47.826 --> 00:21:49.036 A:middle
And then as soon as that's done

00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:50.546 A:middle
training, I'm going to go ahead

00:21:50.546 --> 00:21:51.656 A:middle
and open it in finder.

00:21:52.236 --> 00:21:55.206 A:middle
Or sorry. As soon as that's done

00:21:55.206 --> 00:21:56.000 A:middle
exporting.
