Good afternoon, and welcome to

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:28.726 A:middle
our session on Turi Create.

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:31.676 A:middle
This session builds upon

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:33.236 A:middle
yesterday's session on Create

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:33.586 A:middle

That session covered many of the

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.826 A:middle
foundations of machine learning

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:37.336 A:middle
in Swift.

experiences to your apps.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.516 A:middle
For example, you might want to

be able to take a picture of

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:53.266 A:middle
your breakfast.

00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:54.916 A:middle
And tap on the different food

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.726 A:middle
items to see how many calories
