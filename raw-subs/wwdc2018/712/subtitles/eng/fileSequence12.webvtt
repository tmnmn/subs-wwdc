00:11:57.356 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
And finally, we move to

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:01.196 A:middle
deployment.

00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:03.146 A:middle
We have an export to Core ML

00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:04.556 A:middle
function that saves your model

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:06.386 A:middle
to Core ML's ML model format.

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:08.056 A:middle
So you can then drag and drop

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:09.486 A:middle
that model in to Xcode.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.046 A:middle
This week we've actually some

00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:13.806 A:middle
exciting new features related to

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:15.296 A:middle
object detection specifically.

00:12:15.856 --> 00:12:16.876 A:middle
So I encourage you to attend

00:12:16.876 --> 00:12:18.716 A:middle
tomorrow's Vision with Core ML

00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:20.506 A:middle
session to learn more.

00:12:20.876 --> 00:12:21.886 A:middle
In that session, the speaker

00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:23.076 A:middle
will actually take the object

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.036 A:middle
detection model that we're

00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:26.146 A:middle
building today and go into more

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:27.706 A:middle
detail about deployment options.

00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:30.996 A:middle
And there you have it!

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.486 A:middle
The five-step recipe for Turi

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:33.826 A:middle
Create.

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:38.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:40.036 A:middle
Thank you.

00:12:40.316 --> 00:12:41.256 A:middle
So with that, I'm going to hand

00:12:41.256 --> 00:12:42.896 A:middle
off to my colleague Zach Nation,

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:43.426 A:middle
for a demo.

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:50.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:51.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Aaron.

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:54.126 A:middle
I think let's just jump straight

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:54.616 A:middle
into code.

00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:55.616 A:middle
Who wants to write some code

00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:56.516 A:middle
live today?

00:12:56.946 --> 00:12:58.096 A:middle
We're going to go ahead and

00:12:58.096 --> 00:12:59.496 A:middle
build an object detector model

00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:00.000 A:middle
right now.
