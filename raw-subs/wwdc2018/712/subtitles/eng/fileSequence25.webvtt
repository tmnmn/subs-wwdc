00:24:59.186 --> 00:25:01.496 A:middle
those styles to that dog is

00:25:01.496 --> 00:25:02.236 A:middle
something like that.

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:05.006 A:middle
And with a style transfer model,

00:25:05.196 --> 00:25:06.956 A:middle
we can take the same styles and

00:25:06.956 --> 00:25:08.296 A:middle
apply them to more photos.

00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:10.246 A:middle
Let's say a cat and another dog.

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:12.046 A:middle
And that's the sort of effect we

00:25:12.046 --> 00:25:13.000 A:middle
would get.

00:25:16.046 --> 00:25:17.566 A:middle
Here's an example of an app that

00:25:17.566 --> 00:25:19.646 A:middle
uses style transfer for filters

00:25:19.816 --> 00:25:21.216 A:middle
on photos that a user would

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:21.946 A:middle
take.

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:26.526 A:middle
The code to create the style

00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:28.386 A:middle
transfer model follows the same

00:25:28.516 --> 00:25:30.466 A:middle
five-step recipe as any other

00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:32.046 A:middle
high-level task in Turi Create.

00:25:32.296 --> 00:25:33.956 A:middle
So you can start by importing

00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:36.076 A:middle
Turi Create, loading data into

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.166 A:middle
the SFrame format, creating the

00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.906 A:middle
model with a simple high-level

00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:40.176 A:middle
API.

00:25:41.326 --> 00:25:42.906 A:middle
Then we make predictions, in

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:44.166 A:middle
this case with a function called

00:25:44.166 --> 00:25:46.186 A:middle
stylize to take an image and

00:25:46.186 --> 00:25:47.536 A:middle
apply that style filter.

00:25:48.166 --> 00:25:49.746 A:middle
Finally, we can export it for

00:25:49.746 --> 00:25:51.576 A:middle
deployment into Core ML format,

00:25:51.576 --> 00:25:52.726 A:middle
just like any other model in

00:25:52.726 --> 00:25:53.000 A:middle
Turi Create.

00:25:56.266 --> 00:25:57.506 A:middle
So let's take a look at another

00:25:57.506 --> 00:25:57.926 A:middle
demo.

00:25:58.146 --> 00:26:00.106 A:middle
This time, we're going to build
