00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:01.216 A:middle
And the reason this is going to

00:17:01.216 --> 00:17:02.556 A:middle
take a minute is it actually

00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:03.856 A:middle
goes through and resizes all of

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.445 A:middle
those images in order to get

00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:06.856 A:middle
them ready to run through the

00:17:06.856 --> 00:17:07.435 A:middle
neural network.

00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:08.836 A:middle
That is under the hood of this

00:17:08.836 --> 00:17:09.665 A:middle
object detector.

00:17:10.465 --> 00:17:12.036 A:middle
And then it will perform just

00:17:12.036 --> 00:17:14.856 A:middle
one iteration on this Mac GPO.

00:17:16.116 --> 00:17:17.965 A:middle
But this is probably not the

00:17:17.965 --> 00:17:19.435 A:middle
best model we could get because

00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:20.496 A:middle
I just wanted to train it in a

00:17:20.496 --> 00:17:21.306 A:middle
couple of seconds.

00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:22.906 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:17:22.906 --> 00:17:24.685 A:middle
switch over to like cooking show

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:25.016 A:middle
mode.

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:26.406 A:middle
And I'm going to take one out of

00:17:26.406 --> 00:17:27.445 A:middle
the oven that we've had in there

00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:28.036 A:middle
for an hour [laughter].

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:30.826 A:middle
[Applause] So I'm going to say

00:17:30.826 --> 00:17:34.676 A:middle
TC.loadmodel and it's called

00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:36.696 A:middle
breakfastmodel.model.

00:17:36.696 --> 00:17:39.546 A:middle
And this is one that I've had an

00:17:39.546 --> 00:17:40.896 A:middle
opportunity to train for a bit

00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:41.316 A:middle
longer.

00:17:41.806 --> 00:17:43.466 A:middle
So let's inspect that right here

00:17:43.466 --> 00:17:44.026 A:middle
in the notebook.

00:17:44.266 --> 00:17:45.396 A:middle
And we can see that it's an

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:46.576 A:middle
object detector model.

00:17:47.226 --> 00:17:48.356 A:middle
It's been trained on six

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:50.336 A:middle
classes, and we trained it for

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:51.486 A:middle
55 minutes.

00:17:52.026 --> 00:17:53.006 A:middle
This is means, this means you

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:54.296 A:middle
can train a useful

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:55.966 A:middle
object-detector model in under

00:17:55.966 --> 00:17:58.000 A:middle
an hour on your Mac.
