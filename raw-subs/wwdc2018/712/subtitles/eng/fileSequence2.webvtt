00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:00.226 A:middle
go over today.

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:02.906 A:middle
And all these demo apps will

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:04.366 A:middle
also be available in our labs.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.056 A:middle
So please join us today or

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.326 A:middle
Friday for the ML labs to get

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:09.376 A:middle
hands-on experience.

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:14.026 A:middle
Turi Create is a Python package

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:15.846 A:middle
that helps you create Core ML

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:16.186 A:middle
models.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.446 A:middle
It's easy to use, so you don't

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:20.816 A:middle
need to be an ML expert or even

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.066 A:middle
have a background in machine

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.326 A:middle
learning to create these

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:24.676 A:middle
exciting user experiences.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:27.366 A:middle
We make it easy to use by

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.646 A:middle
focusing on tasks first and

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:30.206 A:middle
foremost.

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:31.576 A:middle
What we do is we abstract away

00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:32.906 A:middle
the complicated machine-learning

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.776 A:middle
algorithms so you can just focus

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:35.866 A:middle
on the user experience that

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:36.746 A:middle
you're trying to create.

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:39.796 A:middle
Turi Create is cross platform so

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:41.836 A:middle
you can use it both on Mac and

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:42.226 A:middle
Linux.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.436 A:middle
And it's also open source.

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:47.446 A:middle
We have a repo on GitHub and we

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:48.056 A:middle
hope you'll visit.

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:49.406 A:middle
There's a lot of great resources

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:50.186 A:middle
to get started.

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:52.786 A:middle
And we look forward to working

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:54.156 A:middle
with you and the rest of the

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:55.716 A:middle
developer community to make Turi

00:02:55.716 --> 00:02:57.856 A:middle
Create even better over time.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:00.276 A:middle
Today we're excited to announce
