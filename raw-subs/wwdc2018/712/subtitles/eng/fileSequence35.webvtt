00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:01.196 A:middle
That five-step recipe maps to

00:35:01.196 --> 00:35:03.266 A:middle
code starting with import Turi

00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:03.646 A:middle
Create.

00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:05.726 A:middle
You can load data into the

00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:06.526 A:middle
SFrame format.

00:35:07.026 --> 00:35:08.566 A:middle
Create a model using that

00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:10.026 A:middle
task-specific API.

00:35:11.126 --> 00:35:12.726 A:middle
Evaluate the model with an

00:35:12.726 --> 00:35:14.076 A:middle
evaluate function that's once

00:35:14.076 --> 00:35:15.576 A:middle
again specific to the task that

00:35:15.576 --> 00:35:16.086 A:middle
you're doing.

00:35:16.646 --> 00:35:18.096 A:middle
And export for deployment,

00:35:18.356 --> 00:35:19.666 A:middle
calling the export Core ML

00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:20.066 A:middle
function.

00:35:20.536 --> 00:35:23.576 A:middle
Turi Create supports a broad

00:35:23.576 --> 00:35:24.736 A:middle
variety of machine learning

00:35:24.736 --> 00:35:25.296 A:middle
tasks.

00:35:25.736 --> 00:35:27.196 A:middle
Ranging from high-level tasks

00:35:27.196 --> 00:35:29.286 A:middle
like image classification and

00:35:29.286 --> 00:35:31.296 A:middle
text classification, all the way

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:32.896 A:middle
to low-level machine learning

00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:33.436 A:middle
essentials.

00:35:33.436 --> 00:35:34.186 A:middle
Like regression and

00:35:34.186 --> 00:35:35.976 A:middle
classification on any type of

00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:36.246 A:middle
data.

00:35:38.006 --> 00:35:39.806 A:middle
And using the resulting models,

00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:41.266 A:middle
you can power intelligent

00:35:41.266 --> 00:35:42.986 A:middle
features in your apps like

00:35:42.986 --> 00:35:45.036 A:middle
object detection or style

00:35:45.036 --> 00:35:47.196 A:middle
transfer for use as a filter.

00:35:48.216 --> 00:35:50.306 A:middle
For more information, please see

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:52.606 A:middle
the Developer.Apple.com session

00:35:52.806 --> 00:35:53.306 A:middle
URL.

00:35:53.716 --> 00:35:55.316 A:middle
And please come to our labs.

00:35:55.316 --> 00:35:56.736 A:middle
We've got a lab this afternoon

00:35:56.886 --> 00:35:58.056 A:middle
and Friday afternoon.

00:35:58.306 --> 00:35:59.726 A:middle
And we welcome your feedback.
