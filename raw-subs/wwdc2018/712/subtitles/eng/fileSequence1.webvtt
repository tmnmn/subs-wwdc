00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:01.136 A:middle
Or maybe you want to control a

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:03.496 A:middle
lightbulb using your iPhone and

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.486 A:middle
simple gestures.

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:08.736 A:middle
Maybe you want to track an

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:11.096 A:middle
object in real time like a dog

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:12.866 A:middle
or a picture of a dog if you

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.976 A:middle
don't have dogs in the office.

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:17.266 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.116 A:middle
Maybe you have custom avatars in

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:21.566 A:middle
your game, and you want to

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:22.516 A:middle
provide personalized

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.136 A:middle
recommendations like hairstyles

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:26.186 A:middle
based on the beard that the user

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:26.826 A:middle
has selected.

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:29.676 A:middle
Or maybe you want to let your

00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:31.846 A:middle
users apply artistic styles or

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:33.756 A:middle
filters to their own photos.

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:37.056 A:middle
These are very different user

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:37.806 A:middle
experiences.

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:39.756 A:middle
But they have several things in

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:40.136 A:middle
common.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.836 A:middle
First and foremost, they use

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:43.536 A:middle
machine learning.

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:46.556 A:middle
These experiences all require

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:49.906 A:middle
very little data to create.

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:51.516 A:middle
All these models were made with

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:53.646 A:middle
Turi Create and deployed with

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.186 A:middle
Core ML.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.176 A:middle
They all follow the five, the

00:01:57.176 --> 00:01:59.096 A:middle
same five-step recipe that we'll

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:00.226 A:middle
go over today.
