00:46:57.336 --> 00:47:00.956 A:middle
So for the printf function,

00:47:01.396 --> 00:47:02.646 A:middle
there's code represented by a

00:47:02.646 --> 00:47:03.096 A:middle
symbol.

00:47:03.496 --> 00:47:04.756 A:middle
For any of the functions in

00:47:04.756 --> 00:47:06.176 A:middle
PetKit which we're going to see

00:47:06.176 --> 00:47:09.716 A:middle
in a second, the same thing.

00:47:09.936 --> 00:47:11.206 A:middle
And fragments may reference

00:47:11.206 --> 00:47:12.406 A:middle
undefined symbols.

00:47:12.406 --> 00:47:16.476 A:middle
So if your .o file refers to a

00:47:16.476 --> 00:47:18.166 A:middle
function in another .o file,

00:47:18.166 --> 00:47:20.586 A:middle
that .o file's undefined.

00:47:20.626 --> 00:47:22.276 A:middle
And the linker will go and find

00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:23.936 A:middle
those undefined symbols and link

00:47:24.426 --> 00:47:26.146 A:middle
them up.

00:47:26.406 --> 00:47:28.746 A:middle
So I said that object files are

00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:30.236 A:middle
the output of your compiler

00:47:30.236 --> 00:47:30.686 A:middle
actions.

00:47:30.686 --> 00:47:31.726 A:middle
So what are libraries?

00:47:32.576 --> 00:47:34.496 A:middle
Libraries are files that define

00:47:34.496 --> 00:47:36.026 A:middle
symbols that are not part of the

00:47:36.026 --> 00:47:37.426 A:middle
target you are building.

00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:40.896 A:middle
So we have dynamic libraries,

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:44.316 A:middle
and those are Mach-O files that

00:47:44.316 --> 00:47:46.376 A:middle
expose code and data fragments

00:47:46.696 --> 00:47:48.526 A:middle
for executables to use.

00:47:49.546 --> 00:47:52.336 A:middle
Those are distributed as part of

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:52.676 A:middle
the system.

00:47:52.676 --> 00:47:53.636 A:middle
That's what our frameworks are.

00:47:53.636 --> 00:47:54.916 A:middle
And a number of you also use

00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:55.956 A:middle
your own frameworks.

00:47:55.956 --> 00:48:00.256 A:middle
There are also TBD files, or
