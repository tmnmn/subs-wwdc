00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:00.876 A:middle
build action of the scheme one

00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:01.406 A:middle
by one.

00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:03.196 A:middle
Target dependencies still have

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:04.686 A:middle
higher priority in determining

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:05.706 A:middle
which targets build first.

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:07.086 A:middle
But otherwise, Xcode will

00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:07.986 A:middle
respect that ordering.

00:11:08.636 --> 00:11:10.436 A:middle
Now it might be tempting to use

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.256 A:middle
this as it gives you a

00:11:11.256 --> 00:11:12.666 A:middle
predictable build order even if

00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:13.366 A:middle
you haven't set your

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:14.336 A:middle
dependencies correctly.

00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:15.856 A:middle
But you're sacrificing a lot of

00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:17.406 A:middle
parallelization when you do this

00:11:17.796 --> 00:11:18.766 A:middle
and slowing down your build.

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:20.186 A:middle
So we recommend that you leave

00:11:20.186 --> 00:11:21.556 A:middle
the parallelize builds checkbox

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.886 A:middle
enabled, set up your target

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:24.126 A:middle
dependencies correctly and don't

00:11:24.126 --> 00:11:24.946 A:middle
rely on ordering.

00:11:27.296 --> 00:11:29.256 A:middle
Lastly, dependency information

00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:30.956 A:middle
comes from you, the developers.

00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:33.926 A:middle
If you're creating custom shell

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.256 A:middle
script build phases or build

00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:36.636 A:middle
rules, make sure to tell the

00:11:36.636 --> 00:11:38.016 A:middle
build system what its inputs and

00:11:38.016 --> 00:11:38.546 A:middle
outputs are.

00:11:39.086 --> 00:11:40.386 A:middle
This lets the build system avoid

00:11:40.386 --> 00:11:41.626 A:middle
rerunning the script tasks

00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:42.396 A:middle
unnecessarily.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:43.786 A:middle
And can help make sure that they

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.316 A:middle
are executed in the right order.

00:11:45.796 --> 00:11:46.906 A:middle
You can define the inputs and

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.286 A:middle
outputs in the run script phase

00:11:48.286 --> 00:11:48.716 A:middle
editor.

00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:50.236 A:middle
And the paths of these files

00:11:50.236 --> 00:11:51.256 A:middle
will be made available to your

00:11:51.256 --> 00:11:52.816 A:middle
script as environment variables.

00:11:54.456 --> 00:11:56.336 A:middle
Don't rely on auto-link for

00:11:56.336 --> 00:11:57.506 A:middle
target dependencies in your

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:57.976 A:middle
project.

00:11:58.736 --> 00:11:59.676 A:middle
The client compiler has a

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:01.006 A:middle
feature called auto-link which
