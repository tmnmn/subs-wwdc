00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:01.006 A:middle
feature called auto-link which

00:12:01.006 --> 00:12:02.126 A:middle
can be enabled using the link

00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:03.526 A:middle
frameworks automatically build

00:12:03.526 --> 00:12:03.866 A:middle
setting.

00:12:04.586 --> 00:12:05.826 A:middle
This setting allows the compiler

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:06.846 A:middle
to automatically link to the

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
frameworks corresponding to any

00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:09.746 A:middle
modules you import without

00:12:09.746 --> 00:12:11.016 A:middle
having to explicitly link them

00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:12.496 A:middle
in your link library's build

00:12:12.496 --> 00:12:12.816 A:middle
phase.

00:12:13.396 --> 00:12:14.616 A:middle
However, it's important to note

00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:15.666 A:middle
that auto-link does not

00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:17.236 A:middle
establish dependency on that

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.346 A:middle
framework at the build system

00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:18.616 A:middle
level.

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:20.186 A:middle
So it won't guarantee that the

00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:21.746 A:middle
target you depend on is actually

00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:23.306 A:middle
built before you try to link

00:12:23.306 --> 00:12:24.386 A:middle
against it.

00:12:25.016 --> 00:12:26.716 A:middle
So you should rely on this

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:28.286 A:middle
feature only for frameworks from

00:12:28.286 --> 00:12:29.436 A:middle
the platform STK.

00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:31.326 A:middle
Like Foundation and UIKit since

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.706 A:middle
we know those will already exist

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:34.136 A:middle
before the build even starts.

00:12:34.636 --> 00:12:35.546 A:middle
For targets in your own

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:36.976 A:middle
projects, make sure to add

00:12:36.976 --> 00:12:38.416 A:middle
explicit library dependencies.

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:41.566 A:middle
You might also need to create

00:12:41.566 --> 00:12:42.926 A:middle
project references by dragging

00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:44.066 A:middle
and dropping another Xcode

00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:45.506 A:middle
project into your project's file

00:12:45.506 --> 00:12:47.546 A:middle
navigator in order to reveal the

00:12:47.546 --> 00:12:48.926 A:middle
targets of other projects you

00:12:48.926 --> 00:12:49.406 A:middle
depend on.

00:12:49.996 --> 00:12:53.376 A:middle
In conclusion, with accurate

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:54.676 A:middle
dependency information, the

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:55.646 A:middle
build system can better

00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:56.936 A:middle
parallelize your builds, and

00:12:57.046 --> 00:12:58.136 A:middle
help ensure that you get

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:00.106 A:middle
consistent results every time so
