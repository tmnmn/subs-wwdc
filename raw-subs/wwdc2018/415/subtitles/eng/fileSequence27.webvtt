00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:00.946 A:middle
do that.

00:27:01.116 --> 00:27:02.086 A:middle
So how do we build the

00:27:02.086 --> 00:27:02.966 A:middle
foundation module?

00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:05.916 A:middle
First of all, we create a

00:27:05.986 --> 00:27:07.126 A:middle
separate Clang location for

00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:07.306 A:middle
that.

00:27:08.186 --> 00:27:10.466 A:middle
And that Clang location contains

00:27:10.646 --> 00:27:12.076 A:middle
all the header files from the

00:27:12.076 --> 00:27:12.826 A:middle
foundation module.

00:27:13.476 --> 00:27:17.216 A:middle
We don't transfer any of the

00:27:17.216 --> 00:27:19.626 A:middle
existing context from the

00:27:19.626 --> 00:27:21.136 A:middle
original compiler invocation.

00:27:21.586 --> 00:27:23.256 A:middle
Hence, it's context-free.

00:27:24.126 --> 00:27:25.896 A:middle
The thing we actually transfer

00:27:25.896 --> 00:27:27.346 A:middle
are the command line arguments

00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:28.176 A:middle
you passed to Clang.

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:31.966 A:middle
Those are passed on.

00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:33.586 A:middle
While we build the foundation

00:27:33.586 --> 00:27:36.496 A:middle
module, we mod-- the module

00:27:36.496 --> 00:27:37.816 A:middle
itself or the framework, the

00:27:37.816 --> 00:27:40.176 A:middle
framework itself will include

00:27:40.316 --> 00:27:41.776 A:middle
additional frameworks.

00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:43.866 A:middle
That means we have to build

00:27:43.866 --> 00:27:44.836 A:middle
those modules too.

00:27:45.616 --> 00:27:48.226 A:middle
And we have to keep going

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:50.156 A:middle
because those might also include

00:27:50.156 --> 00:27:51.256 A:middle
additional frameworks.

00:27:52.346 --> 00:27:53.536 A:middle
But we already can see there is

00:27:53.536 --> 00:27:54.266 A:middle
a benefit here.

00:27:55.296 --> 00:27:56.676 A:middle
Some of those imports might be

00:27:56.676 --> 00:27:57.266 A:middle
the same.

00:27:57.706 --> 00:27:59.586 A:middle
So we can always start reusing

00:27:59.586 --> 00:28:00.256 A:middle
that module.
