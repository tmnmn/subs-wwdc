00:28:57.716 --> 00:29:00.026 A:middle
you should try to keep the

00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:02.086 A:middle
arguments the same, if possible.

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:07.746 A:middle
So this is how we find and build

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.456 A:middle
modules for system frameworks

00:29:10.426 --> 00:29:12.436 A:middle
but what about your frameworks?

00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:14.316 A:middle
How do we build modules for

00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:14.706 A:middle
those?

00:29:15.246 --> 00:29:18.106 A:middle
Let's go back to our original

00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:20.156 A:middle
cat example, and this time we

00:29:20.156 --> 00:29:20.986 A:middle
turn on modules.

00:29:21.676 --> 00:29:24.826 A:middle
If we would use a headermap

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:27.256 A:middle
again, the headermap will point

00:29:27.256 --> 00:29:29.906 A:middle
us back to the source directory.

00:29:30.506 --> 00:29:32.876 A:middle
But if you look at that source

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:34.016 A:middle
directory, we have a problem

00:29:34.016 --> 00:29:34.336 A:middle
now.

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.956 A:middle
Theirs is no modules directory.

00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:39.496 A:middle
It doesn't look like a framework

00:29:39.496 --> 00:29:42.946 A:middle
at all and Clang doesn't know

00:29:42.946 --> 00:29:44.606 A:middle
how to do this in this case.

00:29:45.526 --> 00:29:47.476 A:middle
So we introduced a new concept

00:29:47.606 --> 00:29:49.846 A:middle
to solve this, and it's called

00:29:50.126 --> 00:29:51.676 A:middle
Clang's Virtual File System.

00:29:52.606 --> 00:29:54.556 A:middle
It basically creates a virtual

00:29:54.556 --> 00:29:57.016 A:middle
abstraction of a framework that

00:29:57.016 --> 00:29:58.656 A:middle
allows Clang to build the

00:29:58.656 --> 00:29:59.216 A:middle
module.
