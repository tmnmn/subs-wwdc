00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:02.606 A:middle
tasks on the graph.

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:03.916 A:middle
Depending on the changes you've

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.496 A:middle
made to your project since the

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.276 A:middle
previous build.

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.806 A:middle
We refer to this as an

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:10.306 A:middle
incremental build and having

00:07:10.336 --> 00:07:11.826 A:middle
accurate dependency information

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.306 A:middle
is very important in order for

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:14.636 A:middle
incremental builds to work

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:15.976 A:middle
correctly and efficiently.

00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:19.306 A:middle
Now we talked about how changes

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:20.476 A:middle
affect the build system, and how

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:21.356 A:middle
they relate to incremental

00:07:21.356 --> 00:07:21.736 A:middle
builds.

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:23.396 A:middle
So how does the build system

00:07:23.396 --> 00:07:24.576 A:middle
actually detect changes?

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:27.466 A:middle
Each task in the build process

00:07:27.466 --> 00:07:29.366 A:middle
has an associate signature which

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:30.506 A:middle
is the sort of hash that's

00:07:30.506 --> 00:07:31.406 A:middle
computed from various

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:32.756 A:middle
information related to that

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:33.686 A:middle
task.

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:36.086 A:middle
This information includes the

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:37.796 A:middle
stat infor of the task's inputs

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:39.416 A:middle
like file paths and modification

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:40.136 A:middle
time stamps.

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:42.066 A:middle
The command line indication used

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:43.556 A:middle
to actually perform the command.

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:45.516 A:middle
And other task-specific metadata

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:46.466 A:middle
such as the version of the

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.776 A:middle
compiler that's being used.

00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:50.716 A:middle
The build system keeps track of

00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:52.486 A:middle
the signatures of tasks in both

00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
the current and the previous

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:53.876 A:middle
build.

00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:55.266 A:middle
So that it knows whether to

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.976 A:middle
rerun a task each time a build

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:57.696 A:middle
is performed.

00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
If the signature of any given
