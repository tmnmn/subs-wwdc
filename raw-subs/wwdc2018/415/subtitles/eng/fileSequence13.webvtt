consistent results every time so

00:13:00.106 --> 00:13:01.176 A:middle
that you can spend less time

00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:02.326 A:middle
building and more time

00:13:02.526 --> 00:13:03.156 A:middle
developing.

00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:05.386 A:middle
For more information on how to

00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:06.436 A:middle
speed up your builds and make

00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:07.516 A:middle
the most of all those cores in

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:09.186 A:middle
your shiny new iMac Pro, we'd

00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:10.196 A:middle
recommend that you check out

00:13:10.196 --> 00:13:11.536 A:middle
Building Faster in Xcode

00:13:11.536 --> 00:13:11.966 A:middle
Session.

00:13:12.346 --> 00:13:13.836 A:middle
And with that, I'm going to hand

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:14.966 A:middle
it over to Jurgen, who's going

00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:16.246 A:middle
to take you into the realm of

00:13:16.246 --> 00:13:16.806 A:middle
the compiler.

00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:22.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:23.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jake.

00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:27.206 A:middle
And now we're going to talk

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.666 A:middle
about what happens behind the

00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:31.216 A:middle
scenes when Xcode build system

00:13:31.296 --> 00:13:32.466 A:middle
invokes the Clang compiler.

00:13:33.976 --> 00:13:34.896 A:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:36.956 A:middle
My name is Jurgen, and I'm a

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.446 A:middle
Compiler Engineer on a Clang

00:13:38.446 --> 00:13:39.016 A:middle
Frontend Team.

00:13:40.096 --> 00:13:41.356 A:middle
Today I'm going to talk about

00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:43.256 A:middle
two features you might not know

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:43.496 A:middle
about.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:45.966 A:middle
The first feature is called

00:13:46.136 --> 00:13:48.366 A:middle
header maps and how we use them

00:13:48.406 --> 00:13:50.446 A:middle
to communicate information from

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:52.116 A:middle
the Xcode build system to the

00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:52.756 A:middle
Clang compiler.

00:13:54.146 --> 00:13:55.496 A:middle
The second feature is called

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.856 A:middle
Clang modules and how we use

00:13:57.856 --> 00:14:00.956 A:middle
them to speed up your builds.
