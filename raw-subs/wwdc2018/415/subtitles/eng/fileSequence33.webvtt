00:32:57.646 --> 00:33:01.066 A:middle
Let's return to our example,

00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:01.796 A:middle
PetWall app.

00:33:02.956 --> 00:33:04.266 A:middle
The app has a view in

00:33:04.266 --> 00:33:05.356 A:middle
ViewCcontroller, written in

00:33:05.406 --> 00:33:05.846 A:middle
Swift.

00:33:06.936 --> 00:33:08.476 A:middle
An Objective-C app delegate.

00:33:09.076 --> 00:33:10.506 A:middle
And Swift unit tests.

00:33:11.686 --> 00:33:13.256 A:middle
In order to compile even just

00:33:13.256 --> 00:33:15.036 A:middle
this top PetViewController part

00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:17.316 A:middle
of the file, the compiler has to

00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:18.446 A:middle
perform four different

00:33:18.446 --> 00:33:19.276 A:middle
operations.

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:21.836 A:middle
First, it has to find

00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:22.576 A:middle
declarations.

00:33:23.396 --> 00:33:25.806 A:middle
Both within the Swift target and

00:33:25.836 --> 00:33:27.556 A:middle
also coming from Objective-C.

00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:30.706 A:middle
Further, it has to generate

00:33:30.706 --> 00:33:31.986 A:middle
interfaces describing the

00:33:31.986 --> 00:33:33.106 A:middle
contents of the file.

00:33:33.516 --> 00:33:35.096 A:middle
So that its declarations can be

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:37.326 A:middle
found and used in Objective-C

00:33:37.796 --> 00:33:39.606 A:middle
and in other Swift targets.

00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:41.906 A:middle
In the rest of this section of

00:33:41.906 --> 00:33:43.156 A:middle
the talk, I'm going to walk

00:33:43.156 --> 00:33:44.746 A:middle
through this example to

00:33:44.746 --> 00:33:46.186 A:middle
illustrate each of these four

00:33:46.186 --> 00:33:46.836 A:middle
tasks.

00:33:47.766 --> 00:33:48.786 A:middle
Let's start with finding

00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:50.386 A:middle
declarations within a Swift

00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:50.776 A:middle
target.

00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:56.326 A:middle
When compiling

00:33:56.376 --> 00:33:58.936 A:middle
PetViewController.swift, the

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.616 A:middle
compiler will look up the type
