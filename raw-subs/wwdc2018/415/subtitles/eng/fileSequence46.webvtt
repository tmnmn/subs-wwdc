00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:00.606 A:middle
And this API's available on the

00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:01.196 A:middle
iOS 11.

00:46:01.686 --> 00:46:03.156 A:middle
This, that's what it all boils

00:46:03.156 --> 00:46:04.536 A:middle
down to by the time it gets to

00:46:04.536 --> 00:46:05.106 A:middle
the linker.

00:46:05.376 --> 00:46:06.626 A:middle
So the linker can determine what

00:46:06.626 --> 00:46:07.656 A:middle
symbols are definitely going to

00:46:07.656 --> 00:46:08.856 A:middle
be there versus what symbols it

00:46:08.856 --> 00:46:11.606 A:middle
may have to, it may have to deal

00:46:11.606 --> 00:46:12.856 A:middle
with at runtime.

00:46:14.756 --> 00:46:16.776 A:middle
Languages can also encode data

00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:18.426 A:middle
into the symbol by mangling it,

00:46:18.426 --> 00:46:19.786 A:middle
as Devin mentioned earlier.

00:46:19.786 --> 00:46:25.066 A:middle
And you'll see that in both C++

00:46:25.506 --> 00:46:27.186 A:middle
and Swift.

00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:29.346 A:middle
So we have symbols which are

00:46:29.346 --> 00:46:32.506 A:middle
these names referring to code

00:46:32.506 --> 00:46:33.136 A:middle
and data.

00:46:33.476 --> 00:46:35.866 A:middle
So the compilers generate object

00:46:35.866 --> 00:46:36.076 A:middle
files.

00:46:36.076 --> 00:46:37.256 A:middle
And those object files are just

00:46:37.286 --> 00:46:40.996 A:middle
collections of those code and

00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:41.296 A:middle
data.

00:46:41.296 --> 00:46:43.956 A:middle
They are not executable.

00:46:43.956 --> 00:46:45.496 A:middle
While they are compiled code,

00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:47.436 A:middle
they aren't finished.

00:46:47.816 --> 00:46:49.446 A:middle
There are bits missing which is

00:46:49.446 --> 00:46:50.486 A:middle
what the linker's going to glue

00:46:50.486 --> 00:46:53.946 A:middle
together and fix up.

00:46:54.226 --> 00:46:55.986 A:middle
Each fragment in one of those

00:46:55.986 --> 00:46:56.976 A:middle
files is represented by a

00:46:56.976 --> 00:46:57.336 A:middle
symbol.

00:46:57.336 --> 00:47:00.956 A:middle
So for the printf function,
