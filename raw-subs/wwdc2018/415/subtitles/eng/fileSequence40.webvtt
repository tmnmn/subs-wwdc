00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:00.856 A:middle
header will include both public

00:40:00.856 --> 00:40:02.476 A:middle
and internal declarations.

00:40:03.056 --> 00:40:04.516 A:middle
This allows you to use internal

00:40:04.516 --> 00:40:06.416 A:middle
Swift from the Objective-C parts

00:40:06.456 --> 00:40:07.626 A:middle
of your app.

00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:10.296 A:middle
For frameworks, however, the

00:40:10.296 --> 00:40:11.846 A:middle
generated header provides only

00:40:11.846 --> 00:40:13.126 A:middle
public declarations.

00:40:13.456 --> 00:40:14.736 A:middle
Since it's included in your

00:40:14.736 --> 00:40:16.386 A:middle
build products and it's part of

00:40:16.386 --> 00:40:17.316 A:middle
the framework's public

00:40:17.316 --> 00:40:17.986 A:middle
interface.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:22.286 A:middle
On the right, you can see that

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.426 A:middle
the compiler ties the

00:40:23.426 --> 00:40:25.646 A:middle
Objective-C class to the mangled

00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:27.956 A:middle
name of the Swift class which

00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:29.336 A:middle
includes the name of the module,

00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:30.276 A:middle
PetWall.

00:40:30.896 --> 00:40:33.066 A:middle
Now I'm going to tell you about

00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:35.346 A:middle
modules in a bit, and Louis will

00:40:35.346 --> 00:40:36.426 A:middle
tell you about mangling.

00:40:36.966 --> 00:40:38.316 A:middle
But for now, the thing to know

00:40:38.646 --> 00:40:40.296 A:middle
is that this prevents a conflict

00:40:40.296 --> 00:40:41.786 A:middle
in the runtime when the two

00:40:41.786 --> 00:40:43.736 A:middle
modules define a class with the

00:40:43.736 --> 00:40:44.416 A:middle
same name.

00:40:44.926 --> 00:40:47.646 A:middle
You can tell Swift to use a

00:40:47.646 --> 00:40:49.176 A:middle
different name for the class in

00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:51.066 A:middle
Objective-C by passing an

00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:53.476 A:middle
identifier to the obc attribute.

00:40:54.266 --> 00:40:55.746 A:middle
But if you do this, you're

00:40:55.746 --> 00:40:57.436 A:middle
responsible for making sure the

00:40:57.436 --> 00:40:58.586 A:middle
names don't conflict.

00:40:59.966 --> 00:41:02.776 A:middle
Here I've used the PWL prefix so
