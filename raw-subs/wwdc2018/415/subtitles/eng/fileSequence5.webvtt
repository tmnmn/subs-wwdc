00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
So the first step is for the

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:02.826 A:middle
build system to take the build

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:04.546 A:middle
description, your Xcode project

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:04.906 A:middle
file.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:07.256 A:middle
Parse it, take into account all

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:09.096 A:middle
the files in your project, your

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:10.326 A:middle
targets and the dependency

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:11.216 A:middle
relationships.

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:13.276 A:middle
Your build settings, and turn it

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.326 A:middle
into a tree-like structure

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:15.646 A:middle
called a directed graph.

00:05:16.306 --> 00:05:17.516 A:middle
And this represents all the

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.136 A:middle
dependencies between the input

00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:20.536 A:middle
and output files in your project

00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:22.216 A:middle
and the tasks that will be

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:23.886 A:middle
executed to process them.

00:05:24.316 --> 00:05:27.856 A:middle
Next the low-level execution

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:29.356 A:middle
engine processes this graph,

00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:30.946 A:middle
looks at the dependency

00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:32.756 A:middle
specifications and figures out

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:34.136 A:middle
which tasks to execute.

00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:35.756 A:middle
The sequence or order in which

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:37.676 A:middle
they must be run and which tasks

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:39.416 A:middle
can be run in parallel.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:41.406 A:middle
Then proceeds to execute them.

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:43.746 A:middle
And by the way, our low-level

00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:44.956 A:middle
build execution engine for the

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:45.936 A:middle
new build system is called

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:46.436 A:middle
llbuild.

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.566 A:middle
And it's open source and

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:48.396 A:middle
developed on GitHub.

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:49.606 A:middle
If you're interested in build

00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:50.996 A:middle
systems development, feel free

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:52.086 A:middle
to check it out and see how it

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:52.446 A:middle
works.

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:53.806 A:middle
We'll have a link to this and

00:05:53.806 --> 00:05:54.966 A:middle
other open source components

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:56.316 A:middle
related to the build process at

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:56.986 A:middle
the end of the talk.

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:59.856 A:middle
Okay, let's talk about

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:00.936 A:middle
discovered dependencies.
