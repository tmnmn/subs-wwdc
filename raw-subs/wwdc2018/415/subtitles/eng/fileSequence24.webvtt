00:23:58.386 --> 00:24:00.216 A:middle
One of them, one of the most

00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:02.966 A:middle
important one is context-free.

00:24:03.516 --> 00:24:04.846 A:middle
What do I mean by context-free?

00:24:05.446 --> 00:24:08.306 A:middle
You can see here two code

00:24:08.306 --> 00:24:08.896 A:middle
snippets.

00:24:09.276 --> 00:24:11.626 A:middle
In both cases we import the

00:24:11.706 --> 00:24:12.766 A:middle
PetKit module.

00:24:13.966 --> 00:24:16.686 A:middle
But we have two different macro

00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:17.826 A:middle
definitions beforehand.

00:24:19.456 --> 00:24:20.976 A:middle
If you would use a traditional

00:24:20.976 --> 00:24:22.536 A:middle
model of importing those

00:24:22.536 --> 00:24:23.716 A:middle
headers, that means they're

00:24:24.106 --> 00:24:24.696 A:middle
[inaudible] included.

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:27.496 A:middle
The preprocessor would honor

00:24:27.496 --> 00:24:29.396 A:middle
this definition and apply it to

00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:30.516 A:middle
the header file.

00:24:31.266 --> 00:24:32.546 A:middle
But if you would do that, that

00:24:32.546 --> 00:24:33.826 A:middle
means the modules would be

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:35.786 A:middle
different for each header case,

00:24:35.786 --> 00:24:37.486 A:middle
and we couldn't reuse it.

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:40.136 A:middle
So if you want to use modules,

00:24:40.336 --> 00:24:41.306 A:middle
you cannot do that.

00:24:41.926 --> 00:24:44.016 A:middle
Instead, the module will ignore

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:45.746 A:middle
all those context-related

00:24:45.886 --> 00:24:48.036 A:middle
information that allows us to

00:24:48.036 --> 00:24:49.716 A:middle
be, that allows it to be reused

00:24:50.186 --> 00:24:52.246 A:middle
across all implementation files.

00:24:53.816 --> 00:24:57.106 A:middle
Another requirement is modules

00:24:57.106 --> 00:24:58.226 A:middle
have to be self-contained.

00:24:59.006 --> 00:25:01.126 A:middle
That means they have to specify
