00:54:59.846 --> 00:55:01.306 A:middle
Now why did we do that?

00:55:01.826 --> 00:55:03.326 A:middle
Well we kept looking, and we

00:55:03.326 --> 00:55:04.416 A:middle
found a copy of open.

00:55:04.416 --> 00:55:07.896 A:middle
And that copy of open is in the

00:55:07.896 --> 00:55:09.876 A:middle
lib system TBD file.

00:55:11.256 --> 00:55:13.306 A:middle
And so we said I know this is

00:55:13.306 --> 00:55:14.416 A:middle
part of the system library.

00:55:14.416 --> 00:55:15.456 A:middle
I'm not going to copy this into

00:55:15.456 --> 00:55:16.146 A:middle
my application.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.336 A:middle
But I need to put enough

00:55:18.336 --> 00:55:19.516 A:middle
information in the information

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.836 A:middle
to make it so that it can call

00:55:20.836 --> 00:55:21.166 A:middle
this.

00:55:21.506 --> 00:55:23.556 A:middle
So we create a fake function

00:55:23.556 --> 00:55:25.626 A:middle
that's just a template where we

00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:26.656 A:middle
replaced a function with

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:27.606 A:middle
whatever we're pulling out of

00:55:27.606 --> 00:55:28.726 A:middle
lib system which is open in this

00:55:28.726 --> 00:55:29.046 A:middle
case.

00:55:29.216 --> 00:55:30.426 A:middle
And if you look in that

00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:32.876 A:middle
function, it actually loads from

00:55:32.876 --> 00:55:35.036 A:middle
a pointer, open$ pointer.

00:55:36.186 --> 00:55:37.416 A:middle
And jumps to it.

00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:38.686 A:middle
So we just need a function

00:55:38.716 --> 00:55:39.996 A:middle
pointer, just like any normal C

00:55:39.996 --> 00:55:40.636 A:middle
function pointer.

00:55:41.256 --> 00:55:44.796 A:middle
And we'll create that down in

00:55:44.796 --> 00:55:46.186 A:middle
the data segment which is where

00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:47.636 A:middle
global variables would be if you

00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:48.396 A:middle
had any globals.

00:55:49.406 --> 00:55:50.966 A:middle
But it's just set to zero.

00:55:51.426 --> 00:55:53.226 A:middle
So if we dereference null and

00:55:53.226 --> 00:55:54.436 A:middle
jump to it we're going to crash.

00:55:56.036 --> 00:55:57.536 A:middle
So we then add what's called a

00:55:57.536 --> 00:55:58.606 A:middle
link edit segment.

00:55:58.606 --> 00:56:01.096 A:middle
And the link edit is metadata
