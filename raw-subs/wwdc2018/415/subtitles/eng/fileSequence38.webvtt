00:37:58.636 --> 00:38:00.146 A:middle
For a parameter of type pet

00:38:00.826 --> 00:38:02.046 A:middle
following the verb draw.

00:38:03.096 --> 00:38:06.456 A:middle
And similarly the word point for

00:38:06.456 --> 00:38:08.206 A:middle
a parameter of type CGPoint

00:38:08.776 --> 00:38:10.606 A:middle
following the preposition at.

00:38:11.736 --> 00:38:13.946 A:middle
These words are omitted in Swift

00:38:14.236 --> 00:38:15.886 A:middle
when the method is imported as

00:38:15.886 --> 00:38:18.326 A:middle
simply draw at.

00:38:19.156 --> 00:38:20.266 A:middle
So how does this work?

00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:22.806 A:middle
Well, you might be surprised to

00:38:22.806 --> 00:38:24.996 A:middle
know that the compiler contains

00:38:24.996 --> 00:38:26.946 A:middle
a list of common English verbs

00:38:26.946 --> 00:38:27.836 A:middle
and prepositions.

00:38:29.416 --> 00:38:31.346 A:middle
Because it is just a hard-coded

00:38:31.346 --> 00:38:32.656 A:middle
list and human language is

00:38:32.656 --> 00:38:34.416 A:middle
messy, sometimes it's missing

00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:34.936 A:middle
words.

00:38:35.796 --> 00:38:37.376 A:middle
Furthermore, in order to match

00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:39.126 A:middle
Swift's naming conventions, the

00:38:39.126 --> 00:38:40.826 A:middle
importer will also rename

00:38:40.826 --> 00:38:43.116 A:middle
methods to remove words based on

00:38:43.116 --> 00:38:43.996 A:middle
the part of speech.

00:38:45.206 --> 00:38:47.316 A:middle
For example the verb feed is not

00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:49.376 A:middle
in the list, and so feedPet is

00:38:49.376 --> 00:38:51.646 A:middle
not imported as feed as we might

00:38:51.646 --> 00:38:52.096 A:middle
expect.

00:38:53.546 --> 00:38:55.246 A:middle
When this happens, you can use

00:38:55.246 --> 00:38:57.686 A:middle
the NS Swift Name annotation to

00:38:57.686 --> 00:38:59.416 A:middle
have the compiler import the

00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:01.966 A:middle
method exactly as you want.
