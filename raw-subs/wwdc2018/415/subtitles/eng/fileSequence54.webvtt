00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:01.556 A:middle
It, it's just replaced with a no

00:54:01.556 --> 00:54:02.046 A:middle
operation.

00:54:02.666 --> 00:54:03.636 A:middle
Finally we branch.

00:54:04.916 --> 00:54:10.276 A:middle
Okay, but we branch and what are

00:54:10.276 --> 00:54:11.366 A:middle
we going to do?

00:54:11.366 --> 00:54:12.456 A:middle
Because we have this undefined

00:54:12.456 --> 00:54:12.816 A:middle
symbol?

00:54:12.876 --> 00:54:14.146 A:middle
Well, we're going to go and keep

00:54:14.146 --> 00:54:15.696 A:middle
looking through, and all of our

00:54:15.696 --> 00:54:16.616 A:middle
.o's have been included at this

00:54:16.666 --> 00:54:17.326 A:middle
point.

00:54:18.416 --> 00:54:19.186 A:middle
So we'll start looking at the

00:54:19.186 --> 00:54:20.496 A:middle
static archives [inaudible] and

00:54:20.596 --> 00:54:22.376 A:middle
PetSupport.a is there.

00:54:22.376 --> 00:54:24.436 A:middle
And inside of PetSupport.a, we

00:54:24.436 --> 00:54:27.286 A:middle
have a couple of files including

00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:30.666 A:middle
PetSounds.o. And if we look, we

00:54:30.666 --> 00:54:31.966 A:middle
see that matching file-- that

00:54:31.966 --> 00:54:33.376 A:middle
matching symbol for playSound.

00:54:34.806 --> 00:54:38.216 A:middle
So we pull it in.

00:54:38.446 --> 00:54:39.796 A:middle
We'll note that we do not pull

00:54:39.796 --> 00:54:42.496 A:middle
in PetCare.o. Because that .o

00:54:42.496 --> 00:54:44.026 A:middle
file did not have any symbols

00:54:44.026 --> 00:54:45.236 A:middle
that were referred to by any of

00:54:45.236 --> 00:54:46.326 A:middle
the other portions of the

00:54:46.326 --> 00:54:46.966 A:middle
application.

00:54:47.536 --> 00:54:49.786 A:middle
Okay, so we pulled that in, but

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.536 A:middle
now that needs, open which we

00:54:52.536 --> 00:54:53.316 A:middle
didn't define.

00:54:53.316 --> 00:54:56.256 A:middle
You'll see in the, in the, the

00:54:56.256 --> 00:54:57.096 A:middle
conversion we copied in.

00:54:57.096 --> 00:54:57.916 A:middle
We actually replaced it with

00:54:57.916 --> 00:54:59.626 A:middle
something called open$stub.

00:54:59.846 --> 00:55:01.306 A:middle
Now why did we do that?
