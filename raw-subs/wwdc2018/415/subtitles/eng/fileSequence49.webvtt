00:48:59.226 --> 00:49:00.156 A:middle
tool which is a wrapper for

00:49:00.156 --> 00:49:00.396 A:middle
that.

00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:02.206 A:middle
And according to the AR

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:04.556 A:middle
[inaudible] page, the AR utility

00:49:04.556 --> 00:49:06.366 A:middle
creates and maintains groups of

00:49:06.366 --> 00:49:08.246 A:middle
files combined into an archive.

00:49:09.396 --> 00:49:10.956 A:middle
Now that may sound a lot like a

00:49:10.956 --> 00:49:13.096 A:middle
TAR file or a ZIP file, and

00:49:13.096 --> 00:49:14.156 A:middle
that's exactly what it is.

00:49:14.156 --> 00:49:16.256 A:middle
In fact, the .a format was the

00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:17.666 A:middle
original archive format used by

00:49:17.776 --> 00:49:19.496 A:middle
UNIX before more powerful tools

00:49:19.496 --> 00:49:20.156 A:middle
came around.

00:49:20.926 --> 00:49:23.726 A:middle
But the compilers of the time

00:49:23.726 --> 00:49:24.476 A:middle
and the linkers of the time

00:49:24.476 --> 00:49:25.536 A:middle
natively understood them, and

00:49:25.536 --> 00:49:26.536 A:middle
they've just kept using them.

00:49:27.006 --> 00:49:28.456 A:middle
So it really is just an archive

00:49:28.456 --> 00:49:28.806 A:middle
file.

00:49:32.046 --> 00:49:33.386 A:middle
One thing worth noting is they

00:49:33.386 --> 00:49:35.506 A:middle
also prenate dynamic linking so

00:49:35.506 --> 00:49:36.826 A:middle
back in those days, all of the

00:49:36.826 --> 00:49:38.196 A:middle
code would be consid-- would be

00:49:38.196 --> 00:49:39.236 A:middle
distributed as archives.

00:49:39.846 --> 00:49:41.776 A:middle
Because of that, you might not

00:49:41.776 --> 00:49:43.896 A:middle
want to include all of the C

00:49:43.896 --> 00:49:45.046 A:middle
library if you're using one

00:49:45.046 --> 00:49:45.676 A:middle
function.

00:49:46.096 --> 00:49:48.976 A:middle
So the behavior is if there's a

00:49:49.096 --> 00:49:50.936 A:middle
symbol in a .o file, we would

00:49:50.936 --> 00:49:52.326 A:middle
pull that whole .o file out of

00:49:52.326 --> 00:49:52.846 A:middle
the archive.

00:49:52.846 --> 00:49:54.616 A:middle
But the other .o files would not

00:49:54.616 --> 00:49:55.246 A:middle
be brought in.

00:49:55.696 --> 00:49:57.696 A:middle
If you're referencing symbols

00:49:57.696 --> 00:49:58.756 A:middle
between them, everything you

00:49:58.756 --> 00:49:59.946 A:middle
need will be brought in.

00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:00.996 A:middle
If you're using some sort of
