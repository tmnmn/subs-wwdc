00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:01.966 A:middle
method exactly as you want.

00:39:06.146 --> 00:39:07.326 A:middle
Now if you want to check to see

00:39:07.326 --> 00:39:08.636 A:middle
how your Objective-C header will

00:39:08.636 --> 00:39:10.586 A:middle
be imported into Swift, you can

00:39:10.586 --> 00:39:12.276 A:middle
always go to Xcode's related

00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:13.066 A:middle
items popup.

00:39:13.546 --> 00:39:14.646 A:middle
This is in the upper left-hand

00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:15.906 A:middle
corner of the source editor.

00:39:16.606 --> 00:39:17.756 A:middle
If you select generated

00:39:17.756 --> 00:39:19.916 A:middle
interfaces, it will show you how

00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:21.506 A:middle
the interface will look in

00:39:21.506 --> 00:39:23.346 A:middle
different versions of Swift.

00:39:25.216 --> 00:39:26.696 A:middle
So that's how Swift imports

00:39:26.696 --> 00:39:27.446 A:middle
Objective-C.

00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.056 A:middle
But what about the other

00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:29.526 A:middle
direction?

00:39:30.246 --> 00:39:32.146 A:middle
How does Objective-C import

00:39:32.146 --> 00:39:33.486 A:middle
Swift?

00:39:35.076 --> 00:39:36.626 A:middle
The answer is that Swift

00:39:36.736 --> 00:39:38.426 A:middle
generates a header that you can

00:39:38.426 --> 00:39:39.096 A:middle
pound import.

00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:41.626 A:middle
This allows you to write classes

00:39:41.626 --> 00:39:43.636 A:middle
in Swift and call them from

00:39:43.636 --> 00:39:44.366 A:middle
Objective-C.

00:39:45.696 --> 00:39:46.726 A:middle
Let's see how this works.

00:39:47.206 --> 00:39:49.746 A:middle
The compiler will generate

00:39:49.746 --> 00:39:51.536 A:middle
Objective-C declarations for

00:39:51.536 --> 00:39:53.766 A:middle
Swift classes extending NSObject

00:39:54.156 --> 00:39:56.566 A:middle
and methods marked at obc.

00:39:57.156 --> 00:39:59.066 A:middle
For apps in unit tests, the

00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:00.856 A:middle
header will include both public
