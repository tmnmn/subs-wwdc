00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:01.196 A:middle
You drop it into a terminal and

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:02.816 A:middle
add the -v option.

00:17:03.796 --> 00:17:05.205 A:middle
Dash-v is symbol for verbose.

00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:07.266 A:middle
And then Clang will tell you

00:17:07.476 --> 00:17:08.576 A:middle
lots of information.

00:17:09.476 --> 00:17:11.036 A:middle
But let's just concentrate on

00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:12.986 A:middle
the one that matter which is the

00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:15.226 A:middle
search paths.

00:17:15.276 --> 00:17:17.846 A:middle
I say search paths and many of

00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:19.836 A:middle
you might expect to see now here

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:22.526 A:middle
search paths that point back to

00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:24.346 A:middle
your source code.

00:17:24.965 --> 00:17:26.646 A:middle
But it's not how this works.

00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:29.546 A:middle
Instead you will see something

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:30.476 A:middle
called headermaps.

00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:34.426 A:middle
Headermaps are used [inaudible]

00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:36.856 A:middle
by the Xcode build system to

00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.656 A:middle
communicate where those header

00:17:38.656 --> 00:17:39.566 A:middle
files are.

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:41.646 A:middle
So let's have a look at those.

00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:42.846 A:middle
Let's have a look the most

00:17:42.846 --> 00:17:44.626 A:middle
important two file-- headermap

00:17:44.626 --> 00:17:46.086 A:middle
files we care about.

00:17:47.656 --> 00:17:50.946 A:middle
The first two entries simply

00:17:51.686 --> 00:17:55.066 A:middle
append the framework name to

00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:55.586 A:middle
your header.

00:17:56.286 --> 00:17:57.126 A:middle
Those two headers in the

00:17:57.126 --> 00:17:58.916 A:middle
beginning are public headers.
