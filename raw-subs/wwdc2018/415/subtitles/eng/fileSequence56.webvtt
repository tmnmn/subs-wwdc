00:55:58.606 --> 00:56:01.096 A:middle
And the link edit is metadata

00:56:01.096 --> 00:56:03.946 A:middle
that the linker tool uses to

00:56:03.946 --> 00:56:05.966 A:middle
leave information for the

00:56:05.966 --> 00:56:06.996 A:middle
operating system and what's

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:08.816 A:middle
called the dynamic linker to fix

00:56:08.816 --> 00:56:09.836 A:middle
this up at runtime.

00:56:09.836 --> 00:56:12.196 A:middle
And for more information on that

00:56:12.196 --> 00:56:13.266 A:middle
you should look at the

00:56:13.266 --> 00:56:14.546 A:middle
Optimizing App Startup Time

00:56:14.546 --> 00:56:19.126 A:middle
session from 2016.

00:56:19.196 --> 00:56:22.346 A:middle
So I just want to go back over

00:56:22.346 --> 00:56:23.456 A:middle
what we went through today.

00:56:23.456 --> 00:56:25.056 A:middle
So Jake talked about the build

00:56:25.056 --> 00:56:26.376 A:middle
system and how you can use

00:56:26.376 --> 00:56:29.076 A:middle
dependencies to optimize your

00:56:29.076 --> 00:56:32.856 A:middle
built process for multi-core.

00:56:33.086 --> 00:56:35.666 A:middle
Jurgen walked through Clang and

00:56:35.666 --> 00:56:36.936 A:middle
how it finds headers for you.

00:56:36.936 --> 00:56:37.986 A:middle
And what you can do to optimize

00:56:37.986 --> 00:56:39.196 A:middle
your build-through modules.

00:56:40.636 --> 00:56:42.926 A:middle
Devin walked through how Swift

00:56:42.926 --> 00:56:45.846 A:middle
expand modules and all of the

00:56:45.846 --> 00:56:47.146 A:middle
things that we've implemented

00:56:47.146 --> 00:56:47.426 A:middle
this year like [inaudible]

00:56:47.426 --> 00:56:48.756 A:middle
processing to speed up your

00:56:48.756 --> 00:56:49.176 A:middle
builds.

00:56:49.176 --> 00:56:51.006 A:middle
And then finally the linker

00:56:51.006 --> 00:56:52.206 A:middle
takes the outputs of both

00:56:52.206 --> 00:56:53.866 A:middle
compilers and builds them into

00:56:53.866 --> 00:56:54.916 A:middle
your application.

00:56:54.916 --> 00:56:56.586 A:middle
At which point Xcode will go

00:56:56.586 --> 00:56:57.646 A:middle
and, and code [inaudible] and

00:56:57.646 --> 00:56:59.416 A:middle
package it up with other parts
