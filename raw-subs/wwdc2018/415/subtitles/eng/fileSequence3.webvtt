00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
with a very specific set of

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
arguments and in a particular

00:03:02.396 --> 00:03:03.746 A:middle
order based on the configuration

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:04.866 A:middle
of your Xcode project.

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.936 A:middle
So what the build system does

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:09.226 A:middle
for you is to automate the

00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:10.506 A:middle
orchestration and execution of

00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:11.946 A:middle
these tasks each time you

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:12.736 A:middle
perform a build.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:14.876 A:middle
And since there can be tens of

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:16.926 A:middle
thousands of tasks or even more

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.436 A:middle
involved in a build process with

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:19.386 A:middle
a complex graph of

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:20.346 A:middle
interdependencies.

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:21.616 A:middle
It's definitely not something

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:22.626 A:middle
you want to be manually typing

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:23.776 A:middle
into the terminal 110 times a

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:24.056 A:middle
day.

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:27.176 A:middle
Let the build system do that for

00:03:27.176 --> 00:03:27.316 A:middle
you.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.276 A:middle
Now I mentioned that the tasks

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.446 A:middle
in the build process are

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.976 A:middle
executed in a particular order.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:35.506 A:middle
Let's talk about how that

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.226 A:middle
ordering is determined and why

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:37.836 A:middle
it's important.

00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:40.036 A:middle
The order in which build tasks

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:42.116 A:middle
are executed is determined from

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:43.456 A:middle
the dependency information that

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.476 A:middle
is the tasks, the inputs that a

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:47.426 A:middle
task consumes, and the outputs

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:48.096 A:middle
that it produces.

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:51.166 A:middle
For example, a compilation task

00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:52.976 A:middle
consumes a source code file like

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:55.636 A:middle
PetController.m as input and

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.146 A:middle
produces an object file like

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:59.146 A:middle
PetController.o as output.
