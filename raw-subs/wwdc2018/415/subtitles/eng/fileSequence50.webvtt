If you're using some sort of

00:50:00.996 --> 00:50:02.376 A:middle
non-symbol behavior like a

00:50:02.376 --> 00:50:04.486 A:middle
static initializer, or you're

00:50:04.486 --> 00:50:05.616 A:middle
re-exporting them as part of

00:50:05.616 --> 00:50:06.916 A:middle
your own dylib, you may need to

00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:08.286 A:middle
explicitly use something like

00:50:09.096 --> 00:50:11.276 A:middle
force load or all load to the

00:50:11.416 --> 00:50:12.446 A:middle
linker to tell it bring in

00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:13.266 A:middle
everything.

00:50:13.266 --> 00:50:14.256 A:middle
Or these files, even though

00:50:14.256 --> 00:50:15.106 A:middle
there's no linkage.

00:50:15.666 --> 00:50:19.786 A:middle
So let's go through an example

00:50:19.786 --> 00:50:20.776 A:middle
to try to tie this altogether.

00:50:23.236 --> 00:50:25.686 A:middle
So up on stage we have an

00:50:25.686 --> 00:50:28.136 A:middle
example of a playSound function

00:50:28.136 --> 00:50:29.186 A:middle
because what fun would be

00:50:29.186 --> 00:50:29.996 A:middle
looking at pets without

00:50:29.996 --> 00:50:32.076 A:middle
listening to them?

00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:35.896 A:middle
And you know it calls playSound.

00:50:35.896 --> 00:50:36.906 A:middle
You know, there's a function on

00:50:36.906 --> 00:50:37.956 A:middle
cat that calls playSound.

00:50:37.956 --> 00:50:38.926 A:middle
That seems pretty simple.

00:50:38.926 --> 00:50:40.576 A:middle
So let's look at the assembly

00:50:40.576 --> 00:50:41.176 A:middle
that generates.

00:50:41.176 --> 00:50:45.476 A:middle
So here's cat.o that comes out

00:50:45.476 --> 00:50:46.966 A:middle
of it.

00:50:46.966 --> 00:50:49.766 A:middle
Now if we look, we can see we

00:50:49.766 --> 00:50:53.116 A:middle
have the string purr.aac which

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:54.846 A:middle
would be our AAC sound file.

00:50:54.916 --> 00:50:57.406 A:middle
And that gets copied into cat.o.

00:50:57.406 --> 00:50:58.856 A:middle
You'll note that the name purr

00:50:58.856 --> 00:51:00.196 A:middle
file does not appear in there
