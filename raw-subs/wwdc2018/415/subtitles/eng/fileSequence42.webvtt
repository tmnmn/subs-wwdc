00:41:55.726 --> 00:42:00.536 A:middle
to test it from your unit tests.

00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:02.246 A:middle
When importing a module, the

00:42:02.246 --> 00:42:04.596 A:middle
compiler deserializes a special

00:42:04.596 --> 00:42:06.876 A:middle
Swift module file to check the

00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:07.966 A:middle
types when you use them.

00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:10.896 A:middle
For example, in this unit test,

00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.066 A:middle
the compiler will load the

00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:14.426 A:middle
PetViewController parts of the

00:42:14.426 --> 00:42:16.496 A:middle
PetWall Swift module to make

00:42:16.496 --> 00:42:17.456 A:middle
sure that you're creating the

00:42:17.456 --> 00:42:18.506 A:middle
controller correctly.

00:42:19.836 --> 00:42:20.956 A:middle
This is similar to how the

00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:22.716 A:middle
compiler finds declarations

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:24.516 A:middle
within a target as I showed you

00:42:24.516 --> 00:42:24.936 A:middle
earlier.

00:42:26.026 --> 00:42:27.816 A:middle
Except that here, the compiler

00:42:27.816 --> 00:42:29.356 A:middle
loads a file summarizing the

00:42:29.356 --> 00:42:31.826 A:middle
module rather than parsing Swift

00:42:31.826 --> 00:42:32.976 A:middle
files directly.

00:42:36.096 --> 00:42:38.006 A:middle
The compiler produces this Swift

00:42:38.006 --> 00:42:40.006 A:middle
module file a lot like a

00:42:40.006 --> 00:42:41.576 A:middle
generated Objective-C header.

00:42:42.386 --> 00:42:43.786 A:middle
But instead of text, it's a

00:42:43.786 --> 00:42:45.096 A:middle
binary representation.

00:42:46.116 --> 00:42:47.266 A:middle
It includes the bodies of

00:42:47.266 --> 00:42:48.976 A:middle
inlineable functions much like

00:42:48.976 --> 00:42:50.206 A:middle
static inline functions in

00:42:50.206 --> 00:42:51.726 A:middle
Objective-C or header

00:42:51.726 --> 00:42:53.756 A:middle
implementations in C++.

00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:56.756 A:middle
However, one thing to be aware

00:42:56.756 --> 00:42:58.876 A:middle
of is that it does include the

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.546 A:middle
names and types of private
