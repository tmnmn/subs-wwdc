00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.556 A:middle
I say you shouldn't rely on this

00:18:04.556 --> 00:18:04.876 A:middle
feature.

00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:08.406 A:middle
The reason is we keep this there

00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:10.226 A:middle
to keep existing projects

00:18:10.226 --> 00:18:13.076 A:middle
working but there might be

00:18:13.076 --> 00:18:14.356 A:middle
issues down the road with Clang

00:18:14.356 --> 00:18:17.476 A:middle
modules so we suggest that you

00:18:17.726 --> 00:18:20.396 A:middle
always specify the framework

00:18:20.396 --> 00:18:22.416 A:middle
name when you include a public

00:18:22.556 --> 00:18:24.336 A:middle
or private header file from your

00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:25.306 A:middle
own framework.

00:18:27.136 --> 00:18:29.576 A:middle
Third entry is a project header.

00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:31.376 A:middle
In this case, this is not

00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:31.856 A:middle
required.

00:18:32.806 --> 00:18:35.006 A:middle
And the whole purpose of the

00:18:35.006 --> 00:18:37.276 A:middle
headermap is to point back to

00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:38.296 A:middle
your source code.

00:18:38.296 --> 00:18:41.376 A:middle
As you can see, we do the same

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:42.936 A:middle
thing for the public and private

00:18:42.986 --> 00:18:43.246 A:middle
headers.

00:18:44.296 --> 00:18:45.986 A:middle
We always point back to your

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:47.076 A:middle
source code.

00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:49.656 A:middle
We do this so that Clang can

00:18:49.716 --> 00:18:52.126 A:middle
produce useful error and warning

00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:54.526 A:middle
messages for the files in your

00:18:54.526 --> 00:18:56.376 A:middle
source directory and not a

00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:57.746 A:middle
potential copy that might be

00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:00.606 A:middle
somewhere else in the build
