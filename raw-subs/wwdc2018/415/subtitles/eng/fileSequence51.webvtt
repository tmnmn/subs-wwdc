00:50:58.856 --> 00:51:00.196 A:middle
file does not appear in there

00:51:00.196 --> 00:51:00.756 A:middle
anywhere.

00:51:01.176 --> 00:51:02.816 A:middle
The reason is, that's a static.

00:51:02.816 --> 00:51:03.836 A:middle
And those of you who are

00:51:03.836 --> 00:51:04.836 A:middle
familiar with C, that means it's

00:51:04.836 --> 00:51:06.166 A:middle
a nonexported name.

00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:07.386 A:middle
Nobody else can refer to it.

00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:08.806 A:middle
Since nobody else can refer to

00:51:08.806 --> 00:51:10.016 A:middle
it, we don't need it.

00:51:10.016 --> 00:51:10.856 A:middle
It's not included.

00:51:14.326 --> 00:51:17.286 A:middle
And then we see Cat purr becomes

00:51:17.286 --> 00:51:19.536 A:middle
an actual symbol: dash, open

00:51:19.536 --> 00:51:20.976 A:middle
bracket, Cat purr, close

00:51:20.976 --> 00:51:22.746 A:middle
bracket.

00:51:23.596 --> 00:51:24.686 A:middle
Pretty much what you'd expect.

00:51:24.686 --> 00:51:27.946 A:middle
And then we see we actually have

00:51:27.946 --> 00:51:29.446 A:middle
to get this variable we're going

00:51:29.446 --> 00:51:30.746 A:middle
to pass into playSound.

00:51:30.746 --> 00:51:32.196 A:middle
And you'll note there are two

00:51:32.196 --> 00:51:33.556 A:middle
instructions referring to that.

00:51:33.556 --> 00:51:36.476 A:middle
And that's because we don't know

00:51:36.476 --> 00:51:38.206 A:middle
where this string is going to

00:51:38.206 --> 00:51:39.406 A:middle
end up in the final executable.

00:51:39.406 --> 00:51:40.866 A:middle
We don't have a concrete address

00:51:40.866 --> 00:51:41.386 A:middle
for it.

00:51:41.616 --> 00:51:43.646 A:middle
But we know that on RM64 which

00:51:43.646 --> 00:51:45.046 A:middle
is what this assembly is, it

00:51:45.586 --> 00:51:46.386 A:middle
could take at most two

00:51:46.386 --> 00:51:46.936 A:middle
instructions.

00:51:46.936 --> 00:51:48.116 A:middle
So the compiler leaves us with

00:51:48.116 --> 00:51:48.866 A:middle
two instructions.

00:51:49.126 --> 00:51:50.426 A:middle
And it leaves the symbolic

00:51:50.426 --> 00:51:52.636 A:middle
offset, the symbolic values page

00:51:52.636 --> 00:51:53.986 A:middle
and page off that the linker

00:51:53.986 --> 00:51:55.176 A:middle
will come in and fix up later.

00:51:56.206 --> 00:51:59.406 A:middle
Finally, now that we've loaded

00:51:59.406 --> 00:52:03.096 A:middle
that string into x0, we can call
