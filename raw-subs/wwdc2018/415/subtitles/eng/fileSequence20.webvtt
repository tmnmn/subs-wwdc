00:19:59.536 --> 00:20:00.256 A:middle
is in our SDK.

00:20:00.296 --> 00:20:03.086 A:middle
We can do the same thing we did

00:20:03.086 --> 00:20:05.526 A:middle
before when you were looking for

00:20:05.526 --> 00:20:06.296 A:middle
our own header files.

00:20:06.416 --> 00:20:07.246 A:middle
But now we're looking for the

00:20:07.246 --> 00:20:07.786 A:middle
system header.

00:20:08.866 --> 00:20:11.386 A:middle
It's just that headermaps are

00:20:11.386 --> 00:20:13.486 A:middle
only for your own headers.

00:20:13.956 --> 00:20:15.076 A:middle
So we can ignore them.

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:17.976 A:middle
Let's focus on the include path

00:20:18.056 --> 00:20:18.256 A:middle
[inaudible] matter.

00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:21.716 A:middle
So at default, we always look in

00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:23.466 A:middle
two directories in the SDK.

00:20:23.966 --> 00:20:25.746 A:middle
the first one is user include,

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.616 A:middle
the second one is system library

00:20:28.616 --> 00:20:29.176 A:middle
frameworks.

00:20:29.866 --> 00:20:31.346 A:middle
Let's have a look at the first

00:20:31.346 --> 00:20:31.486 A:middle
one.

00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:34.276 A:middle
It's a regular include

00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:35.056 A:middle
directory.

00:20:35.416 --> 00:20:36.746 A:middle
So the only thing we have to do

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:38.426 A:middle
is we have to append the search

00:20:38.426 --> 00:20:38.726 A:middle
term.

00:20:38.816 --> 00:20:39.476 A:middle
In this case,

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:43.026 A:middle
Foundation/Foundation.h. And we

00:20:43.026 --> 00:20:44.166 A:middle
won't find the header because

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:44.516 A:middle
it's not there.

00:20:45.556 --> 00:20:46.076 A:middle
But it's okay.

00:20:46.216 --> 00:20:47.436 A:middle
Let's try the next entry.

00:20:48.616 --> 00:20:50.126 A:middle
Let's look into system library

00:20:50.126 --> 00:20:50.746 A:middle
frameworks.

00:20:52.196 --> 00:20:53.276 A:middle
This one is a frameworks

00:20:53.326 --> 00:20:55.506 A:middle
directory that means Clang has

00:20:55.536 --> 00:20:56.746 A:middle
to behave a little bit

00:20:56.796 --> 00:20:57.216 A:middle
different.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.026 A:middle
First of all, it has to identify
