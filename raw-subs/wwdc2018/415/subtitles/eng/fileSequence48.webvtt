00:47:55.956 --> 00:48:00.256 A:middle
There are also TBD files, or

00:48:00.346 --> 00:48:02.156 A:middle
text-based dylib stubs.

00:48:02.156 --> 00:48:03.286 A:middle
So what are those?

00:48:04.036 --> 00:48:08.286 A:middle
Well, when we made the SDKs for

00:48:08.286 --> 00:48:10.256 A:middle
iOS and macOS, we had all these

00:48:10.296 --> 00:48:11.336 A:middle
dylibs with all these great

00:48:11.336 --> 00:48:13.146 A:middle
functions like MapKit and WebKit

00:48:13.146 --> 00:48:14.296 A:middle
that you may want to use.

00:48:14.816 --> 00:48:15.966 A:middle
But we don't want to ship the

00:48:15.966 --> 00:48:17.326 A:middle
entire copy of those with the

00:48:17.326 --> 00:48:18.856 A:middle
SDK because it would be large.

00:48:18.856 --> 00:48:21.096 A:middle
Ant the compiler and linker

00:48:21.096 --> 00:48:21.606 A:middle
don't need.

00:48:21.606 --> 00:48:22.826 A:middle
It's only needed to run the

00:48:22.826 --> 00:48:23.236 A:middle
program.

00:48:23.236 --> 00:48:24.106 A:middle
So instead we create what's

00:48:24.106 --> 00:48:25.356 A:middle
called a stub dylib where we

00:48:25.356 --> 00:48:27.156 A:middle
delete the bodies of all of the

00:48:27.156 --> 00:48:27.966 A:middle
symbols and we just have the

00:48:27.966 --> 00:48:28.716 A:middle
names.

00:48:29.456 --> 00:48:31.176 A:middle
And then once we did that, we've

00:48:31.176 --> 00:48:32.526 A:middle
made a textual representation of

00:48:32.526 --> 00:48:33.576 A:middle
them that are easier for us to

00:48:33.576 --> 00:48:33.866 A:middle
use.

00:48:33.866 --> 00:48:35.536 A:middle
Currently, they are only used

00:48:35.766 --> 00:48:38.056 A:middle
for distributing the SDKs to

00:48:38.056 --> 00:48:38.876 A:middle
reduce size.

00:48:40.246 --> 00:48:41.566 A:middle
So you may see them in your

00:48:41.566 --> 00:48:42.596 A:middle
project, but you don't have to

00:48:42.596 --> 00:48:43.246 A:middle
worry about them.

00:48:43.246 --> 00:48:45.016 A:middle
And they only contain symbols.

00:48:46.226 --> 00:48:47.166 A:middle
Finally, we have static

00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:48.106 A:middle
archives.

00:48:48.526 --> 00:48:53.086 A:middle
So static archives are just

00:48:53.086 --> 00:48:54.626 A:middle
collections of .o files that

00:48:54.626 --> 00:48:56.746 A:middle
have been built with the AR tool

00:48:56.746 --> 00:48:59.226 A:middle
or in some cases the lib the lib

00:48:59.226 --> 00:49:00.156 A:middle
tool which is a wrapper for
