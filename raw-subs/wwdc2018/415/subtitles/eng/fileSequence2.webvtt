00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.986 A:middle
So let's first understand what

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:02.726 A:middle
the build process is and how it

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:03.916 A:middle
works when building a typical

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:05.466 A:middle
app like PetWall in Xcode.

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.136 A:middle
You can see here we've got an

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:08.936 A:middle
app target, a framework, a bunch

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:10.175 A:middle
of different source code files

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:11.526 A:middle
in Swift and Objective-C.

00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:13.176 A:middle
And maybe this looks a bit like

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:13.786 A:middle
your own project.

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:18.036 A:middle
So when you build an app,

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.116 A:middle
there's a number of steps

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:21.586 A:middle
involved to go from the source

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:22.956 A:middle
code and resources in your

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:24.686 A:middle
project to the package that

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.086 A:middle
you're shipping to customers or

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:27.476 A:middle
uploading to the App Store for

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:28.086 A:middle
distribution.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.486 A:middle
You have to compile and link

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:31.576 A:middle
source code.

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:33.916 A:middle
Copy and process resources like

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:35.756 A:middle
headers, asset catalogues and

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:36.676 A:middle
storyboards.

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:39.066 A:middle
And finally code sign and maybe

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.166 A:middle
even do some custom work in a

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.776 A:middle
shell script or a make file like

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.516 A:middle
building API documentation for

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.706 A:middle
your framework or running code

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:47.036 A:middle
linting and validation tools.

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:49.996 A:middle
Now most of these tasks in the

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:51.396 A:middle
build process are performed by

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:52.456 A:middle
running command line tools.

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.956 A:middle
Like Clang, LD, AC tool, IB

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:56.676 A:middle
tool, Code sign, and so on.

00:02:57.446 --> 00:02:59.036 A:middle
These tools have to be executed

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
with a very specific set of
