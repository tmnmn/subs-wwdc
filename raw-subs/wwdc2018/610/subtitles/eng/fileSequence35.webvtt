00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:00.726 A:middle
device, we can also guide the

00:35:00.726 --> 00:35:01.956 A:middle
user to better localization

00:35:01.956 --> 00:35:02.346 A:middle
process.

00:35:03.116 --> 00:35:04.856 A:middle
So, when we are, again, in the

00:35:04.856 --> 00:35:06.776 A:middle
acquisition device, when we are

00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:08.196 A:middle
in the map state we can take a

00:35:08.196 --> 00:35:10.296 A:middle
picture of the scene and then,

00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:11.496 A:middle
ship that together with the

00:35:11.496 --> 00:35:11.946 A:middle
World map.

00:35:11.986 --> 00:35:13.596 A:middle
And on the receiving end we can

00:35:13.596 --> 00:35:16.026 A:middle
ask the user find this view to

00:35:16.026 --> 00:35:17.766 A:middle
start your shared experience.

00:35:18.386 --> 00:35:20.946 A:middle
That was how to acquire the

00:35:20.946 --> 00:35:21.336 A:middle
World map.

00:35:21.506 --> 00:35:22.876 A:middle
Now, let's see how you can share

00:35:22.876 --> 00:35:24.666 A:middle
the World map.

00:35:24.966 --> 00:35:26.366 A:middle
First, you can get the World map

00:35:26.366 --> 00:35:27.386 A:middle
by simply calling the

00:35:27.496 --> 00:35:29.926 A:middle
getCurrentWorldMap method in the

00:35:29.926 --> 00:35:30.536 A:middle
ARSession.

00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:32.596 A:middle
And this will give you the World

00:35:33.186 --> 00:35:33.286 A:middle
map.

00:35:34.376 --> 00:35:37.156 A:middle
The World map is a serializable

00:35:37.156 --> 00:35:37.476 A:middle
class.

00:35:37.566 --> 00:35:38.856 A:middle
So, then we can simply use

00:35:38.956 --> 00:35:40.576 A:middle
NSKeyedArchiver utility to

00:35:40.576 --> 00:35:42.106 A:middle
serialize it to a binary stream

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:44.446 A:middle
of data, which then, you can

00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:46.276 A:middle
either save to disk in case of a

00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:48.086 A:middle
single user persistent

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:48.946 A:middle
application.

00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:52.126 A:middle
Or you can share it across

00:35:52.156 --> 00:35:52.636 A:middle
devices.

00:35:52.906 --> 00:35:54.626 A:middle
And for that, you can use the

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.176 A:middle
MultiPeerConnectivity framework,

00:35:56.936 --> 00:35:58.196 A:middle
which has great feature like

00:35:58.196 --> 00:36:00.186 A:middle
automatic device, nearby device
