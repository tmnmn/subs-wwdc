00:37:59.186 --> 00:38:00.306 A:middle
top of the physical world.

00:38:00.536 --> 00:38:01.686 A:middle
And on the physical world,

00:38:01.686 --> 00:38:02.866 A:middle
images are found everywhere.

00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:05.226 A:middle
Think about [inaudible] the

00:38:05.226 --> 00:38:07.086 A:middle
world, magazine covers,

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:08.336 A:middle
advertisements.

00:38:08.816 --> 00:38:10.136 A:middle
Image tracking is a tool that

00:38:10.136 --> 00:38:11.506 A:middle
allows you to recognize those

00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:13.976 A:middle
physical images and build

00:38:14.216 --> 00:38:15.366 A:middle
augmented reality experiences

00:38:15.366 --> 00:38:15.876 A:middle
around them.

00:38:17.876 --> 00:38:18.746 A:middle
Let's see an example.

00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:21.896 A:middle
You can see here; two images

00:38:21.896 --> 00:38:23.356 A:middle
being tracked simultaneously.

00:38:24.426 --> 00:38:26.766 A:middle
On the left, a beautiful

00:38:27.206 --> 00:38:29.376 A:middle
elephant is put on top of the

00:38:29.376 --> 00:38:30.716 A:middle
physical image of the elephant.

00:38:31.606 --> 00:38:32.896 A:middle
On the right, the physical image

00:38:32.896 --> 00:38:35.116 A:middle
turned into a virtual screen.

00:38:36.186 --> 00:38:37.626 A:middle
Note also, that the images can

00:38:37.626 --> 00:38:39.016 A:middle
freely move around the

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:40.966 A:middle
environment as tracking around

00:38:40.966 --> 00:38:42.146 A:middle
at 60 frames per second.

00:38:43.306 --> 00:38:45.146 A:middle
Let's talk about looking at

00:38:45.146 --> 00:38:46.866 A:middle
what's happening behind the

00:38:47.156 --> 00:38:47.476 A:middle
scenes.

00:38:47.476 --> 00:38:48.996 A:middle
So, let's say you have an image

00:38:48.996 --> 00:38:50.526 A:middle
like this one of the elephant

00:38:50.896 --> 00:38:52.186 A:middle
and you want to find it in a

00:38:52.236 --> 00:38:52.876 A:middle
scene like this.

00:38:54.266 --> 00:38:55.556 A:middle
We're using grayscale for this.

00:38:55.556 --> 00:38:56.956 A:middle
And the first type is pretty

00:38:56.956 --> 00:38:58.426 A:middle
similar to what we do in

00:38:58.426 --> 00:38:58.836 A:middle
tracking.

00:38:58.936 --> 00:38:59.956 A:middle
So, we'll track those
