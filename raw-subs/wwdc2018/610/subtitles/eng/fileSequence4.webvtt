00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:01.496 A:middle
built-in input system from your

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:02.666 A:middle
device for ARKit.

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:07.066 A:middle
Now, after processing the

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.306 A:middle
results are returned in ARFrames

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:10.926 A:middle
at 60 frames per second.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:14.226 A:middle
An ARFrame is a snapshot in time

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:15.396 A:middle
which gives you everything you

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:17.055 A:middle
need to render your augmented

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:17.875 A:middle
reality scene.

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:20.776 A:middle
Like, the captured camera image,

00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:22.326 A:middle
which would then be, which will

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:23.576 A:middle
be rendered in the background of

00:04:23.576 --> 00:04:25.176 A:middle
your augmented reality scenario.

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:27.136 A:middle
As well as a track camera

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:29.456 A:middle
motion, which will then be

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.256 A:middle
applied to your virtual camera

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:34.406 A:middle
to render the virtual content

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:36.746 A:middle
from the same perspective as the

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:37.586 A:middle
physical camera.

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.426 A:middle
It also contains information

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:42.086 A:middle
about the environment.

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:43.146 A:middle
Like, for example, detected

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:43.536 A:middle
plates.

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:46.806 A:middle
So, let's now start with our

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:48.436 A:middle
first tracking technology and

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:49.216 A:middle
build up from there.

00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:53.176 A:middle
Orientation Tracking.

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:56.396 A:middle
Orientation Tracking tracks,

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:56.976 A:middle
guess what?

00:04:57.176 --> 00:04:58.156 A:middle
Orientation.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.746 A:middle
Meaning it tracks the rotation,
