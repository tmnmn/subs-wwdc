00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:00.426 A:middle
acquired by the tracking system.

00:33:00.776 --> 00:33:02.516 A:middle
You can [inaudible] is the table

00:33:03.096 --> 00:33:04.566 A:middle
and the chair around it.

00:33:05.136 --> 00:33:06.956 A:middle
There's a few things to pay

00:33:06.956 --> 00:33:08.106 A:middle
attention to during this

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.276 A:middle
acquisition process.

00:33:10.076 --> 00:33:11.986 A:middle
First, everything that Marion

00:33:11.986 --> 00:33:13.396 A:middle
said during tracking also

00:33:13.396 --> 00:33:13.946 A:middle
applies here.

00:33:14.456 --> 00:33:15.606 A:middle
So, we want enough visual

00:33:15.606 --> 00:33:17.356 A:middle
complexity on the scene to get

00:33:17.446 --> 00:33:18.626 A:middle
dense feature points on the map.

00:33:19.546 --> 00:33:21.276 A:middle
And the scene must be static.

00:33:22.086 --> 00:33:22.856 A:middle
Of course, we can deal with

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:24.276 A:middle
minor changes, as you have seen

00:33:24.276 --> 00:33:25.466 A:middle
the tablecloth moving by the

00:33:25.466 --> 00:33:25.716 A:middle
wind.

00:33:26.026 --> 00:33:27.216 A:middle
But the scene must be mostly

00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:27.956 A:middle
static.

00:33:29.036 --> 00:33:30.606 A:middle
In addition, when we are

00:33:30.606 --> 00:33:31.936 A:middle
specifically acquiring a World

00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:33.856 A:middle
map for sharing we want to go

00:33:33.856 --> 00:33:35.316 A:middle
around the environment from

00:33:35.316 --> 00:33:36.636 A:middle
multiple points of view.

00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:38.746 A:middle
In particular, we want to cover

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:41.046 A:middle
all the direction from which we

00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:42.786 A:middle
want to later be localized from.

00:33:45.366 --> 00:33:46.926 A:middle
To make this easy, we also made

00:33:47.356 --> 00:33:50.296 A:middle
available a world mapping status

00:33:50.296 --> 00:33:51.736 A:middle
which gives you information

00:33:51.736 --> 00:33:52.566 A:middle
about the World map.

00:33:53.446 --> 00:33:54.816 A:middle
If you guys have been to the

00:33:54.816 --> 00:33:56.066 A:middle
What's New in ARKit talk,

00:33:56.636 --> 00:33:57.506 A:middle
[inaudible] greatly expand this

00:33:57.546 --> 00:33:58.936 A:middle
to quickly recap.

00:33:59.576 --> 00:34:00.766 A:middle
When you start the session the
