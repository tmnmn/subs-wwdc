00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
This technology provides a

00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:05.276 A:middle
higher accuracy, but at the cost

00:09:05.276 --> 00:09:06.546 A:middle
of computation time.

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.176 A:middle
Also, this technology is

00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:12.596 A:middle
sensitive to fast camera motions

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:14.396 A:middle
and this results in motion blur

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:15.296 A:middle
in the camera frames.

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:18.626 A:middle
Now, this version only part of

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.926 A:middle
the system is also called Visual

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:21.666 A:middle
Odometry.

00:09:22.016 --> 00:09:24.276 A:middle
Now, by fusing those both

00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:26.576 A:middle
systems, computer vision and

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:28.916 A:middle
motion, ARKit takes the best of

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:30.016 A:middle
those both systems.

00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:32.086 A:middle
From computer version, it takes

00:09:32.086 --> 00:09:34.116 A:middle
a high accuracy over the larger

00:09:34.116 --> 00:09:34.946 A:middle
time intervals.

00:09:35.566 --> 00:09:37.576 A:middle
And from the motion data it

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.586 A:middle
takes the high update rates and

00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:41.356 A:middle
good precision for the smaller

00:09:41.356 --> 00:09:43.446 A:middle
time intervals, as well as the

00:09:43.446 --> 00:09:44.276 A:middle
metric scale.

00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:47.456 A:middle
Now, by combining those both

00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:49.446 A:middle
systems World Tracking can skip

00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:51.036 A:middle
the computer version processing

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:52.886 A:middle
for some of those frames, while

00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:54.736 A:middle
still keeping an efficient and

00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:55.966 A:middle
responsive tracking.

00:09:56.956 --> 00:09:58.856 A:middle
This frees CPU resources, which

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:00.356 A:middle
you can then, additionally, use
