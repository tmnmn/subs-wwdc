00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.526 A:middle
interesting points from both the

00:39:01.526 --> 00:39:03.256 A:middle
reference image and the current

00:39:03.316 --> 00:39:03.566 A:middle
scene.

00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:05.996 A:middle
And then, we try to go in the

00:39:05.996 --> 00:39:07.356 A:middle
current scene and match those

00:39:07.356 --> 00:39:08.616 A:middle
features to the one on the

00:39:08.616 --> 00:39:09.346 A:middle
reference image.

00:39:10.436 --> 00:39:11.696 A:middle
By applying some projected

00:39:11.696 --> 00:39:12.866 A:middle
geometry and linear algebra,

00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:14.366 A:middle
this is enough to give an

00:39:14.456 --> 00:39:16.126 A:middle
initial estimation of the

00:39:16.126 --> 00:39:17.286 A:middle
position orientation of the

00:39:17.286 --> 00:39:18.556 A:middle
image with respect to the

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:19.156 A:middle
current scene.

00:39:20.516 --> 00:39:21.386 A:middle
But we don't stop here.

00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:23.486 A:middle
In order to give you a really

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.836 A:middle
precise pose and track at 60

00:39:25.836 --> 00:39:27.846 A:middle
frames per second, we then do a

00:39:27.846 --> 00:39:29.276 A:middle
dense tracking stage.

00:39:29.986 --> 00:39:31.316 A:middle
So, with that initial estimate

00:39:31.976 --> 00:39:33.136 A:middle
we take the pixels from the

00:39:33.136 --> 00:39:36.486 A:middle
current scene and warp them back

00:39:36.566 --> 00:39:38.266 A:middle
to a rectangular shape like you

00:39:38.266 --> 00:39:40.616 A:middle
see on the right-- top right

00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:40.916 A:middle
there.

00:39:41.306 --> 00:39:42.776 A:middle
So, that's a reconstructed image

00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:45.296 A:middle
by warping the pixels of the

00:39:45.296 --> 00:39:46.576 A:middle
current image into the

00:39:46.576 --> 00:39:46.986 A:middle
rectangle.

00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:48.766 A:middle
We can then compare the

00:39:48.766 --> 00:39:50.456 A:middle
reconstructed image with a

00:39:50.506 --> 00:39:51.726 A:middle
reference image that we have

00:39:51.726 --> 00:39:54.056 A:middle
available to create an error

00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:55.106 A:middle
image like the one you see

00:39:55.106 --> 00:39:55.436 A:middle
below.

00:39:56.636 --> 00:39:58.296 A:middle
We then optimize the position

00:39:58.296 --> 00:39:59.836 A:middle
orientation of the image, such

00:39:59.906 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
that that error is minimized.
