00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:02.676 A:middle
It is, actually, quite simple.

00:06:03.106 --> 00:06:05.016 A:middle
It only uses the rotation data

00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:07.166 A:middle
from core motion, which applies

00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:09.146 A:middle
sensor fusion to the motion

00:06:09.146 --> 00:06:09.986 A:middle
sensors data.

00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:13.626 A:middle
As motion data is provided at a

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.696 A:middle
higher frequency than the camera

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:17.936 A:middle
image, Orientation Tracking

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:20.736 A:middle
takes the latest motion data

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:22.616 A:middle
from commotion, once the camera

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:23.636 A:middle
image is available.

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.766 A:middle
And then, returns both results

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:27.206 A:middle
in an ARFrame.

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:28.066 A:middle
So, that's it.

00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:28.956 A:middle
Very simple.

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:31.726 A:middle
So, please note that the camera

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:33.266 A:middle
feed is not processed in

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:34.526 A:middle
Orientation Tracking.

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:35.956 A:middle
Meaning there's no computer

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.036 A:middle
version under the hood here.

00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:40.376 A:middle
Now, to run Orientation Tracking

00:06:40.986 --> 00:06:43.096 A:middle
you only need to configure your

00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:45.876 A:middle
ARSession with an AROrientation

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:47.256 A:middle
TrackingConfiguration.

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:49.686 A:middle
The results will then be

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.216 A:middle
returned in an ARCamera object

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.116 A:middle
provided by the ARFrames.

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:57.926 A:middle
Now, an ARCamera object always

00:06:57.926 --> 00:06:59.826 A:middle
contains the transform, which in

00:06:59.826 --> 00:07:01.106 A:middle
this case of Orientation
