00:20:58.406 --> 00:21:00.846 A:middle
the lower left, gets worse when

00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:03.926 A:middle
the camera is covered while we

00:21:03.926 --> 00:21:05.576 A:middle
are still moving and exploring

00:21:05.576 --> 00:21:06.296 A:middle
the environment.

00:21:07.796 --> 00:21:09.596 A:middle
It also shows how it returns

00:21:09.596 --> 00:21:11.336 A:middle
back to normal after the camera

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.496 A:middle
view is uncovered.

00:21:14.036 --> 00:21:16.066 A:middle
Now, ARKit simplifies its

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.586 A:middle
information for you by providing

00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:19.596 A:middle
a tracking state.

00:21:20.466 --> 00:21:22.186 A:middle
And the tracking state can have

00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:23.426 A:middle
three different values.

00:21:23.426 --> 00:21:26.776 A:middle
It can be normal, which is the

00:21:26.856 --> 00:21:29.676 A:middle
healthy state and is the case in

00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:30.546 A:middle
most of the time.

00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:31.566 A:middle
It's the case in most of the

00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:31.956 A:middle
times.

00:21:32.506 --> 00:21:34.096 A:middle
And it can also be limited,

00:21:34.236 --> 00:21:35.396 A:middle
which is whenever tracking

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:36.426 A:middle
performs poorly.

00:21:37.486 --> 00:21:40.116 A:middle
If that's the case, then the

00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:42.056 A:middle
limited state will also come

00:21:42.056 --> 00:21:43.786 A:middle
along with the reason, like

00:21:43.946 --> 00:21:45.406 A:middle
insufficient features or

00:21:45.406 --> 00:21:47.766 A:middle
excessive motion or being

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.606 A:middle
currently in the initialization

00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:49.966 A:middle
phase.

00:21:50.716 --> 00:21:53.496 A:middle
It can also be not available,

00:21:53.496 --> 00:21:55.256 A:middle
which means that tracking did

00:21:55.256 --> 00:21:56.086 A:middle
not start yet.

00:21:57.116 --> 00:21:58.826 A:middle
Now, whenever the tracking state

00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:01.146 A:middle
changes, a delegate is called.
