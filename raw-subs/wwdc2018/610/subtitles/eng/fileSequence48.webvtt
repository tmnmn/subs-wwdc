00:48:01.476 --> 00:48:03.846 A:middle
Another example, if you happen

00:48:03.846 --> 00:48:05.226 A:middle
to know where an image is

00:48:05.346 --> 00:48:06.916 A:middle
physically located in the world,

00:48:08.296 --> 00:48:09.826 A:middle
like for example, you know that

00:48:09.826 --> 00:48:11.446 A:middle
the map of this park is in the

00:48:11.446 --> 00:48:12.076 A:middle
physical world.

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.446 A:middle
You can use image tracking to

00:48:14.446 --> 00:48:15.956 A:middle
get the position of the device

00:48:15.956 --> 00:48:17.576 A:middle
with respect to the image and,

00:48:17.576 --> 00:48:19.636 A:middle
therefore, also the position of

00:48:19.636 --> 00:48:20.656 A:middle
the device with respect to the

00:48:20.656 --> 00:48:21.946 A:middle
world, which, you can then use,

00:48:21.946 --> 00:48:23.956 A:middle
for example, to overlay

00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:26.396 A:middle
directions really attached to

00:48:26.396 --> 00:48:27.086 A:middle
the physical world.

00:48:27.646 --> 00:48:31.376 A:middle
So, that concludes the image

00:48:31.436 --> 00:48:31.836 A:middle
tracking.

00:48:31.836 --> 00:48:34.006 A:middle
Let's now go and look at the

00:48:34.066 --> 00:48:35.266 A:middle
Object Detection.

00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:39.546 A:middle
So, with image tracking we have

00:48:39.546 --> 00:48:41.716 A:middle
seen how we can detect images,

00:48:41.716 --> 00:48:43.676 A:middle
which are planar objects in the

00:48:43.676 --> 00:48:44.406 A:middle
physical world.

00:48:45.376 --> 00:48:46.786 A:middle
Object detection extends this

00:48:46.786 --> 00:48:48.256 A:middle
concept to the third dimension

00:48:48.346 --> 00:48:49.806 A:middle
allowing the detection of more

00:48:49.806 --> 00:48:50.586 A:middle
generic objects.

00:48:51.046 --> 00:48:53.626 A:middle
Note, though, that this object

00:48:53.816 --> 00:48:55.826 A:middle
will be assumed to be static in

00:48:55.826 --> 00:48:57.086 A:middle
the scene, unlike images that

00:48:57.086 --> 00:48:57.676 A:middle
can move around.

00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:00.046 A:middle
We can see an example here.
