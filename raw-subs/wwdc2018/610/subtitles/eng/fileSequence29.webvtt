00:28:59.686 --> 00:29:01.486 A:middle
to any updates.

00:29:01.666 --> 00:29:02.926 A:middle
Now, what can you do with

00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:03.366 A:middle
planes?

00:29:04.866 --> 00:29:05.956 A:middle
Like what we've seen before on

00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:07.296 A:middle
the Ikea app, these are great

00:29:07.296 --> 00:29:07.796 A:middle
examples.

00:29:08.026 --> 00:29:09.496 A:middle
Place virtual objects, for

00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:10.916 A:middle
example, with hit testing.

00:29:12.046 --> 00:29:13.606 A:middle
Or you can interact with some,

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:15.186 A:middle
for example, physically.

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:17.846 A:middle
Like we've seen bouncing is a

00:29:17.846 --> 00:29:18.706 A:middle
possibility.

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:21.966 A:middle
Or you can also use it by adding

00:29:21.966 --> 00:29:23.226 A:middle
an occlusion plane into the

00:29:23.226 --> 00:29:25.346 A:middle
detected plane, which will then

00:29:25.496 --> 00:29:27.286 A:middle
hide all the virtual content

00:29:27.336 --> 00:29:30.036 A:middle
below or behind the added

00:29:30.036 --> 00:29:30.916 A:middle
occlusion plane.

00:29:32.616 --> 00:29:34.436 A:middle
So, let me summarize what we've

00:29:34.436 --> 00:29:35.386 A:middle
already gone through.

00:29:36.536 --> 00:29:37.756 A:middle
We've had a look at the

00:29:37.816 --> 00:29:41.176 A:middle
Orientation Tracking, the World

00:29:41.286 --> 00:29:43.816 A:middle
Tracking, and the Plane

00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:44.386 A:middle
Detection.

00:29:45.306 --> 00:29:47.666 A:middle
Next, Michele will explain, in

00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:48.986 A:middle
depth, our new tracking

00:29:48.986 --> 00:29:50.316 A:middle
technologies, which were

00:29:50.386 --> 00:29:52.976 A:middle
introduced in ARKit 2.

00:29:53.046 --> 00:29:54.246 A:middle
So, welcome Michele.

00:29:55.176 --> 00:29:57.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Marion.
