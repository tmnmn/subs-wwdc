feature points of the Nefertiti

00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:01.886 A:middle
statue there on the left.

00:50:03.056 --> 00:50:04.876 A:middle
And to scan the object, you can

00:50:05.006 --> 00:50:06.516 A:middle
use the Scanning and Detecting

00:50:06.516 --> 00:50:08.496 A:middle
3D Objects developer sample

00:50:08.496 --> 00:50:10.416 A:middle
that's available on the website.

00:50:11.706 --> 00:50:13.136 A:middle
And note here, that the

00:50:13.136 --> 00:50:14.766 A:middle
detection quality that you will

00:50:14.766 --> 00:50:17.306 A:middle
get at runtime, later, is highly

00:50:17.306 --> 00:50:18.616 A:middle
affected by the quality of the

00:50:18.616 --> 00:50:18.986 A:middle
scan.

00:50:19.776 --> 00:50:21.826 A:middle
So, let's spend a few moments to

00:50:21.826 --> 00:50:23.266 A:middle
see how we can get the best

00:50:23.336 --> 00:50:27.386 A:middle
quality during the scanning.

00:50:27.546 --> 00:50:29.066 A:middle
Once you build and run this

00:50:29.066 --> 00:50:30.666 A:middle
developer sample you will see

00:50:30.786 --> 00:50:31.916 A:middle
something like this on your

00:50:31.916 --> 00:50:32.406 A:middle
device.

00:50:33.286 --> 00:50:35.976 A:middle
The first step is to find the

00:50:35.976 --> 00:50:37.566 A:middle
region of space around your

00:50:37.566 --> 00:50:37.926 A:middle
object.

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.066 A:middle
The application will try to

00:50:40.066 --> 00:50:41.556 A:middle
automatically estimate this

00:50:41.586 --> 00:50:42.946 A:middle
bounding box, exploring

00:50:42.946 --> 00:50:43.946 A:middle
different feature points.

00:50:44.896 --> 00:50:46.206 A:middle
But you can always adjust this

00:50:46.256 --> 00:50:48.856 A:middle
box by dragging on a side to

00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:50.726 A:middle
shrink it or make it larger.

00:50:52.876 --> 00:50:54.506 A:middle
Note here, that what is really

00:50:54.506 --> 00:50:55.766 A:middle
important that when you go

00:50:55.766 --> 00:50:57.266 A:middle
around the object you make sure

00:50:57.266 --> 00:50:58.796 A:middle
that you don't cut any of the

00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:00.806 A:middle
interesting points of the
