00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:01.146 A:middle
changes, a delegate is called.

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:03.636 A:middle
The camera did change tracking

00:22:03.636 --> 00:22:04.076 A:middle
state.

00:22:05.216 --> 00:22:06.116 A:middle
And this gives you the

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.666 A:middle
opportunity to notify the user

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:10.346 A:middle
when a limited state has been

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.096 A:middle
encountered.

00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:13.226 A:middle
You should, then, give

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:15.426 A:middle
informative and actionable

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:17.936 A:middle
feedback what the user can do to

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.626 A:middle
improve his tracking situation,

00:22:20.136 --> 00:22:22.566 A:middle
as most of it is actually in the

00:22:22.566 --> 00:22:23.396 A:middle
user's hand.

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:25.706 A:middle
Like for example, as we learned

00:22:25.706 --> 00:22:27.996 A:middle
before, like a sidewise movement

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:30.656 A:middle
to allow initialization or

00:22:31.206 --> 00:22:32.236 A:middle
making sure there's enough

00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:34.316 A:middle
adequate lightning for enough

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:35.646 A:middle
visual complexity.

00:22:36.236 --> 00:22:39.646 A:middle
So, let me wrap up the World

00:22:39.646 --> 00:22:40.446 A:middle
Tracking for you.

00:22:42.136 --> 00:22:46.156 A:middle
World Tracking tracks your

00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:48.046 A:middle
camera 6 degree of freedom

00:22:48.276 --> 00:22:51.556 A:middle
orientation and position with

00:22:51.556 --> 00:22:53.356 A:middle
respect to your surrounding

00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:55.286 A:middle
environment and without any

00:22:55.286 --> 00:22:56.916 A:middle
prior information about your

00:22:56.916 --> 00:22:59.066 A:middle
environment, which then allows

00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:01.866 A:middle
the physical world augmentation
