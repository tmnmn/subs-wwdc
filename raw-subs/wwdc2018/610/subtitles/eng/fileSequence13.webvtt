00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:01.016 A:middle
Now, to place virtual content

00:13:01.066 --> 00:13:03.416 A:middle
correctly to an ARSession, you

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.256 A:middle
should use ARAnchors from ARKit,

00:13:06.636 --> 00:13:07.826 A:middle
which are denoted with an A

00:13:07.826 --> 00:13:08.096 A:middle
here.

00:13:09.536 --> 00:13:12.326 A:middle
ARAnchors are reference points

00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:14.076 A:middle
within this World map, within

00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:15.816 A:middle
this world coordinates system.

00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:18.386 A:middle
And you should use them because

00:13:18.386 --> 00:13:20.686 A:middle
the World Tracking might update

00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:22.206 A:middle
them during the tracking.

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:23.636 A:middle
Meaning that, also, all the

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.336 A:middle
virtual content that is assigned

00:13:25.336 --> 00:13:27.776 A:middle
to it will be updated and

00:13:27.886 --> 00:13:31.626 A:middle
correctly augmented into the

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:32.746 A:middle
camera's view.

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:34.446 A:middle
So, now that you've used the

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.436 A:middle
ARAnchors you can add virtual

00:13:36.466 --> 00:13:38.356 A:middle
content to the anchor, which

00:13:38.386 --> 00:13:40.496 A:middle
will them be augmented correctly

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:44.116 A:middle
into the current camera's view.

00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:48.676 A:middle
From now on, this created 3D

00:13:48.676 --> 00:13:51.026 A:middle
World map of your environment is

00:13:51.026 --> 00:13:52.526 A:middle
your reference system for the

00:13:52.526 --> 00:13:53.236 A:middle
World Tracking.

00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:55.506 A:middle
It is used to reference new

00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:56.456 A:middle
images against.

00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:58.796 A:middle
And features are matched from

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.806 A:middle
image to image and triangulated.
