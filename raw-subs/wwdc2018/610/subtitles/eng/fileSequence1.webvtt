00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.046 A:middle
kind of tracking technologies,

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.876 A:middle
as well as some basics and

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.676 A:middle
terminology used in augmented

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.756 A:middle
reality, which will then help

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.176 A:middle
you to create your very own

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:09.416 A:middle
first augmented reality

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.016 A:middle
experience.

00:01:10.726 --> 00:01:14.586 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:17.926 A:middle
What's tracking?

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.536 A:middle
Tracking provides your camera

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.906 A:middle
viewing position and orientation

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:24.956 A:middle
into your physical environment,

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:26.806 A:middle
which will then allow you to

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:29.036 A:middle
augment virtual content into

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.096 A:middle
your camera's view.

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:33.656 A:middle
In this video, for example, the

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:35.836 A:middle
front table and the chairs is

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:39.206 A:middle
virtual content augmented on top

00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:41.416 A:middle
of the real physical terrace.

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.006 A:middle
This, by the way, is Ikea.

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:47.186 A:middle
And the virtual content will

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:48.926 A:middle
appear always virtually correct.

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:52.086 A:middle
Correct placement, correct size,

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:53.816 A:middle
and correct perspective

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:54.516 A:middle
appearance.

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.836 A:middle
So, different tracking

00:01:56.836 --> 00:01:58.906 A:middle
technologies are just providing

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.606 A:middle
a difference reference system
