00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:03.216 A:middle
The detected planes are returned

00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:05.006 A:middle
as an ARPlaneAnchor.

00:28:05.936 --> 00:28:07.996 A:middle
An ARPlaneAnchor is a subclass

00:28:07.996 --> 00:28:08.946 A:middle
of an ARAnchor.

00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:11.696 A:middle
Each ARAnchor provides a

00:28:11.876 --> 00:28:14.476 A:middle
transform containing the

00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:16.326 A:middle
information where the anchor is

00:28:16.606 --> 00:28:17.566 A:middle
in your World map.

00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:20.216 A:middle
Now, a plane anchor,

00:28:20.216 --> 00:28:21.436 A:middle
specifically, also has

00:28:21.436 --> 00:28:24.026 A:middle
information about the geometry

00:28:24.026 --> 00:28:25.886 A:middle
of the surface of the plane,

00:28:26.816 --> 00:28:27.856 A:middle
which is represented in two

00:28:27.856 --> 00:28:28.976 A:middle
alternative ways.

00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:31.256 A:middle
Either like a bounding box with

00:28:31.256 --> 00:28:35.096 A:middle
a center and an extent, or as a

00:28:35.096 --> 00:28:37.306 A:middle
3D mesh describing the shape of

00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:39.336 A:middle
the convex hull of the detected

00:28:39.386 --> 00:28:41.306 A:middle
plane and its geometry property.

00:28:42.636 --> 00:28:44.646 A:middle
To get notified about detected

00:28:44.736 --> 00:28:48.266 A:middle
planes, delegates are going to

00:28:48.266 --> 00:28:51.266 A:middle
be called whenever planes are

00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:53.676 A:middle
added, updated, or removed.

00:28:54.656 --> 00:28:57.086 A:middle
This will then allow you to use

00:28:57.086 --> 00:28:59.566 A:middle
those planes, as well as react

00:28:59.686 --> 00:29:01.486 A:middle
to any updates.
