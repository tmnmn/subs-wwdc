00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:00.806 A:middle
interesting points of the

00:51:00.806 --> 00:51:01.166 A:middle
object.

00:51:01.856 --> 00:51:03.606 A:middle
You can also, rotate the box

00:51:03.606 --> 00:51:04.956 A:middle
with a two-finger gesture from

00:51:04.996 --> 00:51:05.146 A:middle
top.

00:51:05.856 --> 00:51:08.406 A:middle
So, make sure that this box is

00:51:08.606 --> 00:51:09.666 A:middle
around the object and not

00:51:09.696 --> 00:51:11.286 A:middle
cutting any interesting part of

00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:11.986 A:middle
it.

00:51:13.016 --> 00:51:14.746 A:middle
The next part is the actual

00:51:14.746 --> 00:51:15.246 A:middle
scanning.

00:51:16.376 --> 00:51:19.356 A:middle
In this phase what we want to do

00:51:19.356 --> 00:51:21.426 A:middle
is really go around the objects

00:51:21.736 --> 00:51:23.486 A:middle
from all the points of view that

00:51:23.486 --> 00:51:24.846 A:middle
you think your users will want

00:51:24.846 --> 00:51:25.806 A:middle
to detect it later.

00:51:27.056 --> 00:51:28.386 A:middle
In order to make it easy for you

00:51:28.386 --> 00:51:30.096 A:middle
to understand which part of the

00:51:30.096 --> 00:51:31.656 A:middle
objects have been, already,

00:51:31.656 --> 00:51:33.376 A:middle
acquired like this beautiful

00:51:33.376 --> 00:51:34.356 A:middle
tile representation.

00:51:34.726 --> 00:51:36.046 A:middle
And you also can see a

00:51:36.456 --> 00:51:37.676 A:middle
percentage on top which tells

00:51:37.676 --> 00:51:38.786 A:middle
you how many tiles have already

00:51:38.786 --> 00:51:39.366 A:middle
been acquired.

00:51:40.406 --> 00:51:41.786 A:middle
And it's really important in

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:43.716 A:middle
this phase that you spend time

00:51:43.716 --> 00:51:45.126 A:middle
on the regions of the object

00:51:45.126 --> 00:51:46.546 A:middle
which have a lot of features

00:51:46.726 --> 00:51:47.726 A:middle
that are distinctive enough.

00:51:47.726 --> 00:51:49.446 A:middle
And you go close enough to

00:51:49.446 --> 00:51:50.346 A:middle
capture all the details.

00:51:50.686 --> 00:51:52.046 A:middle
And again, that you really go

00:51:52.046 --> 00:51:56.246 A:middle
around from all the sides.

00:51:56.436 --> 00:51:59.456 A:middle
Like you see here.

00:51:59.686 --> 00:52:01.186 A:middle
Once you're happy with the
