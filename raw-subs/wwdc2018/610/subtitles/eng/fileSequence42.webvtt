00:41:59.776 --> 00:42:01.066 A:middle
great with image tracking.

00:42:01.156 --> 00:42:03.426 A:middle
They have high texture, high

00:42:03.426 --> 00:42:04.956 A:middle
level of contrast, well

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:06.376 A:middle
distributed histograms, as well

00:42:06.376 --> 00:42:07.356 A:middle
as they do not contain

00:42:07.356 --> 00:42:08.416 A:middle
repetitive structures.

00:42:08.536 --> 00:42:10.486 A:middle
There are, also, other kinds of

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:12.316 A:middle
images that will work less good

00:42:12.316 --> 00:42:12.936 A:middle
with the system.

00:42:13.436 --> 00:42:14.726 A:middle
You can see an example of this

00:42:15.456 --> 00:42:16.176 A:middle
on the right.

00:42:17.116 --> 00:42:19.606 A:middle
And if we take a look at these

00:42:19.696 --> 00:42:21.596 A:middle
top two examples, you can see

00:42:21.596 --> 00:42:23.466 A:middle
that the good image we have a

00:42:23.466 --> 00:42:25.036 A:middle
lot of those interesting points.

00:42:25.536 --> 00:42:26.306 A:middle
And you can see that the

00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:27.716 A:middle
histogram is well distributed

00:42:27.716 --> 00:42:28.686 A:middle
across the whole range.

00:42:29.316 --> 00:42:30.126 A:middle
While, [inaudible] image,

00:42:30.126 --> 00:42:33.096 A:middle
there's only a few of those

00:42:33.096 --> 00:42:34.286 A:middle
interesting points and the

00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:36.116 A:middle
histogram is all skewed toward

00:42:36.116 --> 00:42:36.536 A:middle
the whites.

00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:40.536 A:middle
You can get an estimation of how

00:42:40.536 --> 00:42:42.066 A:middle
good an image will be directly

00:42:42.066 --> 00:42:42.916 A:middle
in Xcode.

00:42:44.076 --> 00:42:46.066 A:middle
As soon as you drag an image in

00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:48.396 A:middle
there, the image is analyzed and

00:42:48.576 --> 00:42:50.316 A:middle
[inaudible] to you in the form

00:42:50.316 --> 00:42:52.206 A:middle
of warnings to give you early

00:42:52.276 --> 00:42:53.826 A:middle
feedback, even before you run

00:42:53.826 --> 00:42:54.516 A:middle
your application.

00:42:55.646 --> 00:42:56.666 A:middle
For example, if you click on

00:42:56.666 --> 00:42:59.086 A:middle
this bottom image that could be

00:42:59.086 --> 00:43:01.836 A:middle
a magazine page, for example, we
