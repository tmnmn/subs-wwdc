00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:00.636 A:middle
results in slightly different

00:11:00.636 --> 00:11:02.236 A:middle
views into the environment,

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:04.706 A:middle
which allows you to see stereo

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:06.056 A:middle
and perceive the depth.

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:08.406 A:middle
And this is what ARKit now,

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:10.176 A:middle
also, does with the different

00:11:10.176 --> 00:11:12.076 A:middle
views of the same camera stream

00:11:12.076 --> 00:11:12.956 A:middle
during the process of

00:11:13.026 --> 00:11:14.156 A:middle
triangulation.

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:16.206 A:middle
And it does it once there's

00:11:16.256 --> 00:11:18.046 A:middle
enough parallax present.

00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:20.786 A:middle
It computes the missing depth

00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:22.736 A:middle
information for those matched

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:23.306 A:middle
features.

00:11:23.706 --> 00:11:26.826 A:middle
Meaning those 2D features from

00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:28.556 A:middle
the image are now reconstructed

00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:29.316 A:middle
in 3D.

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:32.066 A:middle
Please, note that this

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.476 A:middle
reconstruction to be successful,

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.536 A:middle
the camera position must have

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:39.776 A:middle
changed by a translation to

00:11:39.776 --> 00:11:41.316 A:middle
provide enough parallax.

00:11:42.356 --> 00:11:44.086 A:middle
For example, with the sidewise

00:11:44.086 --> 00:11:44.626 A:middle
movement.

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:47.746 A:middle
The pure rotation does not give

00:11:47.746 --> 00:11:48.856 A:middle
enough information here.

00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:52.606 A:middle
So, this is your first small map

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:53.646 A:middle
of your environment.

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.826 A:middle
In ARKit we call this a World

00:11:55.906 --> 00:11:56.136 A:middle
map.

00:11:57.396 --> 00:11:59.826 A:middle
In this same moment, also, the

00:11:59.826 --> 00:12:01.626 A:middle
camera's positions and
