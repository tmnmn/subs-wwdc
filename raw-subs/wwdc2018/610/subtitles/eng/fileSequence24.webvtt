00:23:58.886 --> 00:24:00.036 A:middle
tracking experience.

00:24:01.456 --> 00:24:04.586 A:middle
So, World Tracking is about the

00:24:04.586 --> 00:24:06.566 A:middle
camera-- where your camera is

00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:08.526 A:middle
with respect to your physical

00:24:08.526 --> 00:24:09.186 A:middle
environment.

00:24:10.156 --> 00:24:13.026 A:middle
Let's now talk about how the

00:24:13.026 --> 00:24:14.536 A:middle
virtual content can interact

00:24:14.836 --> 00:24:16.776 A:middle
with the physical environment.

00:24:17.136 --> 00:24:19.156 A:middle
And this is possible with Plane

00:24:19.156 --> 00:24:19.726 A:middle
Detection.

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:24.876 A:middle
The following video, again, from

00:24:24.876 --> 00:24:26.576 A:middle
the Ikea app, shows a great use

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:28.146 A:middle
case for the Plane Detection,

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:30.626 A:middle
placing virtual objects into

00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.566 A:middle
your physical environment, and

00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:34.426 A:middle
then interacting with it.

00:24:35.296 --> 00:24:37.786 A:middle
So first, please note how, also,

00:24:37.786 --> 00:24:39.256 A:middle
in the Ikea app the user is

00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:41.156 A:middle
guided to make some movement.

00:24:42.296 --> 00:24:44.326 A:middle
Then, once a horizontal plane is

00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:46.796 A:middle
detected, the virtual table set

00:24:46.796 --> 00:24:48.836 A:middle
is displayed and is waiting to

00:24:48.836 --> 00:24:49.916 A:middle
be placed by you.

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:52.856 A:middle
Once you position it, rotate it

00:24:52.856 --> 00:24:54.646 A:middle
as you want it, you can lock the

00:24:54.646 --> 00:24:55.886 A:middle
object in its environment.

00:24:56.126 --> 00:24:56.976 A:middle
And did you notice the

00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:59.206 A:middle
interaction between the detected

00:24:59.256 --> 00:25:01.156 A:middle
ground plane and the table set
