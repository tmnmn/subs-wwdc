00:47:00.866 --> 00:47:02.766 A:middle
You will then start receiving

00:47:02.766 --> 00:47:04.306 A:middle
the results, for example, to the

00:47:04.306 --> 00:47:06.346 A:middle
session, didUpdate anchors

00:47:06.466 --> 00:47:08.266 A:middle
delegate method, where you can

00:47:08.266 --> 00:47:10.096 A:middle
check if the anchors is of type

00:47:10.146 --> 00:47:11.156 A:middle
ARImageAnchor.

00:47:12.606 --> 00:47:14.186 A:middle
In the anchor, you will find, of

00:47:14.246 --> 00:47:15.386 A:middle
course, the position and

00:47:15.386 --> 00:47:17.336 A:middle
orientation of the image, as

00:47:17.336 --> 00:47:18.216 A:middle
well as the reference image

00:47:18.216 --> 00:47:18.656 A:middle
itself.

00:47:18.716 --> 00:47:19.856 A:middle
Where you can find, for example,

00:47:19.856 --> 00:47:21.836 A:middle
the name of the image as you

00:47:21.836 --> 00:47:23.156 A:middle
named it in the actual title so

00:47:23.156 --> 00:47:24.126 A:middle
that you know which image has

00:47:24.126 --> 00:47:24.746 A:middle
been detected.

00:47:25.986 --> 00:47:26.966 A:middle
There's also another Boolean

00:47:26.966 --> 00:47:28.936 A:middle
property, which tells you if

00:47:28.936 --> 00:47:30.086 A:middle
this image is currently being

00:47:30.086 --> 00:47:33.666 A:middle
tracked in the frame.

00:47:33.866 --> 00:47:35.306 A:middle
Note here that other than these

00:47:35.306 --> 00:47:36.496 A:middle
use cases that we have seen so

00:47:36.496 --> 00:47:38.576 A:middle
far when you build [inaudible]

00:47:38.576 --> 00:47:40.546 A:middle
around images, image detection

00:47:40.546 --> 00:47:43.196 A:middle
and tracking allows a few more

00:47:43.976 --> 00:47:44.126 A:middle
things.

00:47:45.226 --> 00:47:47.496 A:middle
For example, if two devices are

00:47:47.496 --> 00:47:48.866 A:middle
looking at the same physical

00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:51.446 A:middle
image, you can detect this image

00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:52.416 A:middle
from both devices.

00:47:52.846 --> 00:47:54.586 A:middle
And this will give you a shared

00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:56.066 A:middle
coordinate system that you can

00:47:56.066 --> 00:47:57.626 A:middle
then use as an alternative way

00:47:58.106 --> 00:47:59.386 A:middle
to have a shared experience.
