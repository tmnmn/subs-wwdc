00:25:58.006 --> 00:26:00.676 A:middle
the same physical surface are

00:26:00.676 --> 00:26:02.876 A:middle
detected, like in this part now,

00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:04.636 A:middle
the green and the purple one,

00:26:05.226 --> 00:26:06.726 A:middle
then they will be merged once

00:26:06.726 --> 00:26:07.926 A:middle
they start overlapping.

00:26:08.596 --> 00:26:11.356 A:middle
If horizontal and vertical

00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:13.026 A:middle
planes intersect they are

00:26:13.026 --> 00:26:14.366 A:middle
clipped at the line of

00:26:14.366 --> 00:26:15.666 A:middle
intersection, which is actually

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:18.156 A:middle
a new feature in ARKit 2.

00:26:19.876 --> 00:26:21.776 A:middle
Plane Detection is designed to

00:26:21.776 --> 00:26:24.686 A:middle
have very little overhead as it

00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:27.166 A:middle
repurposes the mapped 3D points

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:28.296 A:middle
from the World Tracking.

00:26:29.086 --> 00:26:31.166 A:middle
And then it fits planes into

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:33.386 A:middle
those point clouds and over time

00:26:33.696 --> 00:26:36.346 A:middle
continuously aggregates more and

00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:38.326 A:middle
more points and merge the planes

00:26:38.606 --> 00:26:40.286 A:middle
that start to overlap.

00:26:40.936 --> 00:26:42.516 A:middle
Therefore, it takes some time

00:26:42.516 --> 00:26:44.156 A:middle
until the first planes are

00:26:44.156 --> 00:26:44.806 A:middle
detected.

00:26:46.096 --> 00:26:47.276 A:middle
What does that mean for you?

00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:50.726 A:middle
If your app is started, there

00:26:50.726 --> 00:26:53.036 A:middle
might not directly be planes to

00:26:53.036 --> 00:26:55.516 A:middle
place objects on or to interact

00:26:55.626 --> 00:26:55.846 A:middle
with.

00:26:57.266 --> 00:26:58.786 A:middle
If the detection of a plane is

00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:01.496 A:middle
mandatory for your experience,
