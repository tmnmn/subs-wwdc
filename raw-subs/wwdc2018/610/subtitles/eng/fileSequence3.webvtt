00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.556 A:middle
So, the first thing you'll do is

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:01.826 A:middle
create an ARSession.

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:04.576 A:middle
An ARSession is the object that

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:06.946 A:middle
handles everything from

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:09.686 A:middle
configuring to running the AR

00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:11.226 A:middle
technologies.

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.226 A:middle
And also, returning the results

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.696 A:middle
of the AR technologies.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.406 A:middle
You then, have to describe what

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
kind of technologies you

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:21.866 A:middle
actually want to run.

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:23.256 A:middle
Like, what kind of tracking

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.136 A:middle
technologies and what kind of

00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:26.376 A:middle
features should be enabled, like

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:28.096 A:middle
Plane Detection, for example.

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:32.506 A:middle
You'll then, take this specific

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:35.406 A:middle
ARConfiguration and call run

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:39.476 A:middle
method on your instance of the

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:40.116 A:middle
ARSession.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.206 A:middle
Then, the ARSession, internally,

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:47.336 A:middle
will start configuring an

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:49.596 A:middle
AVCaptureSession to start

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.716 A:middle
receiving the images, as well as

00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:55.096 A:middle
a call motion manager to begin

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:56.816 A:middle
receiving the motion sensor, so,

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:57.616 A:middle
data.

00:03:57.616 --> 00:03:58.626 A:middle
So, this is, basically, the

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:01.496 A:middle
built-in input system from your
