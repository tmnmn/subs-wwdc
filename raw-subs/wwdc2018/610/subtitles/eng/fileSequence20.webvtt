00:19:59.726 --> 00:20:01.176 A:middle
motion sensor would actually

00:20:01.176 --> 00:20:02.706 A:middle
sense a motion like going up or

00:20:02.706 --> 00:20:04.476 A:middle
down in the elevator while,

00:20:04.476 --> 00:20:06.766 A:middle
visually, your environment had

00:20:06.816 --> 00:20:07.566 A:middle
not changed.

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:11.846 A:middle
So, how can you get notified

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.966 A:middle
about the tracking quality that

00:20:14.036 --> 00:20:15.036 A:middle
the user is currently

00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:16.926 A:middle
experiencing with your app?

00:20:18.236 --> 00:20:19.916 A:middle
ARKit monitors its tracking

00:20:19.916 --> 00:20:20.586 A:middle
performance.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.776 A:middle
We applied machine learning,

00:20:23.076 --> 00:20:24.536 A:middle
which was trained on thousands

00:20:24.536 --> 00:20:26.546 A:middle
of data sets to which we had the

00:20:26.546 --> 00:20:28.706 A:middle
information how well tracking

00:20:28.706 --> 00:20:30.266 A:middle
performed in those situations.

00:20:31.776 --> 00:20:33.276 A:middle
To train a classifier, which

00:20:33.276 --> 00:20:35.036 A:middle
tells you how tracking performs,

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.846 A:middle
we used annotations like the

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:39.486 A:middle
number of visual-- visible

00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.136 A:middle
features tracked in the image

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.576 A:middle
and also, the current velocity

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:44.346 A:middle
of the device.

00:20:45.496 --> 00:20:47.866 A:middle
Now, during runtime, the health

00:20:47.866 --> 00:20:50.636 A:middle
of tracking is determined based

00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:51.746 A:middle
on those parameters.

00:20:52.616 --> 00:20:55.116 A:middle
In this video, we can see how

00:20:55.116 --> 00:20:57.026 A:middle
the health estimate, which can

00:20:57.026 --> 00:20:58.406 A:middle
be seen-- which, is reported in

00:20:58.406 --> 00:21:00.846 A:middle
the lower left, gets worse when
