00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.806 A:middle
image to image and triangulated.

00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:04.216 A:middle
And at the same time, also, new

00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:05.776 A:middle
robust features are extracted,

00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:08.246 A:middle
matched, and triangulated, which

00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:10.496 A:middle
are then extending your World

00:14:10.556 --> 00:14:10.786 A:middle
map.

00:14:11.286 --> 00:14:13.346 A:middle
Meaning ARKit is learning your

00:14:13.346 --> 00:14:14.036 A:middle
environment.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:17.006 A:middle
This then allows, again, the

00:14:17.006 --> 00:14:18.686 A:middle
computation of tracking updates

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:20.936 A:middle
of the current camera's position

00:14:20.936 --> 00:14:21.956 A:middle
and orientation.

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:24.986 A:middle
And finally, the correct

00:14:24.986 --> 00:14:26.796 A:middle
augmentation into the current

00:14:26.796 --> 00:14:27.426 A:middle
camera's view.

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:31.966 A:middle
While you continue to explore

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:33.786 A:middle
the world, World Tracking will

00:14:33.786 --> 00:14:35.706 A:middle
continue to track your physical

00:14:35.706 --> 00:14:37.826 A:middle
camera and continue to learn

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:39.426 A:middle
your physical environment.

00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:42.866 A:middle
But over time, the augmentation

00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:45.506 A:middle
might drift slightly, which can

00:14:45.506 --> 00:14:47.366 A:middle
be noticed like you can see in

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:49.096 A:middle
the left image, in a small

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:51.086 A:middle
offset of the augmentation.

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:54.736 A:middle
This is because even small

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:58.016 A:middle
offsets, even small errors will

00:14:58.016 --> 00:14:59.786 A:middle
become noticeable when

00:14:59.786 --> 00:15:01.496 A:middle
accumulated over time.
