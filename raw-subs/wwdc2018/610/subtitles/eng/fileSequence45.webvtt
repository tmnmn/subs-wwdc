00:44:58.266 --> 00:45:00.606 A:middle
Let's now, see our two

00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:01.916 A:middle
configurations.

00:45:03.006 --> 00:45:05.286 A:middle
The ARImageTrackingConfiguration

00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:06.876 A:middle
is a new standalone image

00:45:06.876 --> 00:45:07.836 A:middle
tracking configuration, which

00:45:07.866 --> 00:45:09.256 A:middle
means it doesn't run the World

00:45:09.256 --> 00:45:09.646 A:middle
Tracking.

00:45:10.636 --> 00:45:11.846 A:middle
Which also, means there is no

00:45:12.136 --> 00:45:12.916 A:middle
world origin.

00:45:13.216 --> 00:45:14.676 A:middle
So, every image will be given to

00:45:14.676 --> 00:45:15.976 A:middle
you with respect to the current

00:45:15.976 --> 00:45:16.526 A:middle
camera view.

00:45:18.246 --> 00:45:19.346 A:middle
You can also combine image

00:45:19.406 --> 00:45:20.906 A:middle
tracking with a World Tracking

00:45:20.906 --> 00:45:21.646 A:middle
configuration.

00:45:22.466 --> 00:45:24.536 A:middle
And in this case, you will have

00:45:24.536 --> 00:45:25.636 A:middle
all the scene understanding

00:45:25.636 --> 00:45:27.506 A:middle
capability available like Plane

00:45:27.506 --> 00:45:29.356 A:middle
Detection, light estimation,

00:45:29.356 --> 00:45:30.026 A:middle
everything else.

00:45:31.066 --> 00:45:32.796 A:middle
So, what is more appropriate to

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.376 A:middle
use which configurations?

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:35.536 A:middle
Let's see.

00:45:35.626 --> 00:45:37.106 A:middle
So, in the

00:45:37.516 --> 00:45:39.916 A:middle
ARImageTrackingConfigurations is

00:45:39.916 --> 00:45:41.226 A:middle
really tailored for use cases

00:45:41.226 --> 00:45:42.906 A:middle
which are built around images.

00:45:43.196 --> 00:45:44.286 A:middle
We can see an example on the

00:45:44.286 --> 00:45:44.826 A:middle
left here.

00:45:46.606 --> 00:45:48.516 A:middle
We can have an image that could

00:45:48.516 --> 00:45:49.666 A:middle
be a page of a textbook.

00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:51.576 A:middle
And to make the experience more

00:45:51.576 --> 00:45:53.976 A:middle
engaging, we are overlaying

00:45:54.286 --> 00:45:54.746 A:middle
[inaudible] graph.

00:45:54.746 --> 00:45:55.846 A:middle
In this case, on how to build an

00:45:55.846 --> 00:45:56.796 A:middle
equilateral triangle.

00:45:57.866 --> 00:45:58.746 A:middle
So, you can see that this

00:45:58.746 --> 00:46:00.256 A:middle
experience is really tailored
