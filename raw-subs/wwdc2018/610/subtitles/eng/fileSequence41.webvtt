00:40:58.426 --> 00:41:01.286 A:middle
The easiest way to add reference

00:41:01.286 --> 00:41:02.836 A:middle
images to your application is

00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:04.746 A:middle
through the, called asset

00:41:04.746 --> 00:41:05.106 A:middle
catalog.

00:41:06.146 --> 00:41:08.066 A:middle
You simply create an AR Resource

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:09.646 A:middle
Groups and drag and drop your

00:41:09.646 --> 00:41:10.386 A:middle
images in there.

00:41:11.566 --> 00:41:13.026 A:middle
Next, you have to set the

00:41:13.026 --> 00:41:14.446 A:middle
physical dimension of the image,

00:41:14.556 --> 00:41:16.196 A:middle
which you can do on the property

00:41:16.196 --> 00:41:17.436 A:middle
window on the top right.

00:41:17.946 --> 00:41:20.656 A:middle
Setting the physical dimension

00:41:21.096 --> 00:41:22.336 A:middle
is a requirement and there's a

00:41:22.336 --> 00:41:23.126 A:middle
few reason for that.

00:41:24.466 --> 00:41:26.126 A:middle
First, it allows the pose of the

00:41:26.126 --> 00:41:27.816 A:middle
image to be in physical scale.

00:41:28.386 --> 00:41:29.776 A:middle
Which means, also, your content

00:41:29.816 --> 00:41:31.076 A:middle
will be in physical scale.

00:41:31.186 --> 00:41:32.666 A:middle
In ARKit, everything is in

00:41:32.666 --> 00:41:33.986 A:middle
meters, so also, your visual

00:41:33.986 --> 00:41:36.226 A:middle
content will be in meters.

00:41:37.056 --> 00:41:38.626 A:middle
In addition, it's especially

00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.266 A:middle
important to set the correct

00:41:40.266 --> 00:41:41.586 A:middle
physical dimension of the image

00:41:41.946 --> 00:41:43.166 A:middle
in case we combine the image

00:41:43.216 --> 00:41:44.046 A:middle
tracking with the World

00:41:44.046 --> 00:41:44.476 A:middle
Tracking.

00:41:44.936 --> 00:41:46.206 A:middle
As this will give immediately

00:41:46.526 --> 00:41:48.616 A:middle
consistent pose between the

00:41:48.616 --> 00:41:51.196 A:middle
image and the world.

00:41:51.196 --> 00:41:52.826 A:middle
Let's see some example of this

00:41:53.256 --> 00:41:54.166 A:middle
reference images.

00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:57.366 A:middle
You can see here, two beautiful

00:41:57.366 --> 00:41:57.806 A:middle
images.

00:41:58.476 --> 00:41:59.776 A:middle
These images will work really

00:41:59.776 --> 00:42:01.066 A:middle
great with image tracking.
