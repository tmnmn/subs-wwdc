00:56:58.926 --> 00:57:00.116 A:middle
loading map features in the

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:00.566 A:middle
architecture.

00:57:01.516 --> 00:57:03.036 A:middle
And how you can detect physical

00:57:03.036 --> 00:57:04.816 A:middle
images and track them at 60

00:57:04.816 --> 00:57:06.096 A:middle
frames per second with the image

00:57:06.096 --> 00:57:08.596 A:middle
tracking and how you can detect

00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:09.916 A:middle
more generic objects with the

00:57:09.916 --> 00:57:11.176 A:middle
object detections.

00:57:12.576 --> 00:57:15.216 A:middle
And with this, I really hope you

00:57:15.216 --> 00:57:15.946 A:middle
guys have a better

00:57:15.946 --> 00:57:17.496 A:middle
understanding, now, of all the

00:57:17.496 --> 00:57:19.126 A:middle
different tracking technology

00:57:19.586 --> 00:57:20.816 A:middle
that are present in ARKit and

00:57:20.816 --> 00:57:22.016 A:middle
how they work behind the scenes.

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.666 A:middle
And how you can get the best

00:57:24.806 --> 00:57:25.976 A:middle
quality out of it.

00:57:26.436 --> 00:57:28.106 A:middle
And we're really looking forward

00:57:28.106 --> 00:57:29.226 A:middle
to see what you guys are going

00:57:29.226 --> 00:57:29.656 A:middle
to do with that.

00:57:30.976 --> 00:57:32.416 A:middle
More information can be found at

00:57:32.486 --> 00:57:33.636 A:middle
the session link in the

00:57:33.636 --> 00:57:34.496 A:middle
developer website.

00:57:34.496 --> 00:57:36.226 A:middle
And we have an ARKit Lab

00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:37.586 A:middle
tomorrow, 9 a.m.

00:57:38.356 --> 00:57:39.806 A:middle
We will both, me and Marion will

00:57:39.806 --> 00:57:41.786 A:middle
be there answering any question

00:57:41.786 --> 00:57:42.666 A:middle
on ARKit you may have.

00:57:43.756 --> 00:57:44.976 A:middle
And with that, thank you, very

00:57:44.976 --> 00:57:46.976 A:middle
much and enjoy the bash.
