00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.746 A:middle
Meaning it tracks the rotation,

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:01.226 A:middle
only.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.206 A:middle
You can think about it as you

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.456 A:middle
can only use your hat to view

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:06.916 A:middle
virtual content, which also,

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.046 A:middle
only allows rotation.

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:11.716 A:middle
Meaning you can experience the

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.406 A:middle
virtual content from the same

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:15.656 A:middle
positional point of view, but no

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.276 A:middle
change in the position is going

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:17.856 A:middle
to be tracked.

00:05:19.596 --> 00:05:21.546 A:middle
The rotation data is tracked

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:22.836 A:middle
around three axles.

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:24.276 A:middle
That's why it's also, sometimes,

00:05:24.316 --> 00:05:25.676 A:middle
called the three degrees of

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:26.416 A:middle
freedom tracking.

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:28.926 A:middle
You can use it, for example, in

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:30.846 A:middle
a spherical virtual environment.

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:32.256 A:middle
Like, for example, experience a

00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:35.066 A:middle
360-degree video, in which the

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.496 A:middle
virtual content can be viewed

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:38.116 A:middle
from the same positional point.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:41.226 A:middle
You can also, use it to augment

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:43.196 A:middle
objects that are very far away.

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:46.296 A:middle
Orientation Tracking is not

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.236 A:middle
suited for physical world

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:49.746 A:middle
augmentation, in which you want

00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:50.886 A:middle
to view the content from

00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:52.666 A:middle
different points of views.

00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:56.416 A:middle
So, let's now have a look at

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.016 A:middle
what happens under the hood when

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:59.486 A:middle
Orientation Tracking is running.
