00:45:58.746 --> 00:46:00.256 A:middle
experience is really tailored

00:46:00.256 --> 00:46:00.966 A:middle
around an image.

00:46:01.116 --> 00:46:03.046 A:middle
If you have, let's see this

00:46:03.046 --> 00:46:03.826 A:middle
other example.

00:46:04.546 --> 00:46:05.516 A:middle
Image tracking is used to

00:46:05.606 --> 00:46:07.266 A:middle
trigger some content that then

00:46:07.266 --> 00:46:09.326 A:middle
goes beyond the extent of the

00:46:09.326 --> 00:46:09.496 A:middle
image.

00:46:09.496 --> 00:46:12.086 A:middle
In this case, you want to use

00:46:12.086 --> 00:46:13.726 A:middle
the ARWorldTrackingConfiguration

00:46:13.806 --> 00:46:14.906 A:middle
as you will need the device

00:46:14.906 --> 00:46:16.506 A:middle
position to keep track of that

00:46:16.506 --> 00:46:19.856 A:middle
content outside the image.

00:46:20.076 --> 00:46:21.146 A:middle
Also, note that the image

00:46:21.246 --> 00:46:23.576 A:middle
tracking doesn't use the motion

00:46:23.576 --> 00:46:24.676 A:middle
data, which means it can also be

00:46:24.676 --> 00:46:26.506 A:middle
used on a bus or an elevator,

00:46:27.076 --> 00:46:28.146 A:middle
where the motion data don't

00:46:28.146 --> 00:46:29.896 A:middle
agree with the visual data.

00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:33.036 A:middle
So, let's see now, how we can do

00:46:33.036 --> 00:46:33.756 A:middle
this in code.

00:46:35.236 --> 00:46:36.916 A:middle
You can easily recognize those

00:46:36.946 --> 00:46:37.716 A:middle
three steps here.

00:46:37.936 --> 00:46:39.836 A:middle
The first one is to gather all

00:46:39.836 --> 00:46:40.476 A:middle
the images.

00:46:40.876 --> 00:46:41.796 A:middle
And there's a convenience

00:46:41.796 --> 00:46:43.396 A:middle
function for that in the

00:46:43.566 --> 00:46:45.436 A:middle
ARReferenceImage class that

00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:47.436 A:middle
gathers all the images that are

00:46:47.436 --> 00:46:48.366 A:middle
in a particular group.

00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:50.226 A:middle
In this case, it's named Room1.

00:46:51.896 --> 00:46:53.256 A:middle
We can then simply set the

00:46:53.256 --> 00:46:55.626 A:middle
trackingImages property to those

00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:56.306 A:middle
images in the

00:46:56.306 --> 00:46:58.156 A:middle
ARImageTrackingConfigurations.

00:46:58.586 --> 00:46:59.516 A:middle
And run the session.
