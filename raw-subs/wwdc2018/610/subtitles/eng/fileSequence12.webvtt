00:11:59.826 --> 00:12:01.626 A:middle
camera's positions and

00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:04.226 A:middle
orientations of your sequences

00:12:04.226 --> 00:12:06.546 A:middle
are computed, denoted with a C

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:06.766 A:middle
here.

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:08.546 A:middle
Meaning, your World Tracking

00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:09.396 A:middle
just initialized.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.496 A:middle
This is the moment of

00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:12.496 A:middle
initialization of the tracking

00:12:12.496 --> 00:12:12.746 A:middle
system.

00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:15.886 A:middle
Please note that also in this

00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:17.326 A:middle
moment of this initial

00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:19.216 A:middle
reconstruction of the World map,

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.246 A:middle
the world origin was defined.

00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:23.676 A:middle
And it is set to the first

00:12:23.886 --> 00:12:25.846 A:middle
camera's origin of the

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:27.326 A:middle
triangulated frames.

00:12:28.046 --> 00:12:29.896 A:middle
And it is also set to be gravity

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:30.296 A:middle
aligned.

00:12:31.056 --> 00:12:33.446 A:middle
It's denoted with a W in the

00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:34.286 A:middle
slides.

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:35.786 A:middle
So, you now have a small

00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:37.246 A:middle
representation of your real

00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:39.366 A:middle
environment reconstructed as a

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:40.896 A:middle
World map in its own world

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:42.046 A:middle
coordinates system.

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:44.446 A:middle
And you have your current camera

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
tracked with respect to the same

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:48.646 A:middle
world coordinate system.

00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:53.186 A:middle
You can now start adding virtual

00:12:53.186 --> 00:12:56.436 A:middle
content to augment them into the

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:57.056 A:middle
camera's view.

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:01.016 A:middle
Now, to place virtual content
