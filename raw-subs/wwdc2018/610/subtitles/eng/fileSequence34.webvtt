00:33:59.576 --> 00:34:00.766 A:middle
When you start the session the

00:34:00.766 --> 00:34:02.196 A:middle
World map status will start

00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:02.776 A:middle
limited.

00:34:02.776 --> 00:34:03.936 A:middle
And then, will switch to a

00:34:04.056 --> 00:34:06.746 A:middle
standing as more of the scene is

00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:07.616 A:middle
learned by the device.

00:34:08.036 --> 00:34:09.176 A:middle
And then, finally, we go to

00:34:09.176 --> 00:34:10.856 A:middle
mapped when the system is

00:34:10.856 --> 00:34:12.156 A:middle
confident you're staying in the

00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:12.766 A:middle
same place.

00:34:13.726 --> 00:34:15.206 A:middle
And that's what you want to save

00:34:15.206 --> 00:34:16.976 A:middle
the map in the mapped state.

00:34:17.626 --> 00:34:20.315 A:middle
So, that's good information.

00:34:20.315 --> 00:34:22.056 A:middle
But this is mostly on the user

00:34:22.056 --> 00:34:24.326 A:middle
side applied to acquire the

00:34:24.326 --> 00:34:24.746 A:middle
session.

00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:26.076 A:middle
So, what does this mean to you

00:34:26.156 --> 00:34:26.926 A:middle
as a developer?

00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:29.085 A:middle
That you need to guide the user.

00:34:30.275 --> 00:34:32.255 A:middle
So, we can indicate the mapping

00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:33.985 A:middle
status and even disabling the

00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:35.835 A:middle
saving or sharing of the World

00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:37.886 A:middle
map until the mapping status

00:34:37.926 --> 00:34:39.476 A:middle
goes to the mapped state.

00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:44.255 A:middle
We can also, monitor the

00:34:44.326 --> 00:34:45.576 A:middle
tracking quality during the

00:34:45.576 --> 00:34:48.696 A:middle
acquisition session and report

00:34:48.926 --> 00:34:50.045 A:middle
to the user if the tracking

00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:51.356 A:middle
state has been limited for more

00:34:51.356 --> 00:34:52.146 A:middle
than a few seconds.

00:34:53.056 --> 00:34:54.356 A:middle
And maybe even give an option to

00:34:54.356 --> 00:34:56.036 A:middle
restart the acquisition session.

00:34:56.476 --> 00:34:58.496 A:middle
On the receiving end of the

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:00.726 A:middle
device, we can also guide the
