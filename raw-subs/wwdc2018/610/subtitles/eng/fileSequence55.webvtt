00:54:59.506 --> 00:55:00.656 A:middle
This time is in the

00:55:00.656 --> 00:55:01.916 A:middle
ARReferenceObjects class.

00:55:02.806 --> 00:55:05.136 A:middle
And to configure your

00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:07.056 A:middle
ARWorldTracking configuration,

00:55:07.056 --> 00:55:08.516 A:middle
you simply pass this object to

00:55:08.516 --> 00:55:10.876 A:middle
the detectionObjects property.

00:55:13.206 --> 00:55:15.566 A:middle
Once you run the session, again,

00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:17.236 A:middle
you will find your results.

00:55:18.306 --> 00:55:19.356 A:middle
And in this case, you want to

00:55:19.356 --> 00:55:21.656 A:middle
check for the ARObjectAnchor,

00:55:22.386 --> 00:55:23.656 A:middle
which will give you the position

00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:25.436 A:middle
and orientation of the object

00:55:25.436 --> 00:55:27.866 A:middle
with respect to the world.

00:55:28.716 --> 00:55:30.346 A:middle
And also, the name of the object

00:55:30.346 --> 00:55:33.086 A:middle
as was given in the asset

00:55:35.016 --> 00:55:35.246 A:middle
catalog.

00:55:35.246 --> 00:55:36.516 A:middle
So, you guys may have noticed

00:55:36.706 --> 00:55:38.316 A:middle
some similarities between the

00:55:38.316 --> 00:55:40.506 A:middle
object detection and the world

00:55:40.506 --> 00:55:42.726 A:middle
mapping relocalization.

00:55:43.426 --> 00:55:44.206 A:middle
But there's also few

00:55:44.206 --> 00:55:44.806 A:middle
differences.

00:55:44.856 --> 00:55:46.316 A:middle
So, in the case of the object

00:55:46.316 --> 00:55:48.406 A:middle
detection we are always giving

00:55:48.746 --> 00:55:50.446 A:middle
the object position with respect

00:55:50.446 --> 00:55:50.946 A:middle
to the world.

00:55:51.506 --> 00:55:52.426 A:middle
While in the world map

00:55:52.426 --> 00:55:53.966 A:middle
relocalization is the camera

00:55:53.966 --> 00:55:56.066 A:middle
itself that adjusts to the

00:55:56.066 --> 00:55:56.816 A:middle
previous world map.

00:55:58.286 --> 00:56:00.306 A:middle
In addition, you can detect
