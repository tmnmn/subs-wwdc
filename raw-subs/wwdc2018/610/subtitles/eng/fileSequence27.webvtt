00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:01.496 A:middle
mandatory for your experience,

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:04.006 A:middle
you should again guide the user

00:27:04.426 --> 00:27:06.006 A:middle
to move the camera with enough

00:27:06.106 --> 00:27:08.956 A:middle
translation to ensure a dense

00:27:08.956 --> 00:27:11.616 A:middle
reconstruction based on the

00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:13.396 A:middle
parallax, and also, enough

00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:15.086 A:middle
visual complexity in the scene.

00:27:15.976 --> 00:27:18.096 A:middle
Again, for the reconstruction, a

00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:20.416 A:middle
rotation only is not enough.

00:27:20.946 --> 00:27:23.856 A:middle
Now, how can you enable the

00:27:23.856 --> 00:27:24.796 A:middle
Plane Detection?

00:27:25.786 --> 00:27:26.966 A:middle
It's, again, very simple.

00:27:27.116 --> 00:27:28.676 A:middle
As the Plane Detection reuses

00:27:28.676 --> 00:27:30.286 A:middle
the 3D map from the World

00:27:30.286 --> 00:27:32.486 A:middle
Tracking, it can be configured

00:27:32.646 --> 00:27:33.316 A:middle
by using the

00:27:33.316 --> 00:27:35.126 A:middle
ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.

00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:38.346 A:middle
Then, the property

00:27:38.346 --> 00:27:40.706 A:middle
planeDetection just needs to be

00:27:40.706 --> 00:27:41.986 A:middle
set to either horizontal,

00:27:41.986 --> 00:27:43.626 A:middle
vertical, or like in this case,

00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:43.926 A:middle
both.

00:27:45.116 --> 00:27:47.446 A:middle
And then, just call your

00:27:47.446 --> 00:27:49.046 A:middle
ARSession with this

00:27:49.106 --> 00:27:50.226 A:middle
configuration.

00:27:50.476 --> 00:27:52.146 A:middle
And the detection of the planes

00:27:52.146 --> 00:27:52.856 A:middle
will be started.

00:27:53.526 --> 00:27:56.086 A:middle
Now, how are those, the results

00:27:56.086 --> 00:27:57.686 A:middle
of the detected planes returned

00:27:57.686 --> 00:27:58.576 A:middle
to you?
