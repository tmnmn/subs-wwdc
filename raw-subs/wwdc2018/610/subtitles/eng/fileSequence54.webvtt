00:53:59.746 --> 00:54:03.016 A:middle
did for the images.

00:54:03.016 --> 00:54:04.526 A:middle
Also note that there are some

00:54:04.526 --> 00:54:05.886 A:middle
objects that will work really

00:54:05.886 --> 00:54:07.366 A:middle
great with this system.

00:54:07.586 --> 00:54:08.706 A:middle
Object like you can see on the

00:54:08.706 --> 00:54:08.986 A:middle
left.

00:54:09.586 --> 00:54:10.956 A:middle
First of all, they are rigid

00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:13.206 A:middle
objects and they are, also, rich

00:54:13.206 --> 00:54:14.696 A:middle
of texture, distinctive enough.

00:54:15.436 --> 00:54:16.416 A:middle
But there are also certain kinds

00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:17.526 A:middle
of object that will not work

00:54:17.686 --> 00:54:18.506 A:middle
well with the system.

00:54:19.066 --> 00:54:21.256 A:middle
You can see an example of this

00:54:21.256 --> 00:54:22.136 A:middle
on the right.

00:54:22.686 --> 00:54:24.756 A:middle
And for example, metallic,

00:54:24.826 --> 00:54:26.606 A:middle
transparent, or metallic or

00:54:26.606 --> 00:54:27.796 A:middle
reflective objects will not

00:54:27.856 --> 00:54:28.096 A:middle
work.

00:54:29.206 --> 00:54:31.496 A:middle
Or transparent objects like

00:54:31.576 --> 00:54:32.796 A:middle
glass material object will also

00:54:32.796 --> 00:54:34.376 A:middle
not work because the appearance

00:54:34.376 --> 00:54:35.236 A:middle
of these objects will really

00:54:35.236 --> 00:54:37.766 A:middle
depend on where they are in the

00:54:38.816 --> 00:54:38.936 A:middle
scene.

00:54:39.756 --> 00:54:41.076 A:middle
So, that was how to scan the

00:54:41.076 --> 00:54:41.506 A:middle
objects.

00:54:41.706 --> 00:54:43.126 A:middle
Again, make sure that you have

00:54:43.126 --> 00:54:44.026 A:middle
well-lit environment.

00:54:44.996 --> 00:54:46.596 A:middle
Let's now see how we can detect

00:54:46.646 --> 00:54:48.056 A:middle
this in ARKit.

00:54:50.046 --> 00:54:51.956 A:middle
If this looks familiar to you,

00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:53.606 A:middle
it's because the API is pretty

00:54:53.606 --> 00:54:54.536 A:middle
similar to the one of the

00:54:54.536 --> 00:54:55.006 A:middle
images.

00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:56.716 A:middle
We'll have convenience metered

00:54:56.816 --> 00:54:58.586 A:middle
to gather all the objects in a

00:54:58.586 --> 00:54:58.896 A:middle
group.

00:54:59.506 --> 00:55:00.656 A:middle
This time is in the
