00:44:00.026 --> 00:44:03.106 A:middle
Another thing that we can do is

00:44:03.436 --> 00:44:06.376 A:middle
use multiple AR Resource Groups.

00:44:07.496 --> 00:44:09.176 A:middle
This allow many more images to

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:10.146 A:middle
be detected.

00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:11.726 A:middle
As with the commands to have a

00:44:11.726 --> 00:44:13.816 A:middle
maximum of 25 images per group

00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:15.296 A:middle
to keep your experience

00:44:15.296 --> 00:44:16.736 A:middle
efficient and responsive.

00:44:17.936 --> 00:44:19.016 A:middle
But you can have as many groups

00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:19.826 A:middle
as you want.

00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:21.896 A:middle
And then, you can switch between

00:44:21.896 --> 00:44:23.156 A:middle
groups programmatically.

00:44:23.376 --> 00:44:26.076 A:middle
For example, if you are want to

00:44:26.076 --> 00:44:27.076 A:middle
create an augmented reality

00:44:27.076 --> 00:44:28.846 A:middle
experience in a museum that may

00:44:28.846 --> 00:44:30.646 A:middle
have hundreds of images.

00:44:31.816 --> 00:44:33.396 A:middle
Usually though, those images are

00:44:33.396 --> 00:44:34.586 A:middle
actually physically located in

00:44:34.586 --> 00:44:35.336 A:middle
different rooms.

00:44:35.646 --> 00:44:37.646 A:middle
So, what you can do is put the

00:44:38.246 --> 00:44:39.756 A:middle
images that physically will be

00:44:39.756 --> 00:44:41.146 A:middle
present in the room into a

00:44:41.146 --> 00:44:41.476 A:middle
group.

00:44:41.686 --> 00:44:43.036 A:middle
And images of another room into

00:44:43.036 --> 00:44:43.596 A:middle
another group.

00:44:44.246 --> 00:44:45.806 A:middle
And then use, for example, core

00:44:45.806 --> 00:44:47.586 A:middle
location to switch between

00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:48.686 A:middle
rooms.

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:52.116 A:middle
Note also, that you can have

00:44:52.446 --> 00:44:53.906 A:middle
similar images, now, as long as

00:44:53.946 --> 00:44:55.126 A:middle
they are in different groups.

00:44:55.896 --> 00:44:57.716 A:middle
So, that was all about reference

00:44:57.746 --> 00:44:58.266 A:middle
images.

00:44:58.266 --> 00:45:00.606 A:middle
Let's now, see our two
