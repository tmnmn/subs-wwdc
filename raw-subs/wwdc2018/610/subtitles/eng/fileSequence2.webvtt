00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.606 A:middle
a difference reference system

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:01.586 A:middle
for the camera.

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.556 A:middle
Meaning the camera with respect

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.246 A:middle
to your world, the camera with

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:07.106 A:middle
respect to an image, or maybe, a

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:07.916 A:middle
3D object.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:11.186 A:middle
And we'll talk about those

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:12.396 A:middle
different kind of tracking

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:14.116 A:middle
technologies in the next hour,

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.476 A:middle
such that you'll be able to make

00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:17.626 A:middle
the right choice for your

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:18.796 A:middle
specific use case.

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:22.296 A:middle
We'll talk about the already

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.196 A:middle
existing AR technologies'

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.726 A:middle
Orientation Tracking, World

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.876 A:middle
Tracking, and Plane Detection.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.376 A:middle
Before we then have a close look

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.466 A:middle
at our new tracking and

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:36.536 A:middle
detection technologies which

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
came out now with ARKit 2.

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:40.316 A:middle
Which are saving and loading

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:43.126 A:middle
maps, image tracking, and object

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:43.776 A:middle
detection.

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:46.926 A:middle
But before diving deep into

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:48.886 A:middle
those technologies, let's start

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:51.416 A:middle
with a very short recap of ARKit

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:52.646 A:middle
like on a high level.

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:54.166 A:middle
This is, specifically,

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.936 A:middle
interesting if you are new to

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:56.276 A:middle
ARKit.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.556 A:middle
So, the first thing you'll do is
