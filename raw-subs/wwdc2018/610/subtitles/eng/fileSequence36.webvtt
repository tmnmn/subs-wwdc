00:35:58.196 --> 00:36:00.186 A:middle
automatic device, nearby device

00:36:00.186 --> 00:36:01.856 A:middle
discovery, and allows efficient

00:36:01.856 --> 00:36:04.356 A:middle
communication of data between

00:36:04.356 --> 00:36:04.876 A:middle
devices.

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:06.996 A:middle
We also, have an example of how

00:36:06.996 --> 00:36:09.396 A:middle
to use that in ARKit called

00:36:09.396 --> 00:36:11.036 A:middle
Creating a Multiuser AR

00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:12.126 A:middle
Experience that you can check

00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.516 A:middle
out on our developer website.

00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:16.836 A:middle
On the receiving end of the

00:36:16.836 --> 00:36:18.086 A:middle
device, once you've got the

00:36:18.086 --> 00:36:20.096 A:middle
World map let's see how you can

00:36:20.096 --> 00:36:21.046 A:middle
set up the World Tracking

00:36:21.046 --> 00:36:22.126 A:middle
configuration to use it.

00:36:22.426 --> 00:36:22.986 A:middle
Very simple.

00:36:22.986 --> 00:36:24.916 A:middle
You just set the initial World

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:27.366 A:middle
map property to that World map.

00:36:28.266 --> 00:36:29.986 A:middle
When you run the session, the

00:36:29.986 --> 00:36:31.426 A:middle
system will try to find that

00:36:31.526 --> 00:36:32.376 A:middle
previous World map.

00:36:33.636 --> 00:36:35.336 A:middle
But it may take some time, even

00:36:35.336 --> 00:36:36.366 A:middle
because the user may not be

00:36:36.366 --> 00:36:37.546 A:middle
pointing at the same scene as

00:36:37.546 --> 00:36:37.906 A:middle
before.

00:36:38.756 --> 00:36:39.656 A:middle
So, how do we know when

00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:40.606 A:middle
localization happen?

00:36:41.686 --> 00:36:43.776 A:middle
That information is available in

00:36:43.776 --> 00:36:44.666 A:middle
the tracking state.

00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:45.896 A:middle
So, as soon as you start the

00:36:45.896 --> 00:36:47.596 A:middle
session with the initial World

00:36:47.596 --> 00:36:49.256 A:middle
map, the tracking state will be

00:36:49.256 --> 00:36:50.326 A:middle
limited with reason

00:36:50.536 --> 00:36:51.366 A:middle
Relocalizing.

00:36:51.906 --> 00:36:54.226 A:middle
Note that you will still get the

00:36:54.226 --> 00:36:55.816 A:middle
tracking data available here,

00:36:56.176 --> 00:36:58.726 A:middle
but the world origin will be the

00:36:58.726 --> 00:37:00.376 A:middle
first camera, just like a new
