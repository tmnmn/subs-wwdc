00:18:00.216 --> 00:18:03.636 A:middle
An ARCamera object, again,

00:18:03.636 --> 00:18:05.626 A:middle
contains the transform, which in

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.946 A:middle
this case of World Tracking

00:18:07.496 --> 00:18:08.806 A:middle
contains, additionally, to the

00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:11.016 A:middle
rotation, also, the translation

00:18:11.016 --> 00:18:12.116 A:middle
of the track camera.

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:15.106 A:middle
Additionally, the ARCamera also

00:18:15.106 --> 00:18:16.886 A:middle
contains information about the

00:18:16.886 --> 00:18:18.556 A:middle
tracking state and

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:19.746 A:middle
trackingStateReason.

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:22.366 A:middle
This will provide some

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:24.206 A:middle
information about the current

00:18:24.306 --> 00:18:25.216 A:middle
tracking quality.

00:18:26.736 --> 00:18:27.976 A:middle
So, tracking quality.

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:29.906 A:middle
Have you ever experienced

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:32.376 A:middle
opening an AR app and the

00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:34.476 A:middle
tracking worked very poorly or

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:35.646 A:middle
maybe it didn't work at all?

00:18:36.276 --> 00:18:37.346 A:middle
How did that feel?

00:18:38.446 --> 00:18:39.846 A:middle
Maybe frustrating?

00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:40.796 A:middle
You might not open the app,

00:18:40.796 --> 00:18:41.166 A:middle
again.

00:18:42.026 --> 00:18:43.566 A:middle
So, how can you get a higher

00:18:43.566 --> 00:18:45.326 A:middle
tracking quality for your app?

00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:48.626 A:middle
For this, we need to understand

00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:49.846 A:middle
the main factors that are

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:51.016 A:middle
influencing the tracking

00:18:51.016 --> 00:18:51.646 A:middle
quality.

00:18:52.156 --> 00:18:53.436 A:middle
And I want to highlight three of

00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:53.856 A:middle
them here.

00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:56.756 A:middle
First of all, World Tracking

00:18:56.756 --> 00:18:58.996 A:middle
relies on a constant stream of

00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:01.136 A:middle
camera images and sensor data.
