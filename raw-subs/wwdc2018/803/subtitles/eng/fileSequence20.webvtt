00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
your eyes work, and the way a

00:20:00.406 --> 00:20:01.086 A:middle
camera works.

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:03.316 A:middle
And you can also do-- take a

00:20:03.356 --> 00:20:05.396 A:middle
page from 2D animation and video

00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:07.026 A:middle
games by stretching, this-- this

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:07.786 A:middle
technique called motion

00:20:07.786 --> 00:20:09.536 A:middle
stretching stretches the content

00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:12.376 A:middle
in each frame to provide this

00:20:12.376 --> 00:20:14.876 A:middle
elastic look as it moves with

00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:15.466 A:middle
velocity.

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:19.246 A:middle
And so, in motion, it kind of

00:20:19.246 --> 00:20:20.086 A:middle
looks like this.

00:20:20.746 --> 00:20:22.126 A:middle
So, each of the different

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:23.866 A:middle
techniques, kind of, tries to

00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:26.556 A:middle
encode more information visually

00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:28.466 A:middle
about what's going on in the

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:28.896 A:middle
motion.

00:20:29.546 --> 00:20:30.386 A:middle
And, I want to focus a little

00:20:30.386 --> 00:20:31.286 A:middle
bit on this last one here,

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:32.906 A:middle
motion stretching, because we do

00:20:32.906 --> 00:20:34.206 A:middle
this on iPhone 10, actually.

00:20:34.876 --> 00:20:36.136 A:middle
You know, when you launch an

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:39.066 A:middle
app, the icon elastically

00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:40.606 A:middle
stretches down to become the app

00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:41.636 A:middle
as it opens.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.726 A:middle
And, it stretches up in the

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:45.096 A:middle
opposite direction as you close

00:20:45.096 --> 00:20:45.556 A:middle
the app.

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:46.876 A:middle
To give you that little bit

00:20:46.876 --> 00:20:48.486 A:middle
extra information between each

00:20:48.486 --> 00:20:49.786 A:middle
frame of motion to make it a

00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:53.366 A:middle
little bit smoother-looking.

00:20:53.366 --> 00:20:55.356 A:middle
Lastly, we want to work with

00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:57.546 A:middle
behavior rather than animation.

00:20:58.226 --> 00:20:59.226 A:middle
You know, things in the real

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.836 A:middle
world are always in a state of
