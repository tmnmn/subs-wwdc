00:55:00.586 --> 00:55:01.846 A:middle
So, not just the position, but

00:55:01.846 --> 00:55:03.996 A:middle
also the velocity, the pressure,

00:55:04.266 --> 00:55:07.886 A:middle
the size of the touch.

00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:10.106 A:middle
In most situations though, your

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:12.006 A:middle
interfaces must respond to more

00:55:12.006 --> 00:55:12.856 A:middle
than one gesture.

00:55:13.586 --> 00:55:14.836 A:middle
As you keep adding features to

00:55:14.836 --> 00:55:16.766 A:middle
your apps, the complexity and

00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:18.446 A:middle
number of gestures increases,

00:55:19.216 --> 00:55:19.296 A:middle
too.

00:55:19.836 --> 00:55:21.976 A:middle
For instance, almost all UIs

00:55:21.976 --> 00:55:23.476 A:middle
that use a scroll view will have

00:55:23.476 --> 00:55:25.196 A:middle
other gestures like taps and

00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:26.626 A:middle
swipes competing with each

00:55:26.626 --> 00:55:26.996 A:middle
other.

00:55:27.476 --> 00:55:29.116 A:middle
Like in this example, I can

00:55:29.116 --> 00:55:30.846 A:middle
scroll the list of Contacts, or

00:55:30.846 --> 00:55:32.306 A:middle
freely touch on one of them to

00:55:32.306 --> 00:55:33.486 A:middle
preview it.

00:55:34.996 --> 00:55:36.846 A:middle
So, if we had to wait for the

00:55:36.846 --> 00:55:39.006 A:middle
final gesture, before we show

00:55:39.006 --> 00:55:40.676 A:middle
any feedback, we would have to

00:55:40.676 --> 00:55:41.656 A:middle
introduce a delay.

00:55:42.276 --> 00:55:43.566 A:middle
And, during that wait, the

00:55:43.566 --> 00:55:44.566 A:middle
interface wouldn't feel

00:55:44.566 --> 00:55:45.236 A:middle
responsive.

00:55:45.726 --> 00:55:48.306 A:middle
For that reason, we should

00:55:48.306 --> 00:55:49.896 A:middle
detect all possible gestures

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:50.996 A:middle
from the beginning of the

00:55:50.996 --> 00:55:51.536 A:middle
action.

00:55:52.106 --> 00:55:53.456 A:middle
And, once we are confident of

00:55:53.456 --> 00:55:55.286 A:middle
the intention, cancel all the

00:55:55.286 --> 00:55:55.976 A:middle
other gestures.

00:55:58.556 --> 00:55:59.856 A:middle
So, if we go back to our

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.756 A:middle
example, I start pressing that
