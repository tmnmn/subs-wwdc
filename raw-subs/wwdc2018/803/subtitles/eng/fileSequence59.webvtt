00:58:58.716 --> 00:59:00.286 A:middle
distinguish it from the content.

00:59:01.586 --> 00:59:03.006 A:middle
So, a good example of this is

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.056 A:middle
our on/off switch.

00:59:04.496 --> 00:59:05.696 A:middle
We want to indicate that the

00:59:05.696 --> 00:59:07.136 A:middle
knob of the switch is grabbable,

00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:08.996 A:middle
so we elevate it to another

00:59:09.076 --> 00:59:09.396 A:middle
plane.

00:59:10.036 --> 00:59:11.656 A:middle
This helps visually separate it,

00:59:11.816 --> 00:59:13.316 A:middle
and indicate its draggable

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:13.776 A:middle
nature.

00:59:14.696 --> 00:59:16.096 A:middle
So, floating elements,

00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:17.716 A:middle
interactive elements like this,

00:59:17.716 --> 00:59:19.406 A:middle
above the interface can help

00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:20.816 A:middle
indicate that they're grabbable.

00:59:21.506 --> 00:59:26.136 A:middle
Next, we can use behavior, you

00:59:26.136 --> 00:59:28.156 A:middle
know, to show rather than tell

00:59:28.516 --> 00:59:29.656 A:middle
to use-- how to use an

00:59:29.656 --> 00:59:30.136 A:middle
interface.

00:59:30.426 --> 00:59:32.356 A:middle
So, we can reinforce a dynamic

00:59:32.396 --> 00:59:33.526 A:middle
behavior with a static

00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:34.106 A:middle
animation.

00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:35.976 A:middle
So, an example of this is

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:36.446 A:middle
Safari.

00:59:37.076 --> 00:59:39.166 A:middle
In Safari, we have this x icon

00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:40.456 A:middle
at the top left to close the

00:59:40.456 --> 00:59:41.816 A:middle
tab, and when you hit that

00:59:41.866 --> 00:59:43.646 A:middle
button, we slide the tab left to

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:44.766 A:middle
indicate it's deleted.

00:59:45.596 --> 00:59:46.846 A:middle
This hints to me that I can

00:59:46.846 --> 00:59:48.576 A:middle
slide it myself to the left.

00:59:48.676 --> 00:59:50.536 A:middle
And, accomplish the same action

00:59:50.536 --> 00:59:52.116 A:middle
of deleting the tab through a

00:59:52.116 --> 00:59:52.586 A:middle
gesture.

00:59:53.436 --> 00:59:54.886 A:middle
So, by keeping the discrete

00:59:55.046 --> 00:59:56.246 A:middle
animation and the gesture

00:59:56.246 --> 00:59:58.786 A:middle
aligned, we can use one to teach

00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.246 A:middle
the other.
