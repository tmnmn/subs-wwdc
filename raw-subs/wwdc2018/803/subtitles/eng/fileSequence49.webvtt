[ Applause ]

00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:06.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was great.

00:49:06.836 --> 00:49:07.906 A:middle
Thanks, Nathan.

00:49:13.446 --> 00:49:14.176 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:15.936 A:middle
My name is Marcos.

00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:18.816 A:middle
So far, we've seen how important

00:49:18.816 --> 00:49:20.266 A:middle
fluidity is when designing

00:49:20.266 --> 00:49:20.956 A:middle
interfaces.

00:49:21.786 --> 00:49:24.096 A:middle
And, a lot of that comes from

00:49:24.096 --> 00:49:25.366 A:middle
your interaction with a device.

00:49:26.776 --> 00:49:28.366 A:middle
So, in this section, we're going

00:49:28.366 --> 00:49:29.996 A:middle
to show you how touches on the

00:49:29.996 --> 00:49:32.136 A:middle
screen become gestures in your

00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:32.566 A:middle
apps.

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.316 A:middle
And, how to design these

00:49:34.366 --> 00:49:36.106 A:middle
gestures to capture all the

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:37.746 A:middle
expression and intent into your

00:49:37.746 --> 00:49:38.476 A:middle
interfaces.

00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:43.206 A:middle
So, we're going to start by

00:49:43.206 --> 00:49:44.656 A:middle
looking at the design of some

00:49:44.656 --> 00:49:46.366 A:middle
core gestures like taps and

00:49:46.366 --> 00:49:46.936 A:middle
swipes.

00:49:47.966 --> 00:49:48.956 A:middle
Then, we'll look at some

00:49:48.956 --> 00:49:50.586 A:middle
interaction principles, that you

00:49:50.586 --> 00:49:51.606 A:middle
should follow when designing

00:49:51.606 --> 00:49:52.956 A:middle
gestures for your interface.

00:49:54.176 --> 00:49:55.686 A:middle
And then, we'll see how to deal

00:49:55.686 --> 00:49:57.386 A:middle
with multiple gestures, and how

00:49:57.386 --> 00:49:59.376 A:middle
to combine them into your apps.
