00:26:58.426 --> 00:27:00.136 A:middle
Even when, actually, new dynamic

00:27:00.196 --> 00:27:01.626 A:middle
behaviors are being introduced

00:27:01.626 --> 00:27:02.816 A:middle
to the motion of the car, like a

00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:04.316 A:middle
brake, which is applying

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:06.866 A:middle
friction to the car.

00:27:08.346 --> 00:27:09.536 A:middle
And, even when the car comes to

00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:11.396 A:middle
a complete stop, you'll notice

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.266 A:middle
that the curve is completely

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:13.656 A:middle
smooth.

00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:15.016 A:middle
There's this indiscernible

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:16.126 A:middle
quality to it.

00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:17.436 A:middle
You can't tell when the car

00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:18.486 A:middle
precisely stopped.

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:21.936 A:middle
So, why am I talking about cars?

00:27:21.936 --> 00:27:23.806 A:middle
This is a talk about fluid

00:27:23.806 --> 00:27:24.666 A:middle
interfaces, right?

00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:28.056 A:middle
So, we feel like the

00:27:28.056 --> 00:27:29.596 A:middle
characteristics of the physical

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:31.556 A:middle
world make for great behaviors.

00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:34.256 A:middle
Everyone in this room finds the

00:27:34.326 --> 00:27:36.786 A:middle
car example so simple because we

00:27:36.786 --> 00:27:38.276 A:middle
have a shared understanding, or

00:27:38.276 --> 00:27:40.486 A:middle
a shared intuition for how an

00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:42.206 A:middle
object like a car moves through

00:27:42.206 --> 00:27:42.676 A:middle
the world.

00:27:43.966 --> 00:27:44.906 A:middle
And, this makes us a great

00:27:44.906 --> 00:27:47.086 A:middle
reference point.

00:27:47.276 --> 00:27:48.186 A:middle
Now, I don't mean that we need

00:27:48.186 --> 00:27:49.736 A:middle
to build perfect physical

00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:51.516 A:middle
simulations of cars that

00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:53.086 A:middle
literally drive our interface.

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:55.476 A:middle
But, we can draw on the motion

00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:57.406 A:middle
of a car, of objects that we

00:27:57.576 --> 00:27:58.896 A:middle
throw or move around in the

00:27:58.896 --> 00:28:01.636 A:middle
physical world around us and use
