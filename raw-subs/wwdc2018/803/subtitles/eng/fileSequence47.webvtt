00:46:58.546 --> 00:47:01.336 A:middle
And, it's this imaginary,

00:47:01.336 --> 00:47:03.196 A:middle
projected position that I then

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:04.676 A:middle
use as the nearest corner

00:47:04.676 --> 00:47:05.246 A:middle
position.

00:47:06.246 --> 00:47:07.616 A:middle
And, I send my PIP there, by

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:09.166 A:middle
retargeting it.

00:47:11.236 --> 00:47:13.406 A:middle
So, this idea of using

00:47:13.836 --> 00:47:17.156 A:middle
projection to find out the

00:47:17.216 --> 00:47:19.266 A:middle
endpoint of a position, is

00:47:19.416 --> 00:47:21.026 A:middle
incredibly useful for things

00:47:21.026 --> 00:47:22.366 A:middle
being dragged or swiped, where

00:47:22.366 --> 00:47:23.676 A:middle
you really need to respect the

00:47:23.676 --> 00:47:24.856 A:middle
momentum of the gesture.

00:47:26.396 --> 00:47:27.516 A:middle
But, this projection function

00:47:27.516 --> 00:47:29.706 A:middle
isn't just useful for positions,

00:47:29.706 --> 00:47:31.756 A:middle
you can also use it for scales,

00:47:32.636 --> 00:47:34.126 A:middle
or even for rotations.

00:47:35.026 --> 00:47:36.506 A:middle
Or, even combinations of the

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:36.876 A:middle
two.

00:47:37.866 --> 00:47:39.496 A:middle
It's a really versatile tool

00:47:39.496 --> 00:47:40.696 A:middle
that you should really be using

00:47:40.696 --> 00:47:41.796 A:middle
to make sure that you're

00:47:41.836 --> 00:47:43.866 A:middle
respecting the momentum of a

00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:45.856 A:middle
gesture, and making it feel like

00:47:46.036 --> 00:47:47.326 A:middle
the dynamic motion in your app

00:47:47.766 --> 00:47:49.186 A:middle
is an extension of yourself.

00:47:51.086 --> 00:47:53.776 A:middle
So, that's designing with

00:47:53.906 --> 00:47:54.496 A:middle
motion.

00:47:54.976 --> 00:47:55.936 A:middle
Dynamic motion.

00:47:56.896 --> 00:47:58.916 A:middle
Behaviors should continuously

00:47:58.916 --> 00:48:00.986 A:middle
and seamlessly work in concert
