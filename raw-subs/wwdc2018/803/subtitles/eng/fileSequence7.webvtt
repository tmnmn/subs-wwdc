00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:02.756 A:middle
Next, we want to allow for

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.216 A:middle
constant redirection and

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:04.896 A:middle
interruption.

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:05.866 A:middle
This one's big.

00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:08.526 A:middle
So, our bodies and minds are

00:07:08.756 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
constantly in a state of

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.496 A:middle
redirecting in response to

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:12.206 A:middle
change in thought, like we

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:12.736 A:middle
talked about.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:14.916 A:middle
So, if I was walking to the end

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:16.496 A:middle
of this stage here, and I

00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:17.736 A:middle
realize I forgot something back

00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:19.166 A:middle
there, I could just turn back

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:19.706 A:middle
immediately.

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:20.656 A:middle
And, I wouldn't have to wait for

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:22.676 A:middle
my body to reach the end before

00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:23.936 A:middle
I did that, right?

00:07:24.336 --> 00:07:25.376 A:middle
So, it's important for our

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:26.896 A:middle
interfaces to be able to reflect

00:07:26.986 --> 00:07:28.666 A:middle
that ability of constantly

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:29.246 A:middle
redirecting.

00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:31.086 A:middle
And, it makes it feel connected

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:31.486 A:middle
to you.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.286 A:middle
That's why for iPhone 10, we

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.936 A:middle
built a fully redirectable

00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:36.416 A:middle
interface.

00:07:37.336 --> 00:07:38.546 A:middle
So, what's that?

00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:41.206 A:middle
So, the iPhone 10's an

00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:42.586 A:middle
actually-- it's pretty simple

00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:43.416 A:middle
two-axis gesture.

00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:44.676 A:middle
You go horizontally between

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:44.836 A:middle
apps.

00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:46.366 A:middle
And, you go vertically to go

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:46.646 A:middle
home.

00:07:47.106 --> 00:07:48.586 A:middle
But you can also mix the two

00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:50.136 A:middle
axes, so you can be on your way

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:52.036 A:middle
home, and peek at multitasking

00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:53.156 A:middle
and decide whether or not to go

00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:53.336 A:middle
there.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:55.306 A:middle
Or, you can go to multitasking

00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:57.046 A:middle
and decide, actually, no, I want

00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:57.426 A:middle
to go home.

00:07:58.286 --> 00:07:59.926 A:middle
So, this might not seem that

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.596 A:middle
important, but what if we didn't
