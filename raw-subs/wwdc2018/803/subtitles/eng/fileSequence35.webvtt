00:35:00.446 --> 00:35:02.506 A:middle
We actually like to avoid using

00:35:02.506 --> 00:35:03.986 A:middle
duration when we're describing

00:35:03.986 --> 00:35:05.456 A:middle
elastic behaviors, because it

00:35:05.456 --> 00:35:07.356 A:middle
reinforces this concept of

00:35:07.726 --> 00:35:09.506 A:middle
constant dynamic change.

00:35:09.756 --> 00:35:11.656 A:middle
The spring is always moving, and

00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:12.866 A:middle
it's ready to move somewhere

00:35:12.866 --> 00:35:13.066 A:middle
else.

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:15.466 A:middle
Now, the technical terms for

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:17.016 A:middle
these two properties are damping

00:35:17.016 --> 00:35:18.836 A:middle
ratio and frequency response.

00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:20.426 A:middle
So, if you'd like to use these

00:35:20.426 --> 00:35:21.666 A:middle
for your own design work, you

00:35:21.666 --> 00:35:23.396 A:middle
can look up those terms, and

00:35:23.456 --> 00:35:25.866 A:middle
you'll find easy ways to convert

00:35:27.436 --> 00:35:27.546 A:middle
them.

00:35:27.776 --> 00:35:29.836 A:middle
So, we now have these two simple

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:31.116 A:middle
properties for controlling

00:35:31.116 --> 00:35:32.086 A:middle
elastic behaviors.

00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:35.166 A:middle
But, there's still an infinite

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.666 A:middle
number of possibilities that we

00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:38.106 A:middle
can have with these curves.

00:35:38.106 --> 00:35:39.836 A:middle
Like, there's just hundreds,

00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:41.176 A:middle
thousands, millions of different

00:35:41.176 --> 00:35:42.756 A:middle
ways we can configure those two

00:35:42.756 --> 00:35:44.916 A:middle
simple properties and get very

00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:45.826 A:middle
different behavior.

00:35:47.106 --> 00:35:49.636 A:middle
How do we use these to craft a

00:35:49.636 --> 00:35:50.786 A:middle
character in our app?

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:53.996 A:middle
To control the feel of our app?

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
Well, first and foremost, we

00:35:56.286 --> 00:35:57.516 A:middle
need to remember that our

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:59.246 A:middle
devices are tools.
