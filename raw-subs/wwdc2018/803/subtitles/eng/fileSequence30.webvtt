00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
them all, but I'd like to focus

00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:02.346 A:middle
on this next one, because we

00:30:02.346 --> 00:30:04.276 A:middle
personally find it incredibly

00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:05.886 A:middle
indispensable in our own design

00:30:05.886 --> 00:30:05.976 A:middle
work.

00:30:08.076 --> 00:30:10.116 A:middle
So, materials like this

00:30:10.826 --> 00:30:12.626 A:middle
beautiful flower here, the

00:30:12.626 --> 00:30:14.386 A:middle
natural fibers of this flower

00:30:15.136 --> 00:30:17.106 A:middle
have this organic characteristic

00:30:17.186 --> 00:30:18.546 A:middle
called elasticity.

00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:21.926 A:middle
And, elasticity is this tendency

00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:23.776 A:middle
for a material to gracefully

00:30:23.776 --> 00:30:26.526 A:middle
return into a resting state once

00:30:26.526 --> 00:30:28.036 A:middle
stress or strain is removed.

00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:31.766 A:middle
Our own bodies are incredibly

00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:32.286 A:middle
elastic.

00:30:33.216 --> 00:30:34.746 A:middle
Now, we're capable of running

00:30:35.196 --> 00:30:37.626 A:middle
incredibly long distances, not

00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:38.956 A:middle
because of the strength of our

00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:40.646 A:middle
muscles, but because of their

00:30:40.646 --> 00:30:41.786 A:middle
ability to relax.

00:30:43.296 --> 00:30:44.596 A:middle
It's their elasticity that's

00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:45.156 A:middle
doing this.

00:30:46.296 --> 00:30:47.726 A:middle
So, our muscles contract and

00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:49.256 A:middle
relax once stress and strain is

00:30:49.256 --> 00:30:49.786 A:middle
removed.

00:30:49.896 --> 00:30:51.116 A:middle
And, this is how we conserve

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:51.556 A:middle
energy.

00:30:51.776 --> 00:30:53.856 A:middle
Makes us feel natural and

00:30:54.576 --> 00:30:54.806 A:middle
organic.

00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:58.476 A:middle
The same elasticity is used in

00:30:58.686 --> 00:30:59.206 A:middle
iPhone 10.
