00:45:01.026 --> 00:45:02.896 A:middle
And, basically by taking

00:45:02.896 --> 00:45:05.066 A:middle
advantage of that here, we're

00:45:05.146 --> 00:45:06.906 A:middle
reinforcing things that people

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:07.876 A:middle
have learned elsewhere.

00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:10.786 A:middle
That the behavior is just doing

00:45:10.786 --> 00:45:15.426 A:middle
what was expected of the system.

00:45:15.566 --> 00:45:17.756 A:middle
Now this new, hypothetical,

00:45:18.126 --> 00:45:21.296 A:middle
imaginary PIP position is not

00:45:21.296 --> 00:45:21.566 A:middle
real.

00:45:21.566 --> 00:45:22.756 A:middle
We're not going to show the PIP

00:45:22.756 --> 00:45:24.056 A:middle
go here in the interface.

00:45:24.266 --> 00:45:25.196 A:middle
This is what we call a

00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:25.826 A:middle
projection.

00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:28.656 A:middle
So, we've taken the velocity of

00:45:28.656 --> 00:45:30.526 A:middle
the PIP, when it was thrown.

00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:32.066 A:middle
We've, kind of, mixed in the

00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:34.336 A:middle
deceleration rate, and we end up

00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:35.926 A:middle
with this projected position

00:45:36.196 --> 00:45:38.586 A:middle
where it could go if we scrolled

00:45:39.416 --> 00:45:40.936 A:middle
it there.

00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:42.666 A:middle
And so, now instead of finding

00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:44.346 A:middle
the nearest endpoint to the PIP

00:45:45.056 --> 00:45:47.096 A:middle
when we throw, we can calculate

00:45:47.096 --> 00:45:49.466 A:middle
its projected position and move

00:45:49.466 --> 00:45:50.946 A:middle
there instead.

00:45:51.476 --> 00:45:53.346 A:middle
So now, when I swipe from one

00:45:53.346 --> 00:45:55.036 A:middle
corner of the screen to another

00:45:55.036 --> 00:45:56.216 A:middle
with just a lightweight flick,

00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:58.216 A:middle
it goes to the endpoint that I

00:45:58.216 --> 00:45:58.956 A:middle
expected.
