01:03:58.996 --> 01:04:01.246 A:middle
When we align the interface to

01:04:01.246 --> 01:04:02.586 A:middle
the way we think and move,

01:04:03.376 --> 01:04:04.756 A:middle
something kind of magical

01:04:04.756 --> 01:04:05.166 A:middle
happens.

01:04:05.986 --> 01:04:07.796 A:middle
It really stops feeling like a

01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:09.906 A:middle
computer, and starts feeling

01:04:09.906 --> 01:04:11.596 A:middle
like a seamless extension of us.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.206 A:middle
You know, as we design the

01:04:16.276 --> 01:04:18.336 A:middle
future of interfaces, we think

01:04:18.336 --> 01:04:19.776 A:middle
it's really important to try and

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.716 A:middle
capture our humanity in the

01:04:21.716 --> 01:04:22.626 A:middle
technology like this.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:24.416 A:middle
So, that one of the most

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:26.596 A:middle
important tools of humankind is

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.966 A:middle
not a burden, but a pleasure and

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:30.086 A:middle
a delight to use.

01:04:30.966 --> 01:04:31.956 A:middle
Thank you very much.
