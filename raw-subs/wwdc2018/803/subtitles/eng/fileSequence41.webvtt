into other behaviors.

00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:07.396 A:middle
So, next up, I'd like to talk a

00:41:07.396 --> 00:41:10.156 A:middle
little bit about aligning

00:41:10.186 --> 00:41:12.466 A:middle
motion, or dynamic motion, with

00:41:12.506 --> 00:41:12.976 A:middle
intent.

00:41:17.216 --> 00:41:19.146 A:middle
So, for a discrete interaction

00:41:19.146 --> 00:41:21.906 A:middle
like a button, it's pretty clear

00:41:21.906 --> 00:41:23.406 A:middle
what the intent of the gesture

00:41:23.406 --> 00:41:23.756 A:middle
is.

00:41:23.966 --> 00:41:26.086 A:middle
Right? You've got three distinct

00:41:26.226 --> 00:41:28.036 A:middle
visual representations on screen

00:41:28.036 --> 00:41:28.276 A:middle
here.

00:41:29.226 --> 00:41:31.256 A:middle
And, when I tap one of them, the

00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:32.196 A:middle
outcome is clear.

00:41:33.856 --> 00:41:35.096 A:middle
But, with a gesture like a

00:41:35.216 --> 00:41:37.796 A:middle
swipe, the intent is less

00:41:37.866 --> 00:41:39.246 A:middle
immediately clear.

00:41:39.686 --> 00:41:41.456 A:middle
You could say that the intent is

00:41:41.456 --> 00:41:43.126 A:middle
almost encoded in the motion of

00:41:43.126 --> 00:41:45.176 A:middle
the gesture, and so it's our

00:41:45.176 --> 00:41:47.736 A:middle
job, our role, to interpret what

00:41:47.736 --> 00:41:50.006 A:middle
the motion means to decide what

00:41:50.226 --> 00:41:51.786 A:middle
we should do with it.

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.696 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:41:55.086 --> 00:41:56.546 A:middle
So, let's say I made a FaceTime

00:41:56.546 --> 00:41:58.046 A:middle
call, a one-on-one FaceTime

00:41:58.046 --> 00:42:01.216 A:middle
call, and in FaceTime, we have a
