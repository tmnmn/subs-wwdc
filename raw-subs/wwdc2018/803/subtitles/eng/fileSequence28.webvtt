00:27:58.896 --> 00:28:01.636 A:middle
physical world around us and use

00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.676 A:middle
them in our own dynamic

00:28:02.726 --> 00:28:04.986 A:middle
behaviors to make their motion

00:28:04.986 --> 00:28:07.466 A:middle
feel familiar, or relatable, or

00:28:07.466 --> 00:28:09.086 A:middle
even believable, which is the

00:28:09.086 --> 00:28:11.756 A:middle
most important thing.

00:28:11.986 --> 00:28:13.666 A:middle
Now, this idea of referencing

00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:15.646 A:middle
the physical world in dynamic

00:28:15.696 --> 00:28:17.906 A:middle
behaviors has been in the iPhone

00:28:17.906 --> 00:28:19.046 A:middle
since the very beginning with

00:28:19.236 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
scrolling.

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:22.766 A:middle
A child can pick up an iPhone

00:28:22.766 --> 00:28:24.156 A:middle
and scroll to their favorite app

00:28:24.156 --> 00:28:25.936 A:middle
on the Home screen, just as

00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:27.376 A:middle
easily as they can push a toy

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:30.666 A:middle
car across the floor.

00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:32.716 A:middle
So, what are some key, kind of,

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:34.556 A:middle
characteristics of this

00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:36.116 A:middle
scrolling, dynamic behavior that

00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:36.606 A:middle
we have?

00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:39.376 A:middle
Well, firstly it's tapping into

00:28:39.376 --> 00:28:41.236 A:middle
that intuition, that shared

00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:42.756 A:middle
understanding that we all have

00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:45.276 A:middle
for objects moving around in the

00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:45.706 A:middle
world.

00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:47.256 A:middle
And, our influence on those

00:28:47.256 --> 00:28:47.866 A:middle
objects.

00:28:49.296 --> 00:28:51.366 A:middle
The motion of the content is

00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:53.786 A:middle
perfectly seamless, so while I'm

00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:55.086 A:middle
interacting with it, while I'm

00:28:55.086 --> 00:28:57.306 A:middle
dragging the content around, my

00:28:57.396 --> 00:28:59.096 A:middle
body is providing the fluidity

00:28:59.096 --> 00:29:00.776 A:middle
of the movement, because my body
