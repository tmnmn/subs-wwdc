00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.246 A:middle
the other.

01:00:02.296 --> 01:00:03.196 A:middle
And, there's another technique

01:00:03.196 --> 01:00:04.166 A:middle
we can use, which is

01:00:04.566 --> 01:00:05.306 A:middle
explanations.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:07.196 A:middle
This is when you explicitly tell

01:00:07.196 --> 01:00:08.576 A:middle
users how to use a gesture.

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:10.796 A:middle
So, this is best when used

01:00:10.796 --> 01:00:12.456 A:middle
sparingly, but it's best when

01:00:12.456 --> 01:00:14.196 A:middle
you have one gesture that's used

01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:15.766 A:middle
repeatedly in a bunch of places,

01:00:16.186 --> 01:00:18.216 A:middle
and you explain it once up

01:00:18.216 --> 01:00:19.246 A:middle
front, and then you just keep

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:20.966 A:middle
using it, and keep reinforcing

01:00:20.966 --> 01:00:21.036 A:middle
it.

01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:23.136 A:middle
Don't use it for a gesture

01:00:23.136 --> 01:00:24.836 A:middle
that's used only intermittently.

01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:25.976 A:middle
People won't remember that.

01:00:26.946 --> 01:00:29.706 A:middle
Now, I want to talk a little bit

01:00:29.706 --> 01:00:31.786 A:middle
about fun and playfulness.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:33.606 A:middle
Because this is one of the most

01:00:33.606 --> 01:00:35.346 A:middle
important aspects of a fluid

01:00:35.346 --> 01:00:35.976 A:middle
interface.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.906 A:middle
And, it only happens when you

01:00:37.906 --> 01:00:39.076 A:middle
nail everything.

01:00:40.326 --> 01:00:42.196 A:middle
It's a natural consequence of a

01:00:42.196 --> 01:00:43.136 A:middle
fluid interface.

01:00:43.136 --> 01:00:44.056 A:middle
It's when the interface is

01:00:44.056 --> 01:00:45.656 A:middle
responding instantly and

01:00:45.656 --> 01:00:46.186 A:middle
satisfyingly.

01:00:46.506 --> 01:00:47.686 A:middle
When it's redirectable and

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.216 A:middle
forgiving.

01:00:48.676 --> 01:00:49.956 A:middle
When the motion and gestures are

01:00:49.956 --> 01:00:50.496 A:middle
smooth.

01:00:50.496 --> 01:00:51.556 A:middle
And, everything we just talked

01:00:51.556 --> 01:00:51.816 A:middle
about.

01:00:52.426 --> 01:00:53.836 A:middle
The interface starts to feel in

01:00:53.976 --> 01:00:54.546 A:middle
sync with you.

01:00:55.336 --> 01:00:57.486 A:middle
And, something magical happens

01:00:57.486 --> 01:00:58.996 A:middle
where you don't feel like you

01:00:58.996 --> 01:01:00.446 A:middle
need to learn the interface, you
