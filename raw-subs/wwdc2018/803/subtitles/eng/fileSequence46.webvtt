00:46:03.176 --> 00:46:05.306 A:middle
So, this idea of projecting

00:46:05.306 --> 00:46:08.346 A:middle
momentum is incredibly useful.

00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:10.406 A:middle
And, we think its super

00:46:10.406 --> 00:46:10.806 A:middle
important.

00:46:10.806 --> 00:46:12.136 A:middle
I'd like to share some code for

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.536 A:middle
doing this with you, so that you

00:46:13.536 --> 00:46:16.196 A:middle
can do this in your own apps.

00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:17.596 A:middle
So, this function will take a

00:46:17.596 --> 00:46:19.366 A:middle
velocity like the PIP's position

00:46:19.366 --> 00:46:22.086 A:middle
velocity, and deceleration rate,

00:46:22.956 --> 00:46:24.966 A:middle
and it'll give you the value

00:46:24.996 --> 00:46:26.086 A:middle
that you could use as an

00:46:26.336 --> 00:46:28.206 A:middle
endpoint for dynamic behavior.

00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:29.876 A:middle
It's pretty simple.

00:46:30.556 --> 00:46:33.056 A:middle
If we look at my FaceTime

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:35.606 A:middle
example of the pan gesture

00:46:35.606 --> 00:46:38.556 A:middle
ending code, you can see that

00:46:38.556 --> 00:46:39.186 A:middle
I'm just using the

00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:41.326 A:middle
UIScrollView.DecelerationRate.

00:46:41.506 --> 00:46:43.106 A:middle
So, we're leaning on that

00:46:43.106 --> 00:46:44.556 A:middle
familiarity people have with

00:46:44.556 --> 00:46:46.186 A:middle
scrolling and how far content

00:46:46.186 --> 00:46:47.106 A:middle
will go when scrolled.

00:46:48.256 --> 00:46:50.966 A:middle
And, I'm using that with my

00:46:51.176 --> 00:46:51.846 A:middle
projection.

00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:53.536 A:middle
So, I take the velocity of the

00:46:53.606 --> 00:46:55.546 A:middle
PIP and the deceleration rate,

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:57.376 A:middle
and I create that imaginary PIP

00:46:57.416 --> 00:46:57.976 A:middle
position.

00:46:58.546 --> 00:47:01.336 A:middle
And, it's this imaginary,
