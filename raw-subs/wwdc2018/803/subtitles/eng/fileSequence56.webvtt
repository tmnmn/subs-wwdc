00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.756 A:middle
example, I start pressing that

00:56:01.756 --> 00:56:03.646 A:middle
contact, but I decide to scroll

00:56:03.646 --> 00:56:04.166 A:middle
instead.

00:56:04.836 --> 00:56:06.426 A:middle
And, it's at that moment that we

00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:08.336 A:middle
cancel the 3D touch action, and

00:56:08.336 --> 00:56:09.436 A:middle
transition into the right

00:56:09.516 --> 00:56:09.956 A:middle
gesture.

00:56:14.116 --> 00:56:15.506 A:middle
Sometimes, though, it's

00:56:15.506 --> 00:56:17.006 A:middle
inevitable to introduce delay.

00:56:17.816 --> 00:56:19.496 A:middle
For instance, every time we use

00:56:19.496 --> 00:56:21.306 A:middle
the double-tap in our UIs, all

00:56:21.306 --> 00:56:22.716 A:middle
normal taps will be delayed.

00:56:23.596 --> 00:56:25.446 A:middle
The system has to wait after the

00:56:25.446 --> 00:56:27.366 A:middle
tap, to see if it's a tap or a

00:56:27.366 --> 00:56:27.936 A:middle
double-tap.

00:56:28.476 --> 00:56:32.146 A:middle
In this example, since I can

00:56:32.146 --> 00:56:33.576 A:middle
double-tap to zoom in and out of

00:56:33.726 --> 00:56:36.336 A:middle
a photo, tapping to show the app

00:56:36.336 --> 00:56:38.176 A:middle
menu is delayed by about half a

00:56:38.176 --> 00:56:38.766 A:middle
second.

00:56:39.826 --> 00:56:41.056 A:middle
So, when designing gestures for

00:56:41.056 --> 00:56:42.676 A:middle
your applications, you should be

00:56:42.676 --> 00:56:44.256 A:middle
aware of these situations, and

00:56:44.256 --> 00:56:45.516 A:middle
try to avoid delays whenever

00:56:45.516 --> 00:56:46.046 A:middle
possible.

00:56:49.216 --> 00:56:51.406 A:middle
So, to summarize, we've seen how

00:56:51.406 --> 00:56:53.506 A:middle
to design some core gestures,

00:56:53.616 --> 00:56:54.826 A:middle
like taps and swipes.

00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:56.636 A:middle
We've seen that content and

00:56:56.636 --> 00:57:00.326 A:middle
touch should move one-to-one,
