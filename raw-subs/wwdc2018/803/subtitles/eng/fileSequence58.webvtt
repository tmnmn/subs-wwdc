00:57:59.376 --> 00:58:00.476 A:middle
along with us in a way that's

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.336 A:middle
friendly and inviting.

00:58:02.716 --> 00:58:04.196 A:middle
And so, one way we can do that

00:58:04.196 --> 00:58:05.606 A:middle
is with visual cues.

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.136 A:middle
So, the world is filled with

00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:08.936 A:middle
these things, right?

00:58:09.726 --> 00:58:10.996 A:middle
You can learn them once, and you

00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:12.116 A:middle
can use them everywhere.

00:58:12.116 --> 00:58:12.986 A:middle
They're portable.

00:58:12.986 --> 00:58:15.226 A:middle
And so, when you see this, you

00:58:15.226 --> 00:58:16.046 A:middle
know how to use it.

00:58:17.686 --> 00:58:19.156 A:middle
So, we've tried to establish

00:58:19.156 --> 00:58:20.766 A:middle
similar conventions in iOS.

00:58:21.106 --> 00:58:22.146 A:middle
Here's a couple examples.

00:58:23.196 --> 00:58:24.396 A:middle
So, if you have a scrolling list

00:58:24.396 --> 00:58:25.726 A:middle
of content, you can clip the

00:58:25.726 --> 00:58:27.566 A:middle
content off the bottom there, to

00:58:27.566 --> 00:58:28.786 A:middle
indicate that there's more to

00:58:28.836 --> 00:58:30.596 A:middle
see, that invites me to try and

00:58:30.596 --> 00:58:31.666 A:middle
reveal what's under there.

00:58:31.706 --> 00:58:34.036 A:middle
And, if we're dealing with pages

00:58:34.036 --> 00:58:36.106 A:middle
of content, you can use a paging

00:58:36.106 --> 00:58:37.916 A:middle
indicator to indicate that

00:58:37.916 --> 00:58:39.226 A:middle
there's multiple pages of

00:58:39.226 --> 00:58:39.576 A:middle
content.

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.676 A:middle
And, for sliding panes of

00:58:41.676 --> 00:58:42.636 A:middle
content, you can use an

00:58:42.636 --> 00:58:44.166 A:middle
affordance, or a grabber handle

00:58:44.166 --> 00:58:46.646 A:middle
like this, to indicate that it's

00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:47.776 A:middle
grabbable and slidable.

00:58:49.326 --> 00:58:50.926 A:middle
Another technique you can use is

00:58:50.926 --> 00:58:53.146 A:middle
to elevate interactive elements

00:58:53.146 --> 00:58:54.136 A:middle
to a separate plane.

00:58:54.566 --> 00:58:55.946 A:middle
So, if you have an interactive

00:58:55.946 --> 00:58:57.576 A:middle
element, lifting it up to a

00:58:57.626 --> 00:58:58.676 A:middle
separate plane can help

00:58:58.716 --> 00:59:00.286 A:middle
distinguish it from the content.
