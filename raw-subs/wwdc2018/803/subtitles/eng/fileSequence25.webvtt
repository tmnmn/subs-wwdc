00:24:58.236 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
First of all, we're going to

00:25:00.816 --> 00:25:02.756 A:middle
talk about seamless motion.

00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:06.226 A:middle
And, it's this element of motion

00:25:06.226 --> 00:25:07.486 A:middle
that makes it feel like the

00:25:07.486 --> 00:25:09.056 A:middle
dynamic motion is an extension

00:25:09.056 --> 00:25:09.656 A:middle
of yourself.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:11.896 A:middle
Then, we're going to take a look

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:12.386 A:middle
at character.

00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:14.806 A:middle
How, even without timing curves,

00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:16.196 A:middle
and timed animations, we can

00:25:16.196 --> 00:25:17.726 A:middle
introduce the concept of

00:25:17.876 --> 00:25:19.836 A:middle
playfulness, or character, or

00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:22.566 A:middle
texture to motion in your

00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:23.206 A:middle
interfaces.

00:25:24.696 --> 00:25:26.196 A:middle
And finally, we'll look at how

00:25:26.196 --> 00:25:27.816 A:middle
motion itself gives us some

00:25:27.906 --> 00:25:29.916 A:middle
clues about what people intend

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:32.126 A:middle
to do with your interface.

00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:33.456 A:middle
How we can resolve some

00:25:33.456 --> 00:25:35.176 A:middle
uncertainty about what a gesture

00:25:35.176 --> 00:25:36.796 A:middle
is trying to do by really

00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:38.816 A:middle
looking at the motion of the

00:25:38.816 --> 00:25:39.206 A:middle
gesture.

00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:44.206 A:middle
So, to kick things off, let's

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:45.516 A:middle
look at seamless motion.

00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:47.076 A:middle
What do I mean by seamless

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:47.466 A:middle
motion?

00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:49.866 A:middle
So, let's look at an example

00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:51.116 A:middle
that I think we can all

00:25:51.936 --> 00:25:53.496 A:middle
familiarize with.

00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:56.086 A:middle
So, here we have a car, and it's

00:25:56.266 --> 00:25:57.686 A:middle
cruising along at a constant

00:25:57.686 --> 00:25:58.086 A:middle
speed.

00:25:58.776 --> 00:25:59.636 A:middle
And then, the brakes are

00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
applied, slowing it down to a
