00:28:59.096 --> 00:29:00.776 A:middle
of the movement, because my body

00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:01.386 A:middle
is fluid.

00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:03.766 A:middle
But, as soon as I let go of the

00:29:03.766 --> 00:29:06.926 A:middle
content, it seamlessly coasts to

00:29:06.926 --> 00:29:07.716 A:middle
a stop.

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.346 A:middle
So, we're kind of maintaining

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:11.146 A:middle
the momentum of the effort being

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:12.896 A:middle
put into the interface.

00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:15.896 A:middle
The amount of friction that's

00:29:15.956 --> 00:29:17.966 A:middle
being used for scrolling is

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:19.806 A:middle
consistent, which makes it

00:29:19.876 --> 00:29:21.576 A:middle
predictable, and very easy to

00:29:21.606 --> 00:29:22.026 A:middle
master.

00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:25.956 A:middle
And finally, the content comes

00:29:25.986 --> 00:29:28.096 A:middle
to an imperceptible stop, kind

00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:29.246 A:middle
of like the car, not really

00:29:29.246 --> 00:29:31.186 A:middle
knowing precisely when it came

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:31.696 A:middle
to a stop.

00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:34.016 A:middle
And, we feel that this distinct

00:29:34.516 --> 00:29:36.366 A:middle
lack of an ending kind of

00:29:36.366 --> 00:29:38.446 A:middle
reinforces this idea that the

00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:39.966 A:middle
content is always moving, and

00:29:39.966 --> 00:29:42.066 A:middle
always able to move, so while

00:29:42.066 --> 00:29:43.226 A:middle
content is scrolling, it makes

00:29:43.276 --> 00:29:44.866 A:middle
it feel like you can just put

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:46.366 A:middle
your finger down again, and

00:29:46.466 --> 00:29:47.346 A:middle
continue scrolling.

00:29:47.346 --> 00:29:48.226 A:middle
You don't have to wait for

00:29:48.226 --> 00:29:49.166 A:middle
anything to finish.

00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:53.186 A:middle
So, there are innumerable

00:29:53.186 --> 00:29:55.116 A:middle
characteristics of the physical

00:29:55.116 --> 00:29:56.756 A:middle
world that would make for great

00:29:56.756 --> 00:29:57.406 A:middle
behaviors.

00:29:58.136 --> 00:29:59.296 A:middle
We don't have time to talk about

00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
them all, but I'd like to focus
