00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
app, and if I'm in a hurry, I

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.256 A:middle
can start interacting with the

00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
app as it's launching.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.366 A:middle
So, this stuff might not seem

00:10:05.366 --> 00:10:06.766 A:middle
really important, but we've

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:08.256 A:middle
found it's super important for

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:09.786 A:middle
the interface to be always

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:11.426 A:middle
responding, always understanding

00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:11.576 A:middle
you.

00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:13.566 A:middle
It always feels alive.

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:16.306 A:middle
And, that's really important for

00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:17.416 A:middle
your expectation and

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.776 A:middle
understanding of the interface,

00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:20.396 A:middle
to be comfortable with it.

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:21.736 A:middle
To realize that it's always

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:22.766 A:middle
going to respond to you when you

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:23.436 A:middle
need it.

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:27.776 A:middle
And, that applies as well to

00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:29.476 A:middle
changes in motion, not just to

00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:31.496 A:middle
the start of an interaction, but

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:32.796 A:middle
when you're in the middle of an

00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:33.526 A:middle
interaction, and you're

00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:34.106 A:middle
changing.

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:35.726 A:middle
It's important for us to be

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:37.196 A:middle
responsive to interruption as

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:37.486 A:middle
well.

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:39.236 A:middle
So, a good example is

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:40.606 A:middle
multitasking on iPhone 10.

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.936 A:middle
So, we have this pause gesture

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:44.136 A:middle
where you slide your finger up

00:10:44.136 --> 00:10:45.506 A:middle
halfway up the screen, and

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:47.726 A:middle
pause, and so we need to figure

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:50.506 A:middle
out how to detect this change in

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:50.896 A:middle
motion.

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:52.166 A:middle
And so, how do we do this?

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:53.216 A:middle
How do we detect this change in

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:53.576 A:middle
motion?

00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:55.036 A:middle
Should we use a timer?

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:56.586 A:middle
Should we wait until your finger

00:10:56.586 --> 00:10:57.756 A:middle
has come below a certain

00:10:57.756 --> 00:10:59.486 A:middle
velocity for a few amount of

00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
time, and then [inaudible] bring
