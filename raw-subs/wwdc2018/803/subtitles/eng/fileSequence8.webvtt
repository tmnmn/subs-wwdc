00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.596 A:middle
important, but what if we didn't

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:01.916 A:middle
do this?

00:08:02.026 --> 00:08:03.266 A:middle
What if it wasn't redirectable?

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
So, what if the only gestures

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:09.246 A:middle
you could do was this horizontal

00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:11.226 A:middle
gesture between apps, and then a

00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:12.666 A:middle
vertical gesture to go home, and

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:13.256 A:middle
that's it.

00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
You couldn't do any of that

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:15.416 A:middle
in-between stuff I just

00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:15.776 A:middle
mentioned.

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:17.846 A:middle
Well, what would happen is that

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:19.406 A:middle
you would have to think before

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:21.136 A:middle
what you did, before you

00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:21.876 A:middle
performed the gesture, you'd

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.086 A:middle
have to think what you want to

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:23.153 A:middle
do.

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:25.156 A:middle
And so, the series of events

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:26.276 A:middle
would be very linear, right?

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.276 A:middle
So, you'd have to think, do I

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:28.106 A:middle
want to go home?

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.396 A:middle
Do I want to go to multitasking?

00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:30.876 A:middle
Then you make your decision,

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:32.306 A:middle
then you perform the gesture,

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:32.905 A:middle
and then you release.

00:08:34.206 --> 00:08:35.876 A:middle
But, the cool thing is when it's

00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:37.876 A:middle
redirectable, the thought and

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:39.746 A:middle
gesture happen in parallel.

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.535 A:middle
And, you sort of think it with

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.756 A:middle
the gesture, and it turns out

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:46.776 A:middle
this is way faster than thinking

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:47.386 A:middle
before doing.

00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:48.826 A:middle
You know? Because it's a

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:52.326 A:middle
multi-axis gestural space.

00:08:52.326 --> 00:08:53.676 A:middle
It's not separate gestures.

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.616 A:middle
It's one gesture that does all

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:55.976 A:middle
this stuff.

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:57.306 A:middle
Home, multitasking, quick app

00:08:57.306 --> 00:08:58.266 A:middle
switching, so you don't have to

00:08:58.646 --> 00:08:59.766 A:middle
think about it as a separate

00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
gesture.
