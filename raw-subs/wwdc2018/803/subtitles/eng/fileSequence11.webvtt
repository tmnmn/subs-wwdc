00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
time, and then [inaudible] bring

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.886 A:middle
in the multitasking cards?

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:04.236 A:middle
Well, it turns out that's too

00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:04.976 A:middle
slow.

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:06.636 A:middle
People expect to be able to get

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.086 A:middle
to multitasking instantly.

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:10.856 A:middle
And, we need a way that can

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:13.986 A:middle
respond as fast as them.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.116 A:middle
So, instead we look at your

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:16.376 A:middle
finger's acceleration.

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:18.636 A:middle
It turns out there's a huge

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.336 A:middle
spike in the acceleration of

00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:21.416 A:middle
your finger when you pause.

00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:23.056 A:middle
And, actually the faster you

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.076 A:middle
stop, the faster we can detect

00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:25.226 A:middle
it.

00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:27.016 A:middle
So, it's actually responding to

00:11:27.016 --> 00:11:29.126 A:middle
the change in motion, as fast as

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.886 A:middle
we know how, instead of waiting

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:31.676 A:middle
for some timer.

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:34.326 A:middle
So, this is a good example of

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:35.666 A:middle
responding to redirection as

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:37.006 A:middle
fast as possible.

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:40.856 A:middle
So, this is the concept of

00:11:41.196 --> 00:11:42.436 A:middle
interruption and redirection.

00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:44.426 A:middle
This stuff makes the interface

00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:45.936 A:middle
feel really, really connected to

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:46.246 A:middle
you.

00:11:47.596 --> 00:11:50.576 A:middle
Next, we want to talk a little

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.646 A:middle
bit about the architecture of

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:52.096 A:middle
the interface.

00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:52.976 A:middle
How you lay it out,

00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:54.406 A:middle
conceptually.

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:56.596 A:middle
And, we think when you're doing

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:58.006 A:middle
that, it's important to maintain

00:11:58.116 --> 00:11:59.846 A:middle
spatial consistency throughout

00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:00.246 A:middle
movement.
