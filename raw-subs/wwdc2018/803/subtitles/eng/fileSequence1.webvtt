00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.576 A:middle
So, the question we ask

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:04.536 A:middle
ourselves a lot is, what

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.656 A:middle
actually makes an interface feel

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:07.156 A:middle
fluid?

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.826 A:middle
And, we've noticed that a lot of

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.246 A:middle
people actually describe it

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:11.826 A:middle
differently.

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:14.026 A:middle
You know, sometimes, when people

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.226 A:middle
actually try this stuff, when we

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:16.516 A:middle
show them a demo, and they try

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:17.296 A:middle
it, and they hold it in their

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.226 A:middle
hands, they sometimes say it

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:19.636 A:middle
feels fast.

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.356 A:middle
Or, other people sometimes say

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:22.496 A:middle
it feels smooth.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:24.146 A:middle
And, when it's feeling really

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:25.606 A:middle
good, sometimes people even say

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.476 A:middle
it feels natural, or magical.

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:29.766 A:middle
But, when it comes down to it,

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.356 A:middle
it really feels like, it's one

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
of those things where you just

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:34.656 A:middle
know it when you feel it.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:36.206 A:middle
It just feels right.

00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:38.526 A:middle
And, you can have a gestural UI,

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
and we've seen lots of gestural

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.866 A:middle
UI's out there, but if it's not

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:44.526 A:middle
done right, something just feels

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:45.426 A:middle
off about it.

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:47.456 A:middle
And, it's oftentimes hard to put

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:48.556 A:middle
your finger on why.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:50.776 A:middle
And, it's more than just about

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:51.956 A:middle
frame rates, you know.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.236 A:middle
You can have something chugging

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:54.906 A:middle
along at a nice 60 frames per

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:57.746 A:middle
second, but it just feels off.

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:59.626 A:middle
So, what gives us this feeling?
