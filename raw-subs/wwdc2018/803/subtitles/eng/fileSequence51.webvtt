00:50:59.066 --> 00:51:00.686 A:middle
So, if I drag my finger outside

00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:02.976 A:middle
the tap area, and lift it, I can

00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:04.346 A:middle
cancel the tap.

00:51:05.056 --> 00:51:07.266 A:middle
The same way, if I swipe it back

00:51:07.266 --> 00:51:08.686 A:middle
on the button, the button should

00:51:08.686 --> 00:51:09.896 A:middle
highlight again, and let me

00:51:09.896 --> 00:51:11.226 A:middle
confirm the tap.

00:51:12.956 --> 00:51:16.066 A:middle
The next gesture we're going to

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.756 A:middle
talk about is swipe.

00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:19.816 A:middle
Swipes are one of the core

00:51:19.856 --> 00:51:21.786 A:middle
gestures of iOS, and they're

00:51:21.786 --> 00:51:23.466 A:middle
used for multiple actions like

00:51:23.466 --> 00:51:25.316 A:middle
scrolling, dragging, and paging.

00:51:26.606 --> 00:51:27.826 A:middle
But, no matter what you use it

00:51:27.826 --> 00:51:30.006 A:middle
for, or how you call it, the

00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:31.506 A:middle
core principles of a gesture are

00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:32.106 A:middle
always the same.

00:51:32.106 --> 00:51:35.026 A:middle
In this example, we're going to

00:51:35.026 --> 00:51:36.626 A:middle
use a swipe to drag this image

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:37.116 A:middle
to the right.

00:51:38.026 --> 00:51:39.956 A:middle
So, the interaction starts the

00:51:39.956 --> 00:51:40.976 A:middle
moment I touch down on the image

00:51:40.976 --> 00:51:41.976 A:middle
with intention to drag it.

00:51:46.696 --> 00:51:49.126 A:middle
But, before we can be sure it's

00:51:49.126 --> 00:51:50.716 A:middle
a swipe, the touch has to move a

00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:51.576 A:middle
certain distance.

00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:53.876 A:middle
We learn to differentiate swipes

00:51:53.876 --> 00:51:54.976 A:middle
from other gestures.

00:51:55.516 --> 00:51:56.956 A:middle
This distance is called

00:51:56.956 --> 00:51:58.866 A:middle
hysteresis, and is usually 10

00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:00.006 A:middle
points in iOS.
