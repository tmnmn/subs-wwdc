00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:02.916 A:middle
Well, we think it boils down to

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.676 A:middle
when the tool feels like an

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:06.176 A:middle
extension of your mind.

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.506 A:middle
An extension of your mind.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.895 A:middle
So, why is this important?

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:13.526 A:middle
Well, if you look at it, the

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:15.226 A:middle
iPhone is a tool, right?

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:17.486 A:middle
It's a hand tool for information

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:18.396 A:middle
and communication.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:21.286 A:middle
And, it works by marrying our

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:22.986 A:middle
tactile senses with our sense of

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:23.396 A:middle
vision.

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:25.536 A:middle
But, if you think about it, it's

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.846 A:middle
actually part of a long line of

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:29.446 A:middle
hand tools extending back

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:31.056 A:middle
thousands of years.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.286 A:middle
The tool on the left here was

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.036 A:middle
used to extract bone marrow

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:37.846 A:middle
150,000 years ago, extending the

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:38.896 A:middle
sharpness of what our fingers

00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:39.226 A:middle
could do.

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:41.586 A:middle
So, we've been making hand tools

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.686 A:middle
for some time now.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:45.276 A:middle
And, the most amazing thing is

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:46.326 A:middle
that our hands have actually

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.126 A:middle
evolved and adapted alongside

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:49.666 A:middle
our tools.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:51.296 A:middle
We've evolved a huge

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.726 A:middle
concentration of muscles,

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:54.766 A:middle
nerves, blood vessels that can

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:56.136 A:middle
perform the most delicate

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:57.766 A:middle
gestures, and sense the lightest

00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:58.196 A:middle
of touches.

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:01.386 A:middle
So, we're extremely adapted to
