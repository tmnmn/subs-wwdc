00:39:59.086 --> 00:40:00.746 A:middle
cohesive, that you're staying in

00:40:00.746 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
character.

00:40:01.186 --> 00:40:03.506 A:middle
Now, what does this mean?

00:40:04.816 --> 00:40:07.156 A:middle
So, even within your app, or

00:40:07.156 --> 00:40:08.726 A:middle
across the whole system, it's

00:40:08.726 --> 00:40:10.056 A:middle
important that you treat

00:40:10.056 --> 00:40:11.456 A:middle
behaviors as a family of

00:40:11.526 --> 00:40:12.136 A:middle
behaviors.

00:40:13.166 --> 00:40:15.206 A:middle
So, in scrolling for example,

00:40:15.706 --> 00:40:17.936 A:middle
when I scroll down a page, using

00:40:17.936 --> 00:40:19.946 A:middle
a scrolling behavior, and then I

00:40:19.946 --> 00:40:21.946 A:middle
tap the status bar to scroll to

00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:23.196 A:middle
the stop of the page, using an

00:40:23.196 --> 00:40:24.176 A:middle
elastic behavior.

00:40:24.946 --> 00:40:27.316 A:middle
In both cases, the page itself

00:40:27.356 --> 00:40:28.626 A:middle
feels like it's moving in the

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.766 A:middle
same way, that it has the same

00:40:30.766 --> 00:40:32.086 A:middle
behavior, even though two

00:40:32.086 --> 00:40:33.506 A:middle
different types of behaviors are

00:40:33.506 --> 00:40:34.496 A:middle
driving its motion, are

00:40:34.546 --> 00:40:35.726 A:middle
influencing its motion.

00:40:37.036 --> 00:40:38.276 A:middle
Now, this extends beyond a

00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:39.876 A:middle
single interaction like

00:40:39.986 --> 00:40:40.576 A:middle
scrolling.

00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:42.716 A:middle
It applies to your whole app.

00:40:43.236 --> 00:40:45.046 A:middle
If you have a playful app, then

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:46.016 A:middle
you should embrace that

00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:47.676 A:middle
character, and make your whole

00:40:47.676 --> 00:40:49.666 A:middle
app feel the same way.

00:40:49.876 --> 00:40:50.996 A:middle
So, that people-- once they

00:40:50.996 --> 00:40:52.506 A:middle
learn one behavior of your app,

00:40:53.066 --> 00:40:53.936 A:middle
they can pick up another

00:40:53.936 --> 00:40:55.666 A:middle
behavior really easily, because

00:40:55.666 --> 00:40:57.146 A:middle
we learn through repetition.

00:40:57.566 --> 00:40:59.636 A:middle
And, what we learn bleeds over

00:40:59.636 --> 00:41:00.896 A:middle
into other behaviors.
