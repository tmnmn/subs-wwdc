00:53:59.706 --> 00:54:00.956 A:middle
Flashlight button on the iPhone

00:54:00.956 --> 00:54:03.296 A:middle
10, the size of button changes

00:54:03.626 --> 00:54:04.666 A:middle
based on the pressure of my

00:54:04.666 --> 00:54:05.176 A:middle
touch.

00:54:05.786 --> 00:54:06.426 A:middle
And, this gives me a

00:54:06.426 --> 00:54:07.846 A:middle
confirmation of my action.

00:54:08.136 --> 00:54:09.376 A:middle
It shows me the system is

00:54:09.376 --> 00:54:11.206 A:middle
responding to my gesture, but it

00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.946 A:middle
also teaches me that pressing

00:54:12.946 --> 00:54:14.706 A:middle
harder will eventually turn on

00:54:14.706 --> 00:54:15.306 A:middle
the flashlight.

00:54:15.736 --> 00:54:18.246 A:middle
Another good example of

00:54:18.246 --> 00:54:19.966 A:middle
continuous feedback, is the

00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:21.446 A:middle
focus engine on the Apple TV.

00:54:22.466 --> 00:54:23.606 A:middle
So, the movements on the Siri

00:54:23.606 --> 00:54:25.146 A:middle
remote are continuously

00:54:25.146 --> 00:54:26.486 A:middle
represented on the screen.

00:54:26.956 --> 00:54:28.596 A:middle
And, they show me the item that

00:54:28.596 --> 00:54:30.456 A:middle
is currently selected, the

00:54:30.456 --> 00:54:31.736 A:middle
moment the selection is going to

00:54:31.736 --> 00:54:33.666 A:middle
change, and the direction the

00:54:33.666 --> 00:54:37.516 A:middle
selection is going to go.

00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:39.286 A:middle
So, having our UI respond during

00:54:39.286 --> 00:54:41.176 A:middle
the gesture is critical to

00:54:41.176 --> 00:54:42.496 A:middle
create a fluid experience.

00:54:42.886 --> 00:54:44.416 A:middle
For that reason, when

00:54:44.416 --> 00:54:46.146 A:middle
implementing your gestures, you

00:54:46.146 --> 00:54:47.566 A:middle
should avoid methods that are

00:54:47.566 --> 00:54:48.906 A:middle
only detected at the end of the

00:54:48.906 --> 00:54:49.986 A:middle
gesture, like

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.566 A:middle
UISwipeGestureRecognizer.

00:54:52.236 --> 00:54:53.586 A:middle
And, use ones like the actual

00:54:53.586 --> 00:54:54.876 A:middle
touches, or other

00:54:54.926 --> 00:54:56.916 A:middle
gestureRecognizers that provide

00:54:56.916 --> 00:54:58.306 A:middle
all possible information about

00:54:58.306 --> 00:54:59.466 A:middle
the gesture.
