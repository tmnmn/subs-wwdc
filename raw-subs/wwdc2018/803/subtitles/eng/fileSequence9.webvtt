00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
gesture.

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:03.796 A:middle
And, helps with discovery.

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:05.346 A:middle
Because you can discover a new

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:06.776 A:middle
gesture along the path of an

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:07.656 A:middle
existing gesture.

00:09:08.546 --> 00:09:10.886 A:middle
And, it allows you to layer

00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:11.956 A:middle
gestures at the speed of

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:12.706 A:middle
thought.

00:09:13.256 --> 00:09:14.156 A:middle
So, what does that last one

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:14.286 A:middle
mean?

00:09:14.896 --> 00:09:15.986 A:middle
So, let me show you some

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:16.566 A:middle
examples.

00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:17.846 A:middle
And, we've slowed down the

00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:19.196 A:middle
physics on the simulation, so

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:20.626 A:middle
you can actually see a little

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:21.616 A:middle
bit what I'm talking about.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
So, I can swipe to go home, and

00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:27.566 A:middle
then swipe to the next page, or

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.946 A:middle
springboard while I'm going

00:09:28.946 --> 00:09:29.176 A:middle
home.

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.616 A:middle
I can layer these two gestures

00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:31.806 A:middle
once I've internalized them.

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:34.796 A:middle
Another example is that I can

00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:35.846 A:middle
launch an app and realize, oh,

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:37.126 A:middle
actually I need to go to

00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:38.186 A:middle
multitasking, and I can

00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:39.806 A:middle
interrupt the app and go

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:41.396 A:middle
straight to multitasking, while

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:42.256 A:middle
the app is launching.

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:47.296 A:middle
Or, I can launch an app and

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:49.016 A:middle
realize, oh, that was the wrong

00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:49.136 A:middle
app.

00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:51.096 A:middle
And, I can shoot it back home,

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:53.066 A:middle
while I'm launching it.

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:56.406 A:middle
Now, there's one other one where

00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:58.516 A:middle
I can actually just launch an

00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
app, and if I'm in a hurry, I
