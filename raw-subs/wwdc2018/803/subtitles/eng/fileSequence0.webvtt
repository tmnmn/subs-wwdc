Welcome to Designing Fluid

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:39.216 A:middle
Interfaces.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.456 A:middle
My name is Chan.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.826 A:middle
And, I work on the human

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.206 A:middle
interface team here at Apple.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.536 A:middle
And, most recently, I worked on

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:47.536 A:middle
this, the fluid gestural

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.176 A:middle
interface for iPhone 10.

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:53.756 A:middle
So, me, Marcos, and Nathan, we

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:55.146 A:middle
want to share a little bit about

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:56.676 A:middle
what we learned working on this,

00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:58.666 A:middle
and other projects like this in

00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.056 A:middle
the past.
