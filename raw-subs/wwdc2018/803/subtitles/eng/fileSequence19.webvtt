00:19:00.966 --> 00:19:02.736 A:middle
And, it strobes against your

00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:03.626 A:middle
vision, so.

00:19:03.626 --> 00:19:04.576 A:middle
Here's an example of where you

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.656 A:middle
have two things both moving at

00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:07.766 A:middle
30 frames per second.

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:09.276 A:middle
But the one on the left looks a

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:10.596 A:middle
bit smoother than the one on the

00:19:10.596 --> 00:19:11.476 A:middle
right, because the one on the

00:19:11.476 --> 00:19:14.036 A:middle
right is moving so fast, that

00:19:14.606 --> 00:19:15.336 A:middle
it's strobing.

00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:19.086 A:middle
My perception of vision is, kind

00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:19.946 A:middle
of, breaking down.

00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:21.806 A:middle
I don't believe that it's moving

00:19:21.806 --> 00:19:22.676 A:middle
smoothly any more.

00:19:23.566 --> 00:19:24.896 A:middle
So, the important thing to take

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.446 A:middle
away is that it's not just about

00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:27.016 A:middle
framerate.

00:19:27.556 --> 00:19:28.876 A:middle
It's what's in the frames.

00:19:29.746 --> 00:19:31.426 A:middle
So, we're kind of limited by the

00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:32.956 A:middle
framerate, and how fast we can

00:19:32.956 --> 00:19:34.736 A:middle
move and still preserve a smooth

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:35.186 A:middle
motion.

00:19:36.036 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
So, this one's in 30 frames per

00:19:37.806 --> 00:19:38.216 A:middle
second.

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:40.016 A:middle
If we move it up to 60 frames

00:19:40.016 --> 00:19:42.036 A:middle
per second, you can see that we

00:19:42.036 --> 00:19:43.286 A:middle
can actually go a little bit

00:19:43.286 --> 00:19:45.486 A:middle
faster, and still preserve

00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:46.406 A:middle
smooth motion.

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:47.776 A:middle
We can do faster movement

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:48.586 A:middle
without strobing.

00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:50.736 A:middle
And, there's addition tricks we

00:19:50.736 --> 00:19:51.726 A:middle
can do too, we can do things

00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:52.556 A:middle
like motion blur.

00:19:52.556 --> 00:19:55.696 A:middle
Motion blur basically bakes in

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:57.476 A:middle
more information in each frame

00:19:57.476 --> 00:19:59.276 A:middle
about the movement, like the way

00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
your eyes work, and the way a
