00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:03.246 A:middle
The next one is called

00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:04.006 A:middle
rubberbanding.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.156 A:middle
It means we're softly indicating

00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:08.665 A:middle
boundaries of the interface.

00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:12.296 A:middle
So, in this example, the

00:17:12.296 --> 00:17:14.215 A:middle
interface is gradually and

00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:15.626 A:middle
softly letting you know that

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:16.266 A:middle
there's nothing there.

00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:17.346 A:middle
And, it's tracking you

00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:17.796 A:middle
throughout.

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:19.266 A:middle
It's always letting you know

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.165 A:middle
that it's understanding you.

00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:22.026 A:middle
What happens if you didn't do

00:17:22.026 --> 00:17:22.246 A:middle
that?

00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:23.846 A:middle
Well, it would feel like this.

00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:25.106 A:middle
It would feel super harsh and

00:17:25.106 --> 00:17:25.726 A:middle
disconcerting.

00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:27.126 A:middle
You kind of hit a wall there.

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:28.326 A:middle
It would feel broken, right?

00:17:28.776 --> 00:17:29.976 A:middle
And, you actually wouldn't know

00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:31.476 A:middle
the difference between a frozen

00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:33.076 A:middle
phone, and phone that's just at

00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:34.046 A:middle
the top of the edge of the

00:17:34.046 --> 00:17:34.696 A:middle
screen, right?

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:36.406 A:middle
So, it's really important that

00:17:36.406 --> 00:17:37.456 A:middle
it's always telling you that

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:38.346 A:middle
you've reached the edge.

00:17:38.736 --> 00:17:41.706 A:middle
And, this applies to

00:17:41.706 --> 00:17:42.666 A:middle
transitions, too.

00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:43.736 A:middle
It's not just about when you hit

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:45.086 A:middle
the edge, it's also when you

00:17:45.086 --> 00:17:46.836 A:middle
hand off from one thing to

00:17:46.836 --> 00:17:47.466 A:middle
another thing.

00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:50.926 A:middle
Tracking. So, a good example of

00:17:50.926 --> 00:17:53.026 A:middle
this is when you transition from

00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:54.366 A:middle
sliding up the dock to sliding

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:54.876 A:middle
up the app.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:56.926 A:middle
It doesn't just hit a wall, and

00:17:56.926 --> 00:17:58.006 A:middle
one thing stops tracking, and

00:17:58.006 --> 00:17:59.196 A:middle
then the other thing takes over.

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:01.466 A:middle
They both smoothly hand off in
