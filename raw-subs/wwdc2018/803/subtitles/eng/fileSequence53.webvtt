00:52:59.436 --> 00:53:00.696 A:middle
contents should stay attached to

00:53:00.696 --> 00:53:01.326 A:middle
the gesture.

00:53:02.566 --> 00:53:04.066 A:middle
This is one of the principles of

00:53:04.066 --> 00:53:04.516 A:middle
iOS.

00:53:05.086 --> 00:53:06.706 A:middle
You enable scrolling, and makes

00:53:06.706 --> 00:53:08.106 A:middle
the device feel natural and

00:53:08.106 --> 00:53:08.466 A:middle
intuitive.

00:53:08.996 --> 00:53:11.406 A:middle
It's so recognizable and

00:53:11.406 --> 00:53:13.196 A:middle
expected that the moment the

00:53:13.196 --> 00:53:14.446 A:middle
touch and content stop tracking

00:53:14.446 --> 00:53:16.076 A:middle
one-to-one, we immediately

00:53:16.076 --> 00:53:16.646 A:middle
notice it.

00:53:17.106 --> 00:53:18.346 A:middle
And, in the case of scrolling,

00:53:18.406 --> 00:53:20.106 A:middle
it shows us that we've reached

00:53:20.106 --> 00:53:21.836 A:middle
the end of the content.

00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:25.826 A:middle
But, one-to-one tracking is not

00:53:25.826 --> 00:53:27.106 A:middle
limited to touch screens.

00:53:27.686 --> 00:53:30.096 A:middle
For instance, manipulating UI on

00:53:30.096 --> 00:53:31.736 A:middle
the Apple TV was designed around

00:53:31.736 --> 00:53:32.426 A:middle
this concept.

00:53:33.486 --> 00:53:34.686 A:middle
So, even if the touch is not

00:53:34.686 --> 00:53:35.796 A:middle
manipulating the content

00:53:35.796 --> 00:53:37.316 A:middle
directly, having a direct

00:53:37.316 --> 00:53:38.736 A:middle
connection between the gesture

00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:40.436 A:middle
and the interface puts you in

00:53:40.436 --> 00:53:42.106 A:middle
control of the action, and makes

00:53:42.106 --> 00:53:43.246 A:middle
the interaction intuitive.

00:53:47.256 --> 00:53:48.776 A:middle
Another core principle when

00:53:48.776 --> 00:53:50.146 A:middle
designing gestures, is to

00:53:50.146 --> 00:53:51.366 A:middle
provide continuous feedback

00:53:51.366 --> 00:53:52.456 A:middle
during the interaction.

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.176 A:middle
And, this is not just limited to

00:53:54.176 --> 00:53:55.166 A:middle
swipes or drags.

00:53:55.706 --> 00:53:57.536 A:middle
It applies to all interactions.

00:53:58.146 --> 00:53:59.706 A:middle
So, if you look again at the

00:53:59.706 --> 00:54:00.956 A:middle
Flashlight button on the iPhone
