00:36:58.126 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
any overshoot, it can often feel

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:03.506 A:middle
broken or unsatisfying to have

00:37:03.566 --> 00:37:05.236 A:middle
the motion follow that gesture.

00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:08.796 A:middle
An example of where we use this

00:37:08.796 --> 00:37:09.696 A:middle
is in the Music app.

00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:12.186 A:middle
So, the Music app has a small

00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:14.076 A:middle
minibar representing Now Playing

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:15.796 A:middle
at the bottom of the screen, and

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:18.076 A:middle
you can tap the bar to show Now

00:37:18.076 --> 00:37:18.456 A:middle
Playing.

00:37:18.946 --> 00:37:22.306 A:middle
Because the tap doesn't have any

00:37:22.356 --> 00:37:24.316 A:middle
momentum in the direction of the

00:37:24.356 --> 00:37:26.286 A:middle
presentation of Now Playing, we

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:28.606 A:middle
use 100% damping to make sure it

00:37:28.636 --> 00:37:29.486 A:middle
doesn't overshoot.

00:37:30.126 --> 00:37:32.656 A:middle
But, if you swipe to dismiss Now

00:37:32.736 --> 00:37:34.506 A:middle
Playing, there is momentum in

00:37:34.506 --> 00:37:36.566 A:middle
the direction of the dismissal,

00:37:37.016 --> 00:37:39.166 A:middle
and so we use 80% damping to

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.426 A:middle
have a little bit of bounce and

00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:42.306 A:middle
squish, making the gesture a lot

00:37:42.306 --> 00:37:43.126 A:middle
more satisfying.

00:37:46.416 --> 00:37:48.766 A:middle
Bounciness can also be used as a

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.696 A:middle
utility, as a functional means.

00:37:51.476 --> 00:37:53.106 A:middle
It can serve as a helpful hint

00:37:53.176 --> 00:37:54.576 A:middle
that there's something more

00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:57.166 A:middle
below the surface.

00:37:57.306 --> 00:37:59.056 A:middle
With iPhone 10, we introduced

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:01.136 A:middle
two buttons to the cover sheet
