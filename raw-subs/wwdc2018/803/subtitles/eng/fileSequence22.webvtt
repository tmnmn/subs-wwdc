00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:01.606 A:middle
think and work like us.

00:22:02.876 --> 00:22:04.906 A:middle
In-- it starts with response.

00:22:05.496 --> 00:22:06.586 A:middle
To make things feel connected to

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.546 A:middle
you, and to accommodate the way

00:22:08.546 --> 00:22:09.876 A:middle
our minds are constantly in

00:22:09.876 --> 00:22:10.286 A:middle
motion.

00:22:11.156 --> 00:22:12.986 A:middle
To maintain spatial consistency,

00:22:13.246 --> 00:22:15.236 A:middle
to reinforce a consistent sense

00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:17.286 A:middle
of space, and symmetric

00:22:17.286 --> 00:22:18.626 A:middle
transitions within that space.

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.136 A:middle
And, to hint in the direction of

00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:21.646 A:middle
the gesture.

00:22:22.046 --> 00:22:23.526 A:middle
To play into our prediction of

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.036 A:middle
the future.

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:26.586 A:middle
And, to maintain lightweight

00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:28.286 A:middle
interactions, but amplify their

00:22:28.286 --> 00:22:28.686 A:middle
output.

00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:31.286 A:middle
To get that satisfying response,

00:22:31.366 --> 00:22:32.196 A:middle
while still keeping the

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:33.386 A:middle
interaction airy and

00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:33.836 A:middle
lightweight.

00:22:34.506 --> 00:22:38.036 A:middle
And, to have soft boundaries and

00:22:38.036 --> 00:22:39.076 A:middle
edges to the interface.

00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:40.816 A:middle
That interface is always

00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:42.066 A:middle
gracefully responding to you,

00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:43.356 A:middle
even when you hit an edge, or

00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:44.696 A:middle
transition from tracking one

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.726 A:middle
thing to tracking the other.

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:49.456 A:middle
And, to design smooth dynamic

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:51.646 A:middle
behavior that works in concert

00:22:51.646 --> 00:22:51.976 A:middle
with you.

00:22:52.566 --> 00:22:57.516 A:middle
So, that's some principles for

00:22:57.516 --> 00:22:58.366 A:middle
how to approach building

00:22:58.366 --> 00:22:59.656 A:middle
interfaces that feel like an

00:22:59.806 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
extension of our minds.
