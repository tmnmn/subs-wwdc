00:04:57.786 --> 00:05:00.246 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:02.556 A:middle
How do we design an interface

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:04.316 A:middle
that actually extends our mind?

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:05.046 A:middle
How do we do this?

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:07.996 A:middle
Well, we think the way to do it,

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:10.406 A:middle
is to align the interface to the

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:12.396 A:middle
way we think and the way we

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:12.786 A:middle
move.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:14.916 A:middle
So, the most important part of

00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:17.626 A:middle
that is that our minds are

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:19.386 A:middle
constantly responding to changes

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:21.536 A:middle
and stimulus and thought, you

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:21.766 A:middle
know?

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:22.856 A:middle
Our minds and bodies are

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:24.756 A:middle
constantly in a state of dynamic

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:25.286 A:middle
change.

00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:27.226 A:middle
So, it's not that our interfaces

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.746 A:middle
should be fluid, it's that we're

00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
fluid, and our interfaces need

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.626 A:middle
to be able to respond to that.

00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:35.666 A:middle
So, that begins with response.

00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:38.986 A:middle
You know, our tools depend on

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:39.736 A:middle
the latency.

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:41.236 A:middle
Think about how hard it would be

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:43.056 A:middle
to use any tool, or play an

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:44.336 A:middle
instrument, or do anything in

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:45.436 A:middle
the physical world, if there was

00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:46.536 A:middle
a delay to using it?

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:48.516 A:middle
And, we found that people are

00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:49.926 A:middle
really, really sensitive to

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:50.416 A:middle
latency.

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.386 A:middle
You know? If you introduce any

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.876 A:middle
amount of lag, things all of a

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.026 A:middle
sudden just kind of fall off a

00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:57.466 A:middle
cliff in terms of how they

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:58.106 A:middle
respond to you.

00:05:58.106 --> 00:05:59.436 A:middle
There's all this additional

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:00.246 A:middle
mental burden.
