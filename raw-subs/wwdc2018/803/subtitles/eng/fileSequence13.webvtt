00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:01.296 A:middle
This also reinforces the

00:13:01.296 --> 00:13:01.646 A:middle
gesture.

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.336 A:middle
If I choose to slide it myself

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.576 A:middle
to the right, because I know

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:05.586 A:middle
that's where it lives, I can do

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:05.786 A:middle
that.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:06.466 A:middle
It's expected.

00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:08.686 A:middle
So, what if we didn't do this.

00:13:09.146 --> 00:13:10.236 A:middle
Here's an example, where when I

00:13:10.236 --> 00:13:11.816 A:middle
tap on something, it slides in,

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:13.926 A:middle
and then when I hit back it goes

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:14.316 A:middle
down.

00:13:14.316 --> 00:13:15.916 A:middle
And, it feels disconnected and

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:16.796 A:middle
confusing, right?

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:18.826 A:middle
It feels like I'm sending it

00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:19.576 A:middle
somewhere.

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:20.626 A:middle
In fact, if I wanted to

00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:21.736 A:middle
communicate that I was sending

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:22.746 A:middle
it somewhere, this is how I

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:23.616 A:middle
could do it, right?

00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:26.496 A:middle
So, that's the topic of spatial

00:13:26.496 --> 00:13:27.246 A:middle
consistency.

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:29.396 A:middle
It helps the gesture feel

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:30.736 A:middle
aligned with our spatial

00:13:30.736 --> 00:13:33.796 A:middle
understanding of the world.

00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:36.766 A:middle
Now, the next one is to hint in

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:37.906 A:middle
the direction of the gesture.

00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:40.216 A:middle
You know, we humans are always,

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:41.596 A:middle
kind of, predicting the next few

00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:43.356 A:middle
steps of our experience.

00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:44.906 A:middle
We're always using the, kind of,

00:13:44.906 --> 00:13:46.026 A:middle
trajectories of everything

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.546 A:middle
that's happening in the world to

00:13:47.546 --> 00:13:48.796 A:middle
predict the next few steps of

00:13:48.796 --> 00:13:49.296 A:middle
emotion.

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:52.016 A:middle
So, we think it's great when an

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:53.456 A:middle
interface plays into that

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:53.906 A:middle
prediction.

00:13:54.556 --> 00:13:56.246 A:middle
So, if you have two states here,

00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:58.706 A:middle
initial state and a final state.

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
The object-- and you have an
