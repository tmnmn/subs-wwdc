00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.146 A:middle
is where the content wants to go

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:01.596 A:middle
because of its elasticity.

00:32:01.746 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
So, you've got this spring

00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:04.226 A:middle
that's pulling the current value

00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:05.896 A:middle
towards the target.

00:32:06.136 --> 00:32:08.276 A:middle
Its behavior is influencing the

00:32:08.276 --> 00:32:09.376 A:middle
position of the content.

00:32:11.176 --> 00:32:13.126 A:middle
Now, the spring is essentially

00:32:13.126 --> 00:32:14.456 A:middle
pulling that current value

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:15.596 A:middle
towards the target.

00:32:16.636 --> 00:32:18.016 A:middle
And, what's interesting about a

00:32:18.016 --> 00:32:19.116 A:middle
spring is, it does this

00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:19.986 A:middle
seamlessly.

00:32:19.986 --> 00:32:21.396 A:middle
This seamlessness is, kind of,

00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:23.756 A:middle
built in to the behavior.

00:32:25.056 --> 00:32:26.256 A:middle
And, this is what makes them

00:32:26.256 --> 00:32:28.356 A:middle
such versatile tools for doing

00:32:28.356 --> 00:32:30.176 A:middle
fluid interface design.

00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:32.426 A:middle
Is that you, kind of, get this

00:32:32.426 --> 00:32:33.196 A:middle
stuff for free.

00:32:33.536 --> 00:32:35.086 A:middle
It's baked in to the behavior

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:35.476 A:middle
itself.

00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:40.326 A:middle
So, we love this behavior of a

00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.876 A:middle
value moving towards a target.

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.766 A:middle
We can just tell the ball where

00:32:43.766 --> 00:32:45.126 A:middle
to go, and we'll get this

00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:47.696 A:middle
seamless motion of the ball

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:48.896 A:middle
moving towards the target.

00:32:48.896 --> 00:32:50.506 A:middle
But, we want a little bit more

00:32:50.506 --> 00:32:52.446 A:middle
control over how fast it moves.

00:32:53.016 --> 00:32:54.736 A:middle
And, whether it overshoots.

00:32:55.236 --> 00:32:55.986 A:middle
So, how do we do that?

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:58.326 A:middle
Well, we could give the ball a

00:32:58.326 --> 00:33:00.046 A:middle
little more mass, like make it
