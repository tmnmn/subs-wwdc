00:47:58.916 --> 00:48:00.986 A:middle
and seamlessly work in concert

00:48:01.106 --> 00:48:02.946 A:middle
with interactions.

00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:06.976 A:middle
We should be leaning on that

00:48:06.976 --> 00:48:08.646 A:middle
shared intuition that we have

00:48:08.646 --> 00:48:10.086 A:middle
for the physical world around

00:48:10.086 --> 00:48:10.406 A:middle
us.

00:48:10.896 --> 00:48:11.916 A:middle
The things that we learn as

00:48:11.916 --> 00:48:13.316 A:middle
children about how objects

00:48:13.366 --> 00:48:14.766 A:middle
behave and move in the physical

00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:17.506 A:middle
world, apply just as readily to

00:48:17.906 --> 00:48:19.236 A:middle
our dynamic interfaces.

00:48:21.076 --> 00:48:22.246 A:middle
You should remember that

00:48:22.246 --> 00:48:23.416 A:middle
bounciness needs to be

00:48:23.476 --> 00:48:24.146 A:middle
purposeful.

00:48:24.856 --> 00:48:26.346 A:middle
Think about why you're using it,

00:48:26.456 --> 00:48:27.666 A:middle
and whether it's appropriate.

00:48:28.336 --> 00:48:29.686 A:middle
And, make sure that as you add

00:48:30.206 --> 00:48:32.856 A:middle
character, and texture, that

00:48:32.856 --> 00:48:33.726 A:middle
you're balancing it with

00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:34.326 A:middle
utility.

00:48:35.066 --> 00:48:38.096 A:middle
And finally, remember to project

00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:38.866 A:middle
momentum.

00:48:39.226 --> 00:48:40.836 A:middle
Don't just use position, use all

00:48:40.836 --> 00:48:41.826 A:middle
of the information that's at

00:48:41.826 --> 00:48:43.586 A:middle
your disposal to ensure that

00:48:43.586 --> 00:48:45.576 A:middle
motion is aligned with the

00:48:45.576 --> 00:48:47.166 A:middle
intent of where people actually

00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:47.616 A:middle
want to go.

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:51.376 A:middle
And then, take them there.

00:48:51.376 --> 00:48:52.356 A:middle
So, to talk a little bit more

00:48:52.356 --> 00:48:54.126 A:middle
about how to fluidly respond to

00:48:54.276 --> 00:48:56.146 A:middle
gestures and interactions, I'd

00:48:56.146 --> 00:48:57.466 A:middle
like to introduce my colleague,

00:48:57.466 --> 00:48:58.626 A:middle
Marcos, to the stage.

00:48:59.006 --> 00:48:59.956 A:middle
Thanks for having me, everyone.
