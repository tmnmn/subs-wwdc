00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
applied, slowing it down to a

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:02.126 A:middle
complete stop.

00:26:02.126 --> 00:26:05.636 A:middle
Let's look at it again, but this

00:26:05.756 --> 00:26:07.756 A:middle
time we'll plot out the position

00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:08.946 A:middle
of the car over time.

00:26:09.466 --> 00:26:12.826 A:middle
So, at the very start of this

00:26:12.826 --> 00:26:14.186 A:middle
curve it's, kind of, straight,

00:26:14.236 --> 00:26:15.816 A:middle
and pointing up to the right.

00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:17.376 A:middle
And, this shows that the car's

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.056 A:middle
position is moving at a constant

00:26:19.056 --> 00:26:20.906 A:middle
rate, it's kind of unchanging.

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:22.626 A:middle
But then, you'll notice the

00:26:22.626 --> 00:26:24.356 A:middle
curve starts to bend, to

00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:27.406 A:middle
smoothly curve away from this

00:26:27.406 --> 00:26:28.206 A:middle
straight line.

00:26:28.496 --> 00:26:29.696 A:middle
And, this is the brakes being

00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:30.166 A:middle
applied.

00:26:30.406 --> 00:26:32.016 A:middle
The car is decelerating from

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:33.346 A:middle
friction being introduced.

00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:35.796 A:middle
And, by the end of the curve,

00:26:35.796 --> 00:26:36.986 A:middle
the curve is completely flat,

00:26:37.056 --> 00:26:38.206 A:middle
horizontal, showing that the

00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:40.106 A:middle
position is now unchanging.

00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
That the car is stopped.

00:26:42.386 --> 00:26:45.916 A:middle
So, this position curve is

00:26:46.006 --> 00:26:47.726 A:middle
visualizing essentially what we

00:26:47.766 --> 00:26:49.236 A:middle
call seamless motion.

00:26:49.236 --> 00:26:51.446 A:middle
The line is completely unbroken,

00:26:52.286 --> 00:26:53.676 A:middle
and there are no sudden changes

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.426 A:middle
in direction.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.376 A:middle
So, it's smooth and it's

00:26:57.376 --> 00:26:57.916 A:middle
seamless.

00:26:58.426 --> 00:27:00.136 A:middle
Even when, actually, new dynamic
