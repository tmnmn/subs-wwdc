00:39:00.226 --> 00:39:01.746 A:middle
Through changes in light and

00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:04.056 A:middle
color, or texture and feel.

00:39:04.866 --> 00:39:05.756 A:middle
Or even sound.

00:39:06.036 --> 00:39:07.876 A:middle
Many other sensations that we--

00:39:08.386 --> 00:39:11.656 A:middle
our senses can detect.

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.036 A:middle
We feel this is an opportunity

00:39:13.036 --> 00:39:15.556 A:middle
to go even further, go beyond

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:17.626 A:middle
motion, when you're tuning the

00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:18.886 A:middle
character of your app.

00:39:19.946 --> 00:39:21.606 A:middle
By combining dynamic behaviors

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:23.256 A:middle
for motion with dynamic

00:39:23.256 --> 00:39:25.766 A:middle
behaviors for sound and haptics,

00:39:26.346 --> 00:39:28.256 A:middle
you can really fundamentally

00:39:28.256 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
change the way an interface

00:39:29.706 --> 00:39:29.976 A:middle
feels.

00:39:35.216 --> 00:39:37.746 A:middle
So, when you see, and you hear,

00:39:38.256 --> 00:39:40.036 A:middle
and you feel the result of the

00:39:40.076 --> 00:39:42.506 A:middle
gesture, it can transform what

00:39:42.506 --> 00:39:43.986 A:middle
was otherwise just a scrolling

00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:45.316 A:middle
behavior into something that

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:48.056 A:middle
feels like a very tactile

00:39:48.056 --> 00:39:48.746 A:middle
interface.

00:39:49.356 --> 00:39:53.206 A:middle
Now, there's one final note I

00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:54.556 A:middle
want you thinking about when

00:39:54.556 --> 00:39:56.006 A:middle
you're crafting the character of

00:39:56.006 --> 00:39:56.396 A:middle
your app.

00:39:57.336 --> 00:39:59.086 A:middle
And, that's that it feels

00:39:59.086 --> 00:40:00.746 A:middle
cohesive, that you're staying in
