00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.836 A:middle
world are always in a state of

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:02.006 A:middle
dynamic motion, and they're

00:21:02.006 --> 00:21:03.516 A:middle
always being influenced by you.

00:21:03.886 --> 00:21:05.316 A:middle
They don't really work like

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
animations in the animation

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:07.366 A:middle
sense, right?

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.336 A:middle
There's no animation curve

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:10.786 A:middle
prescribed by real life.

00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:12.256 A:middle
So, we want to think about

00:21:12.256 --> 00:21:13.816 A:middle
animation and behavior more as a

00:21:13.866 --> 00:21:15.216 A:middle
conversation between you and the

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:15.626 A:middle
object.

00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:17.376 A:middle
Not prescribed by the interface.

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:20.226 A:middle
So, to move away from static

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:21.436 A:middle
things transitioning into

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:22.926 A:middle
animated things, instead think

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:23.806 A:middle
about behavior.

00:21:24.506 --> 00:21:26.206 A:middle
So, Nathan's about to dive deep

00:21:26.206 --> 00:21:26.826 A:middle
into this one.

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:28.546 A:middle
But, here's a quick example.

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:33.036 A:middle
So, in Photos, there's less mass

00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:36.256 A:middle
on the photos, because it's

00:21:36.826 --> 00:21:38.586 A:middle
conceptually lighter.

00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:40.596 A:middle
But, then when you swipe apps,

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.386 A:middle
there's more mass on the apps.

00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:44.366 A:middle
It's conceptually heavier, so we

00:21:44.366 --> 00:21:45.936 A:middle
give more mass to the system.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:54.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:55.196 --> 00:21:56.366 A:middle
So, that's a little bit about

00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:58.606 A:middle
how to design interfaces that

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:01.606 A:middle
think and work like us.
