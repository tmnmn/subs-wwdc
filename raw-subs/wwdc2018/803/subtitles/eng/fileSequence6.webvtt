00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:00.246 A:middle
mental burden.

00:06:00.546 --> 00:06:01.736 A:middle
It feels super disconnected.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.776 A:middle
It doesn't feel like an

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
extension of you anymore.

00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
So, we work so hard to reduce

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:07.126 A:middle
latency.

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:09.276 A:middle
Where, we actually engineered

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.696 A:middle
the latest iPhone to respond

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:12.286 A:middle
quicker to your finger, so we

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:13.916 A:middle
can detect all the nuances of

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.396 A:middle
your gestures as instantly as

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:15.876 A:middle
possible.

00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:18.086 A:middle
So, we really care about this

00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.486 A:middle
stuff, and we think you should

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:19.826 A:middle
too.

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:23.166 A:middle
And, that means look for delays

00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:23.936 A:middle
everywhere.

00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:25.016 A:middle
It's not just swipes.

00:06:25.016 --> 00:06:26.306 A:middle
It's taps, it's presses, it's

00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:27.546 A:middle
every interaction with the

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:28.066 A:middle
object.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.926 A:middle
Everything needs to respond

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:30.606 A:middle
instantly.

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.486 A:middle
And, during the process of

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:34.076 A:middle
designing this stuff, you know,

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:36.906 A:middle
oftentimes the delays kind of

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:38.796 A:middle
tend to seep in a little bit.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:39.956 A:middle
You know? So, it's really

00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:41.866 A:middle
important to keep an eye out for

00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:42.236 A:middle
delays.

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:44.136 A:middle
Be vigilant and mindful of all

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:46.046 A:middle
the latencies or timers that we

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.086 A:middle
could introduce into the

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:49.026 A:middle
interface so that it always

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:50.016 A:middle
feels responsive.

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:52.406 A:middle
So, that's the topic of

00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:53.256 A:middle
response.

00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:54.906 A:middle
It's really simple, but it makes

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:57.326 A:middle
an interface feel lively and

00:06:58.556 --> 00:06:58.786 A:middle
dynamic.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:02.756 A:middle
Next, we want to allow for
