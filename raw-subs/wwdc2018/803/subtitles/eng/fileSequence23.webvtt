00:22:59.806 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
extension of our minds.

00:23:01.846 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
So, let's dive in a little

00:23:02.786 --> 00:23:03.136 A:middle
deeper.

00:23:03.136 --> 00:23:04.096 A:middle
I'm going to turn it over to

00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:05.396 A:middle
Nathan de Vries, my colleague,

00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:07.616 A:middle
to design motion-- to talk about

00:23:07.616 --> 00:23:09.006 A:middle
designing motion in a way that

00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:10.566 A:middle
feels connected to motion, to

00:23:10.566 --> 00:23:12.346 A:middle
the motion of both you and the

00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:12.976 A:middle
natural world.

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:22.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:23.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chan.

00:23:24.016 --> 00:23:24.686 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.866 A:middle
My name's Nathan, and I'm super

00:23:26.866 --> 00:23:28.406 A:middle
excited to be here today to talk

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:29.796 A:middle
to you about designing with

00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:30.806 A:middle
dynamic motion.

00:23:32.196 --> 00:23:34.666 A:middle
So, as Chan mentioned, our minds

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.326 A:middle
and our bodies are constantly in

00:23:36.326 --> 00:23:37.276 A:middle
a state of change.

00:23:37.396 --> 00:23:38.636 A:middle
The world around us is in a

00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:39.556 A:middle
state of change.

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:42.366 A:middle
And, this introduces this

00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:44.566 A:middle
expectation that our interfaces

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.396 A:middle
behave the same way, as they

00:23:46.396 --> 00:23:48.466 A:middle
become more tactile, it shifts

00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:50.766 A:middle
our expectations to be much

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:51.676 A:middle
higher fidelity.

00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:54.686 A:middle
Now, one way we've used motion

00:23:54.686 --> 00:23:56.806 A:middle
in interfaces is through timed

00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:57.576 A:middle
animations.
