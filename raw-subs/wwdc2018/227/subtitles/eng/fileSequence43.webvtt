00:42:58.856 --> 00:43:00.056 A:middle
about how to use performance

00:43:00.056 --> 00:43:00.566 A:middle
classes.

00:43:02.956 --> 00:43:04.086 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:05.276 A:middle
Sprite atlases.

00:43:06.126 --> 00:43:08.326 A:middle
So Sprite atlases were

00:43:08.356 --> 00:43:09.906 A:middle
introduced a few years ago in

00:43:09.906 --> 00:43:11.476 A:middle
support of SpriteKit

00:43:11.616 --> 00:43:13.956 A:middle
applications in SpriteKit games.

00:43:15.336 --> 00:43:17.406 A:middle
Now, but I'm not going to talk

00:43:17.406 --> 00:43:18.466 A:middle
about them in the context of

00:43:18.466 --> 00:43:20.996 A:middle
SpriteKit based games, I'm going

00:43:20.996 --> 00:43:22.186 A:middle
to talk about them in the

00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:23.586 A:middle
context of regular applications.

00:43:25.466 --> 00:43:27.456 A:middle
Now they have some attributes

00:43:27.456 --> 00:43:28.796 A:middle
that are very similar to what

00:43:28.796 --> 00:43:30.056 A:middle
Will talked about with automatic

00:43:30.056 --> 00:43:31.936 A:middle
image packing, you're taking all

00:43:31.936 --> 00:43:33.006 A:middle
of the related images in that

00:43:33.006 --> 00:43:34.276 A:middle
Sprite atlas and packing them

00:43:34.276 --> 00:43:35.486 A:middle
into a single unit, they get

00:43:35.486 --> 00:43:37.476 A:middle
loaded at once, and then all the

00:43:37.476 --> 00:43:38.716 A:middle
images that you reference that

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:40.076 A:middle
are contained within that atlas

00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:41.886 A:middle
are just lightweight references

00:43:42.076 --> 00:43:44.096 A:middle
to locations within that atlas.

00:43:45.486 --> 00:43:46.186 A:middle
So that's great.

00:43:46.676 --> 00:43:49.716 A:middle
But the key thing is that you

00:43:49.716 --> 00:43:51.096 A:middle
don't really need to use

00:43:51.186 --> 00:43:52.616 A:middle
SpriteKit to access these, you

00:43:52.616 --> 00:43:53.826 A:middle
can just use this as a grouping

00:43:53.826 --> 00:43:54.946 A:middle
mechanism because the one

00:43:54.946 --> 00:43:56.146 A:middle
difference that Sprite atlases

00:43:56.146 --> 00:43:57.216 A:middle
have over automatic image

00:43:57.216 --> 00:43:58.586 A:middle
packing is you get to control

00:43:58.586 --> 00:44:00.486 A:middle
the grouping and you to assign a
