00:39:58.436 --> 00:40:00.206 A:middle
actually matches exactly to my

00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
GPU class.

00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:04.736 A:middle
But because we prefer and scan

00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:05.796 A:middle
through things in memory

00:40:05.796 --> 00:40:07.176 A:middle
priority order before we do

00:40:07.176 --> 00:40:08.376 A:middle
graphics classes, we're going to

00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:09.126 A:middle
select this first.

00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:10.366 A:middle
This is really important because

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:11.966 A:middle
we have decided that memory is

00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:13.126 A:middle
really the most important way

00:40:13.126 --> 00:40:14.086 A:middle
that you can characterize the

00:40:14.086 --> 00:40:15.436 A:middle
overall performance of a device,

00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:17.516 A:middle
so we're going to prefer that as

00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:19.026 A:middle
we go through the selection

00:40:19.026 --> 00:40:19.526 A:middle
matrix.

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:23.046 A:middle
Okay that's how it works, how do

00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:24.006 A:middle
you think about using it.

00:40:24.916 --> 00:40:26.616 A:middle
Memory really represents the

00:40:26.616 --> 00:40:28.346 A:middle
overall headroom of your device

00:40:28.776 --> 00:40:30.336 A:middle
and is really the best aggregate

00:40:30.336 --> 00:40:31.796 A:middle
indicator of capability.

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:33.006 A:middle
So it's a really good choice to

00:40:33.006 --> 00:40:34.426 A:middle
use with larger or richer

00:40:34.426 --> 00:40:35.896 A:middle
assets, more detailed stuff,

00:40:35.896 --> 00:40:37.256 A:middle
things that are bigger on disk,

00:40:37.576 --> 00:40:38.306 A:middle
things that are going to take a

00:40:38.306 --> 00:40:39.196 A:middle
little more memory when they're

00:40:39.196 --> 00:40:41.416 A:middle
expanded in in memory for

00:40:41.416 --> 00:40:41.836 A:middle
rendering.

00:40:42.486 --> 00:40:44.046 A:middle
Just a richer user experience is

00:40:44.046 --> 00:40:45.076 A:middle
usually associated with higher

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:45.336 A:middle
memory.

00:40:45.826 --> 00:40:47.116 A:middle
Now higher graphics is a little

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:48.946 A:middle
more subtle since that tracks

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.566 A:middle
the raw processing capability,

00:40:50.566 --> 00:40:52.626 A:middle
both CPU and GPU, of the device

00:40:52.846 --> 00:40:54.166 A:middle
so it's better for more complex

00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:54.646 A:middle
assets.

00:40:55.436 --> 00:40:57.696 A:middle
Maybe you use a shader that

00:40:57.696 --> 00:40:58.526 A:middle
takes advantage of certain

00:40:58.526 --> 00:40:59.536 A:middle
features that are only available

00:40:59.536 --> 00:41:01.326 A:middle
on certain GPUs or not or you
