00:16:59.776 --> 00:17:01.876 A:middle
generated for the iOS 11 and

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:03.126 A:middle
earlier versions of the

00:17:03.126 --> 00:17:03.626 A:middle
variants.

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:07.175 A:middle
Now because garage band is a

00:17:07.175 --> 00:17:08.856 A:middle
fairly large project, with tens

00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:10.316 A:middle
of thousands of image artwork

00:17:11.165 --> 00:17:12.376 A:middle
the sizes of the generated

00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:15.516 A:middle
variants range from 90 to over

00:17:15.516 --> 00:17:16.396 A:middle
100 megabytes.

00:17:19.586 --> 00:17:21.415 A:middle
And here are the numbers for the

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.536 A:middle
iOS 12 variants.

00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:25.675 A:middle
And again from this graph it is

00:17:25.866 --> 00:17:27.516 A:middle
immediately obvious that we're

00:17:27.516 --> 00:17:29.896 A:middle
getting about from 10 to 20%

00:17:29.896 --> 00:17:31.976 A:middle
saving sizes in size reductions.

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:34.556 A:middle
Now if this number looks

00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:36.786 A:middle
familiar to you by now all of

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:38.786 A:middle
these optimizations are from all

00:17:38.786 --> 00:17:39.896 A:middle
the optimizations and

00:17:39.896 --> 00:17:40.746 A:middle
compressions that I just talked

00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:40.966 A:middle
about.

00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:47.666 A:middle
So that is image compression.

00:17:48.886 --> 00:17:50.046 A:middle
Now I'd like to hand it to my

00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:51.896 A:middle
colleague Patrick to talk about

00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:53.916 A:middle
design and production of your

00:17:53.916 --> 00:17:54.846 A:middle
application asset.

00:17:55.516 --> 00:17:58.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:59.266 --> 00:17:59.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Will.
