00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:00.036 A:middle
App Thinning.

00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:01.886 A:middle
So overall what you're trying to

00:36:01.886 --> 00:36:03.806 A:middle
do is you're providing all the

00:36:03.806 --> 00:36:04.796 A:middle
content variants for your

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:06.136 A:middle
application, you're adapting

00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:07.836 A:middle
your content to the needs of the

00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:09.236 A:middle
various devices your app runs

00:36:09.236 --> 00:36:09.366 A:middle
on.

00:36:09.366 --> 00:36:10.996 A:middle
The most common technique for

00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:12.446 A:middle
doing this is you know split

00:36:12.446 --> 00:36:14.566 A:middle
across product family iPad or

00:36:14.566 --> 00:36:18.856 A:middle
iPhone, tv or watch or different

00:36:18.856 --> 00:36:21.146 A:middle
resolutions, 3x and 2x.

00:36:21.886 --> 00:36:23.056 A:middle
You provide all those content

00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:24.306 A:middle
variants to effectively adapt

00:36:24.306 --> 00:36:25.936 A:middle
your content and then App

00:36:25.936 --> 00:36:27.096 A:middle
Thinning is responsible for

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:28.776 A:middle
making sure that we just select

00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:30.346 A:middle
the right subset of that content

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:31.176 A:middle
that's appropriate for the

00:36:31.176 --> 00:36:32.586 A:middle
device that your customer is

00:36:32.586 --> 00:36:35.076 A:middle
running the application on.

00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:37.566 A:middle
Well I'd like to talk about a

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:39.176 A:middle
different way you can approach

00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:40.306 A:middle
the same sort of content

00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:42.176 A:middle
adaptation and that is

00:36:42.176 --> 00:36:43.266 A:middle
performance classes.

00:36:43.266 --> 00:36:44.266 A:middle
It's a different way of looking

00:36:44.266 --> 00:36:45.346 A:middle
at the exact same problem.

00:36:46.136 --> 00:36:48.356 A:middle
What if the entire product mix

00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:50.506 A:middle
the way your application saw

00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:53.516 A:middle
that continuum was instead

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:54.836 A:middle
segmented by performance

00:36:54.836 --> 00:36:56.826 A:middle
capability, not by other

00:36:56.826 --> 00:36:58.096 A:middle
characteristics?

00:36:58.886 --> 00:36:59.786 A:middle
Well this is what you can do

00:36:59.786 --> 00:37:00.736 A:middle
with Asset Catalogs.
