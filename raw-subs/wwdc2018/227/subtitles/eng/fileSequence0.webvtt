Optimizing App Assets, my name

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:30.996 A:middle
is Will, engineer on the Cocoa

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.156 A:middle
Frameworks group and today make

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:35.266 A:middle
my coworker Patrick and I are

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.176 A:middle
going to go through some of the

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.056 A:middle
best practices for optimizing

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.296 A:middle
assets in your application.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.726 A:middle

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:50.506 A:middle
of assets in their application.

attract a large number of

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.586 A:middle
audience, as well as they're

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:56.266 A:middle
engaging.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.296 A:middle
We want this to be true for all

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.196 A:middle
of your apps as well and that is
