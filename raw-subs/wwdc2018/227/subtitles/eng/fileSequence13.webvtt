00:12:57.346 --> 00:13:00.926 A:middle
App thinning is able to take

00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:02.676 A:middle
care of generating all the

00:13:02.676 --> 00:13:04.596 A:middle
variants of your project and

00:13:04.596 --> 00:13:06.786 A:middle
deploy the most optimal one

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.896 A:middle
across all of your user base.

00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:12.196 A:middle
This year if you build your

00:13:12.196 --> 00:13:14.116 A:middle
project with Xcode 10 and the

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:17.016 A:middle
iOS 12 family of SDKs, your

00:13:17.016 --> 00:13:18.546 A:middle
project is automatically going

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:19.606 A:middle
to benefit from all the

00:13:19.606 --> 00:13:20.896 A:middle
optimizations and new

00:13:20.896 --> 00:13:22.186 A:middle
compressions that I just talked

00:13:22.186 --> 00:13:22.556 A:middle
about.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:27.456 A:middle
However, if you back deploy your

00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:28.566 A:middle
application to an earlier

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:33.026 A:middle
version the new optimizations

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:34.216 A:middle
are not preserved.

00:13:35.836 --> 00:13:37.156 A:middle
And that is because App Thinning

00:13:37.726 --> 00:13:39.116 A:middle
has to generate variants that

00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:40.456 A:middle
are compatible to the earlier

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:41.986 A:middle
versions of the targeted

00:13:41.986 --> 00:13:42.466 A:middle
platform.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:47.396 A:middle
This isn't ideal and more

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:48.826 A:middle
importantly, we really want all

00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:50.986 A:middle
of your assets to be deployed in

00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:52.156 A:middle
the most optimal manner.

00:13:52.886 --> 00:13:54.546 A:middle
So I'm happy to announce this

00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:56.646 A:middle
year we're introducing a new

00:13:56.646 --> 00:13:59.176 A:middle
version of App Thinning, called

00:13:59.176 --> 00:13:59.926 A:middle
OS Variant Thinning.
