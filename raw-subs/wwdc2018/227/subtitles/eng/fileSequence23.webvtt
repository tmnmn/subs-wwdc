00:22:58.506 --> 00:23:00.106 A:middle
Okay now let's get into some

00:23:00.106 --> 00:23:03.496 A:middle
actual software art here.

00:23:03.496 --> 00:23:08.396 A:middle
Okay so you may have, your UI

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:10.296 A:middle
typically has to adapt to a lot

00:23:10.296 --> 00:23:11.436 A:middle
of different presentations and

00:23:11.436 --> 00:23:14.026 A:middle
layouts, this can commonly call

00:23:14.026 --> 00:23:15.706 A:middle
for artwork that actually needs

00:23:15.756 --> 00:23:18.576 A:middle
to stretch and grow to adapt to

00:23:18.576 --> 00:23:19.546 A:middle
those layout changes.

00:23:20.076 --> 00:23:21.126 A:middle
How do you accomplish this with

00:23:21.126 --> 00:23:21.616 A:middle
artwork?

00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:24.396 A:middle
Well the most common approach is

00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:25.976 A:middle
to identify a stretchable

00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:27.176 A:middle
portion of the image and the

00:23:27.176 --> 00:23:28.266 A:middle
unstretchable portions of the

00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:28.556 A:middle
image.

00:23:29.056 --> 00:23:29.986 A:middle
Why is there a difference?

00:23:29.986 --> 00:23:31.576 A:middle
Well considering, this is a

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:33.136 A:middle
crude example here on the slide,

00:23:33.136 --> 00:23:34.146 A:middle
but imagine that we had a

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.686 A:middle
beautiful shape to the overall

00:23:35.686 --> 00:23:36.946 A:middle
asset and like round corners

00:23:36.946 --> 00:23:37.856 A:middle
that you wanted to preserve at

00:23:37.856 --> 00:23:39.576 A:middle
all possible sizes like a frame.

00:23:40.276 --> 00:23:41.126 A:middle
You want to make sure that you

00:23:41.126 --> 00:23:42.486 A:middle
don't stretch those pieces, the

00:23:42.486 --> 00:23:44.126 A:middle
blue pieces in this slide but

00:23:44.126 --> 00:23:45.396 A:middle
you can stretch the yellow

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:45.786 A:middle
pieces.

00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:48.286 A:middle
So traditionally the way this is

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:50.236 A:middle
done is with the modern design

00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:52.066 A:middle
tools is to slice all these

00:23:52.256 --> 00:23:54.276 A:middle
items up, identify all these

00:23:54.276 --> 00:23:55.556 A:middle
regions, and distribute them as

00:23:55.556 --> 00:23:56.716 A:middle
individual assets.

00:23:57.096 --> 00:23:58.746 A:middle
Then the programmer would

00:23:58.746 --> 00:24:00.426 A:middle
reassemble these in the final
