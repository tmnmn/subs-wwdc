00:21:58.136 --> 00:22:00.006 A:middle
really killer take it up to the

00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:01.566 A:middle
next notch vibrant design like

00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:03.236 A:middle
this wonderful flower icon here

00:22:03.236 --> 00:22:05.206 A:middle
for example you may want to take

00:22:05.206 --> 00:22:06.466 A:middle
advantage of the wide color

00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:08.306 A:middle
characteristics, capabilities of

00:22:08.306 --> 00:22:11.716 A:middle
some of our devices and use the

00:22:11.716 --> 00:22:14.406 A:middle
wide color, use a generated wide

00:22:14.406 --> 00:22:15.006 A:middle
color asset.

00:22:15.006 --> 00:22:16.466 A:middle
For this we recommend you use

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:18.096 A:middle
Display P3 as your working

00:22:18.096 --> 00:22:20.456 A:middle
profile and 16 bits per channel

00:22:20.456 --> 00:22:21.496 A:middle
to make sure you don't lose

00:22:21.496 --> 00:22:23.766 A:middle
anything in executing that

00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:24.166 A:middle
design.

00:22:25.206 --> 00:22:27.186 A:middle
Now Xcode and the platforms,

00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:28.536 A:middle
runtime platforms have a wide

00:22:28.536 --> 00:22:30.246 A:middle
range of processing and

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:31.606 A:middle
management options to handle

00:22:31.606 --> 00:22:33.346 A:middle
this wide color asset.

00:22:34.126 --> 00:22:35.156 A:middle
I'm not going to go into too

00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:36.786 A:middle
much depth here, but I encourage

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:38.706 A:middle
you to refer to and look at the

00:22:38.706 --> 00:22:40.226 A:middle
Working with Wide Color session

00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:42.366 A:middle
that I did two years ago where I

00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:43.576 A:middle
went into some depth on these

00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:44.526 A:middle
topics and it gives you some

00:22:44.526 --> 00:22:45.556 A:middle
more background for this.

00:22:45.976 --> 00:22:48.536 A:middle
Also, new since last year

00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.496 A:middle
there's a great treatment of

00:22:50.496 --> 00:22:52.046 A:middle
working with P3 assets up on the

00:22:52.046 --> 00:22:54.066 A:middle
iOS Design Resources section of

00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:55.916 A:middle
the developer.apple.com website.

00:22:58.506 --> 00:23:00.106 A:middle
Okay now let's get into some
