00:06:58.716 --> 00:07:00.236 A:middle
high-efficiency file image

00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:02.636 A:middle
format on all of our platforms,

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.826 A:middle
as well as in the Asset Catalog

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:05.246 A:middle
editor.

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:08.216 A:middle
This year we're taking it one

00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
step further, we're making

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.276 A:middle
high-efficiency image file

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:12.846 A:middle
format with default lossy

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:13.956 A:middle
compression in Asset Catalog.

[ Applause ]

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:22.856 A:middle
Thank you.

00:07:23.846 --> 00:07:25.836 A:middle
Now let's have a quick recap of

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:26.816 A:middle
some of the benefits that we get

00:07:26.816 --> 00:07:28.636 A:middle
from high-efficiency image file

00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:29.026 A:middle
format.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.076 A:middle
The most important thing to know

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.396 A:middle
that it's able to offer much

00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:35.776 A:middle
better compression ratio than

00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:36.976 A:middle
compared to some of the existing

00:07:36.976 --> 00:07:38.356 A:middle
lossy compression that we

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:39.056 A:middle
already offer.

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:41.246 A:middle
One that you may be already

00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:43.566 A:middle
familiar with is JPEG.

00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:46.706 A:middle
There are many benefits that

00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:48.046 A:middle
come with this high-efficiency

00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:50.146 A:middle
image file format, such as

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:51.766 A:middle
support for transparency out of

00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:52.186 A:middle
the box.

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.726 A:middle
And more importantly, it's

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.836 A:middle
important to be aware that Asset

00:07:57.836 --> 00:07:59.266 A:middle
Catalog is able to automatically

00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:01.246 A:middle
convert image files from other
