[Okay so you may have, your UI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1383) [typically has to adapt to a

[Well the most common approach is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1402) [to identify a

[image.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1408) [Why is there a difference?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1409) [Well considering, this is a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1409) [crude example here on the slide,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1411) [but imagine that we had a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1413) [beautiful shape to the overall](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1414) [asset and like round corners](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1415) [that you wanted to preserve at](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1416) [all possible sizes like a frame.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1417) [You want to make sure that you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1420) [don't stretch those pieces, the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1421) [blue pieces in this slide but](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1422) [you can stretch the yellow](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1424) [pieces.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1425) [So traditionally the way this is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1426) [done is with the modern design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1428) [tools is to slice all these](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1430) [items up, identify all these](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1432) [regions, and distribute them as](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1434) [individual assets.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1435) [Then the programmer would](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1437) [reassemble these in the final](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1438) [reassemble these in the final](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1438)

example.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1442) [Now this works fine and has been](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1444) [a tried and true practice for](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1447) [many years, but it does have a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1448) [downside.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1449) [Reassembling those images at a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1450) [final size is a pretty CPU](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1452) [intensive task and it can be a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1453) [bit complex and inefficient and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1456) [it's not really a good fit for](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1457)

approach?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1465) [A better approach is to take a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1467) [single image and just provide](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=1469)

correspond to Metal](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2284) [feature family sets, which if](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2286) [you're a Metal programmer you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2288)

concept.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2290) [But they actually correspond](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2291) [also exactly with a

these](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2318) [two traits together to form a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2320)

how does this work?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2332) [I'd like to explain this to you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2334) [by walking through a simple](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2336)

this example, we've](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2343) [provided three specialized](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2344) [assets, one any any which is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2345) [just the backstop for the lower](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2347) [capability devices.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2349) [And then we provide two](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2351) [optimized assets, one for 3 GB](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2352) [devices with Metal 3 or better](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2354) [and one for 2 GB devices

that I'm](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2360) [selecting the asset from the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2362) [context or the viewpoint of an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2364) [iPhone 8 Plus.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2365) [So I'm 4 GB, Metal 4,

really important because](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2409) [we have decided that memory

[that you can characterize the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2413) [overall performance of a device,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2414) [so we're going to prefer that as](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2415) [we go through the selection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2417) [matrix.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2419) [Okay that's how it works, how do](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2421) [you think about using it.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/227/?time=2423)
