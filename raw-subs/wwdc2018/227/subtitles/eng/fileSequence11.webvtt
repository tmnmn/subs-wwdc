00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:02.556 A:middle
built projects, which is a

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:02.976 A:middle
pretty big deal.

00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:08.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:11.976 A:middle
Now let's look at some numbers.

00:11:15.186 --> 00:11:16.656 A:middle
Here's a chart that shows you

00:11:16.846 --> 00:11:18.586 A:middle
the overall size of all the

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:20.896 A:middle
Asset Catalogs from some of our

00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:22.486 A:middle
select platforms.

00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:25.316 A:middle
And it is immediately obvious

00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:27.606 A:middle
that we're able to see about up

00:11:27.716 --> 00:11:30.086 A:middle
to 20% size reductions across

00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:30.956 A:middle
all of our platforms.

00:11:36.046 --> 00:11:37.206 A:middle
When it comes to lossless

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:39.216 A:middle
compression, compression ratio

00:11:39.216 --> 00:11:40.426 A:middle
is only half the story.

00:11:41.556 --> 00:11:42.386 A:middle
Because of the fact that

00:11:42.386 --> 00:11:44.336 A:middle
lossless compression is used for

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:46.086 A:middle
the majority of your application

00:11:46.086 --> 00:11:48.496 A:middle
artwork, decode time is just

00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:49.456 A:middle
important as well.

00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:51.886 A:middle
Apple Deep Pixel Image

00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:54.056 A:middle
Compression is also able to

00:11:54.056 --> 00:11:56.656 A:middle
offer up to 20% improvement in

00:11:56.656 --> 00:11:56.966 A:middle
decode time.
