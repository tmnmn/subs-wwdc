convert image files from other

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:03.676 A:middle
formats to high-efficiency image

00:08:03.676 --> 00:08:05.686 A:middle
file formats, which means that

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:07.916 A:middle
as long as your image assets are

00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:09.396 A:middle
tagged to this lossy compression

00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:12.606 A:middle
there are no extra required, no

00:08:12.606 --> 00:08:14.186 A:middle
extra action required on your

00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:14.476 A:middle
end.

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.486 A:middle
This all happens automatically

00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:18.346 A:middle
in the Asset Catalog compilation

00:08:18.346 --> 00:08:18.806 A:middle
pipeline.

00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:22.636 A:middle
For more in-depth information on

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:23.766 A:middle
high-efficiency image file

00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:26.086 A:middle
format, I suggest you refer to

00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:26.956 A:middle
our session from last year.

00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:33.535 A:middle
Now let's shift our focus to

00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:34.515 A:middle
lossless compression.

00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:37.035 A:middle
Lossless compression is the

00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:39.066 A:middle
default compression type and

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:40.826 A:middle
it's used for the majority of

00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:41.856 A:middle
application assets.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.376 A:middle
Therefore, it is really

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:45.856 A:middle
important to understand how you

00:08:45.856 --> 00:08:47.406 A:middle
can get the most benefit out of

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:47.976 A:middle
lossy compression.

00:08:51.716 --> 00:08:54.236 A:middle
Typically image artwork can be

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:55.786 A:middle
categorized into two groups

00:08:55.956 --> 00:08:57.256 A:middle
based on their color spectrum

00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:00.046 A:middle
profile, and they each benefit
