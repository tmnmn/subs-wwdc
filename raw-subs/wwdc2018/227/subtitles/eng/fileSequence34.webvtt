00:33:59.456 --> 00:34:00.556 A:middle
-- to the other components of

00:34:00.556 --> 00:34:01.406 A:middle
your application.

00:34:02.756 --> 00:34:04.616 A:middle
How do you retrieve these?

00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:07.976 A:middle
It's simple, you just use the

00:34:08.036 --> 00:34:10.235 A:middle
image constructors like UIImage

00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:12.025 A:middle
named in bundle compatible with

00:34:12.025 --> 00:34:13.596 A:middle
trait collection that gives the

00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:14.576 A:middle
bundle argument.

00:34:14.576 --> 00:34:15.866 A:middle
On the macOS side of course

00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:17.226 A:middle
there's the NS bundle category

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:18.436 A:middle
image for resource.

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.806 A:middle
And keep in mind, that each of

00:34:21.806 --> 00:34:23.295 A:middle
these bundles provide a unique

00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:25.795 A:middle
namespace, so within them the

00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:27.536 A:middle
names have to be unique.

00:34:27.536 --> 00:34:29.946 A:middle
But across bundles you feel free

00:34:29.946 --> 00:34:31.626 A:middle
to use any naming convention you

00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:31.866 A:middle
like.

00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:36.235 A:middle
So speaking of namespaces,

00:34:36.235 --> 00:34:37.496 A:middle
there's another feature I'd like

00:34:37.496 --> 00:34:39.496 A:middle
to call attention to and another

00:34:39.556 --> 00:34:41.016 A:middle
challenge with large projects.

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:43.815 A:middle
Now in this case the problem I'm

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:46.156 A:middle
addressing is large collections

00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:47.446 A:middle
where they might have some

00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:49.806 A:middle
structure in them right.

00:34:50.286 --> 00:34:52.266 A:middle
So let's imagine you have an app

00:34:52.266 --> 00:34:53.775 A:middle
that deals with 50 different

00:34:53.775 --> 00:34:55.216 A:middle
rooms, each one of those rooms

00:34:55.216 --> 00:34:56.585 A:middle
has a table and a chair in it

00:34:56.585 --> 00:34:57.656 A:middle
and there's assets for each of

00:34:57.656 --> 00:34:57.976 A:middle
those.

00:34:58.216 --> 00:34:59.326 A:middle
In your code you'd really like

00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:00.516 A:middle
to refer to them as table and
