00:29:58.376 --> 00:30:00.426 A:middle
Well what are some techniques

00:30:00.426 --> 00:30:01.736 A:middle
that can be used to address

00:30:01.736 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
this?

00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:06.106 A:middle
One common design technique is

00:30:06.106 --> 00:30:07.396 A:middle
to turn on point boundary

00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:08.796 A:middle
snapping in your vector design

00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:11.806 A:middle
tool, set up a grid at one-point

00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:13.496 A:middle
intervals and turn on snapping

00:30:13.496 --> 00:30:15.106 A:middle
so that when you adjust your

00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:16.496 A:middle
shape or your control points

00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:17.366 A:middle
that you know that they can

00:30:17.366 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
snap, when they snap to a

00:30:18.876 --> 00:30:19.726 A:middle
boundary you know that that's

00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:23.416 A:middle
going to be a pixel boundary and

00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:23.916 A:middle
that's great.

00:30:24.836 --> 00:30:26.506 A:middle
But there's still some cases

00:30:26.506 --> 00:30:27.866 A:middle
that you might have with a

00:30:27.866 --> 00:30:29.626 A:middle
design where some of the edges

00:30:29.626 --> 00:30:31.476 A:middle
are still perhaps landing

00:30:31.606 --> 00:30:34.596 A:middle
somewhere in between one and two

00:30:34.596 --> 00:30:35.546 A:middle
and you're not sure, but you'd

00:30:35.546 --> 00:30:37.086 A:middle
really like to know, especially

00:30:37.086 --> 00:30:38.476 A:middle
on a retina 2x device what's

00:30:38.476 --> 00:30:39.876 A:middle
going to happen there and can I

00:30:39.876 --> 00:30:42.216 A:middle
optimize further for the actual

00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:42.846 A:middle
display density.

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:44.976 A:middle
Well what you can do is you can

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:46.456 A:middle
actually use a 2x grid, make

00:30:46.456 --> 00:30:48.206 A:middle
your asset twice as nominally

00:30:48.206 --> 00:30:49.636 A:middle
big in your vector design tool

00:30:50.126 --> 00:30:52.216 A:middle
and make that grid now be a

00:30:52.216 --> 00:30:54.566 A:middle
one-pixel grid where every two

00:30:54.566 --> 00:30:56.206 A:middle
points, every two units is going

00:30:56.206 --> 00:30:57.416 A:middle
to be one point for retina.

00:30:58.676 --> 00:31:01.066 A:middle
And then adjust your assets and
