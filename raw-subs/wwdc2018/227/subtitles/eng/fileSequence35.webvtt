00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:00.516 A:middle
to refer to them as table and

00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:01.516 A:middle
chair, that seems like the most

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:02.886 A:middle
natural thing but unfortunately

00:35:02.886 --> 00:35:03.976 A:middle
there's 50 of them what are you

00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:05.076 A:middle
going to do.

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.616 A:middle
One alternative is to just

00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:08.616 A:middle
generate a naming convention of

00:35:08.616 --> 00:35:09.856 A:middle
some form and figure out how to

00:35:09.856 --> 00:35:11.776 A:middle
demux that in your code, that's

00:35:11.816 --> 00:35:12.326 A:middle
not ideal.

00:35:13.186 --> 00:35:14.696 A:middle
One solution that Asset Catalogs

00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:16.726 A:middle
can offer is to use the provide

00:35:16.726 --> 00:35:18.236 A:middle
namespace option.

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:21.376 A:middle
By checking this box after

00:35:21.506 --> 00:35:23.186 A:middle
organizing your artwork into a

00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:25.666 A:middle
folder, we will automatically

00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:28.126 A:middle
prepend the folder name into

00:35:29.456 --> 00:35:32.096 A:middle
each image's record in the Asset

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:34.406 A:middle
Catalog, which you then use to

00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:34.856 A:middle
retrieve it.

00:35:35.486 --> 00:35:36.816 A:middle
This can be a nice way to

00:35:36.816 --> 00:35:38.596 A:middle
organize large structure

00:35:38.596 --> 00:35:39.616 A:middle
collections of assets.

00:35:40.776 --> 00:35:44.076 A:middle
Okay so we talked about

00:35:44.076 --> 00:35:46.786 A:middle
cataloging, now let's talk about

00:35:46.786 --> 00:35:47.806 A:middle
some exciting stuff around

00:35:47.806 --> 00:35:49.806 A:middle
deployment which is really where

00:35:49.806 --> 00:35:51.316 A:middle
the exciting stuff starts to

00:35:52.106 --> 00:35:53.636 A:middle
kick in.

00:35:53.846 --> 00:35:55.136 A:middle
So Will talked about App

00:35:55.136 --> 00:35:56.926 A:middle
Thinning, I'd like to give some

00:35:56.926 --> 00:35:58.226 A:middle
overall perspective on what we

00:35:58.226 --> 00:35:59.596 A:middle
try to do with Asset Catalogs in

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:00.036 A:middle
App Thinning.
