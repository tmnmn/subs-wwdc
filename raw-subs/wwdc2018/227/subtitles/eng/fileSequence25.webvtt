00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.456 A:middle
identify the stretchable

00:25:00.456 --> 00:25:02.526 A:middle
portions of the image and the

00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:03.526 A:middle
unstretchable portions of the

00:25:03.526 --> 00:25:03.806 A:middle
image.

00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:05.616 A:middle
In this example the left and

00:25:05.616 --> 00:25:06.786 A:middle
right end caps and then that

00:25:06.876 --> 00:25:08.646 A:middle
middle slice that's orange is

00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:09.596 A:middle
the one that's the stretchable

00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:09.956 A:middle
piece.

00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:13.696 A:middle
Now you may notice there's a big

00:25:13.896 --> 00:25:15.446 A:middle
piece of this image that has got

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:17.366 A:middle
this white shading over it, what

00:25:17.366 --> 00:25:18.086 A:middle
is that all about?

00:25:18.086 --> 00:25:19.736 A:middle
Well that's actually a really

00:25:19.736 --> 00:25:21.986 A:middle
interesting thing, that part of

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:24.086 A:middle
the asset is not actually going

00:25:24.086 --> 00:25:26.106 A:middle
to be needed anymore because we

00:25:26.106 --> 00:25:27.556 A:middle
can represent any possible size

00:25:27.556 --> 00:25:28.886 A:middle
with the three remaining pieces.

00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:31.126 A:middle
Okay why is this important?

00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:33.596 A:middle
Well the nice thing is now that

00:25:33.596 --> 00:25:35.876 A:middle
Xcode knows this at build time

00:25:35.876 --> 00:25:37.866 A:middle
we can actually just take the

00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:39.066 A:middle
pieces we need and leave the

00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:40.056 A:middle
rest behind.

00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:42.306 A:middle
So that large section we don't

00:25:42.306 --> 00:25:43.126 A:middle
have to include that in the

00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:44.836 A:middle
bytes on disk that we actually

00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:46.746 A:middle
ship in your app, that's great.

00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:49.616 A:middle
And it also means that it has a

00:25:49.616 --> 00:25:50.936 A:middle
secondary benefit and this is a

00:25:50.936 --> 00:25:52.376 A:middle
more subtle one, but I really

00:25:52.376 --> 00:25:52.856 A:middle
like this.

00:25:53.366 --> 00:25:54.556 A:middle
It means that you can tell your

00:25:54.556 --> 00:25:56.376 A:middle
designer to feel totally

00:25:56.376 --> 00:25:57.956 A:middle
comfortable delivering assets at

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:00.066 A:middle
sort of their natural size and
