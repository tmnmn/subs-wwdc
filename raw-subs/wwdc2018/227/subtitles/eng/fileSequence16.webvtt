00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:01.316 A:middle
export all the variants that are

00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:02.966 A:middle
targeting all the supported

00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:06.056 A:middle
device types.

00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:08.786 A:middle
Once this is done Xcode is able

00:16:08.786 --> 00:16:11.126 A:middle
to synthesize a report that

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.446 A:middle
summarizes all the variants that

00:16:12.446 --> 00:16:13.276 A:middle
it just generated.

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:15.486 A:middle
And there are a few key data

00:16:15.486 --> 00:16:16.816 A:middle
points that you can extract from

00:16:16.816 --> 00:16:18.476 A:middle
the report to help you better

00:16:18.476 --> 00:16:19.686 A:middle
understand the deployment of

00:16:19.716 --> 00:16:21.946 A:middle
your project and again help to

00:16:21.946 --> 00:16:24.106 A:middle
answer a few key questions such

00:16:24.106 --> 00:16:25.616 A:middle
as how many variants are

00:16:25.616 --> 00:16:28.016 A:middle
generated from my project, what

00:16:28.016 --> 00:16:30.526 A:middle
do their sizes look like, and

00:16:30.526 --> 00:16:32.336 A:middle
are there any rooms left for the

00:16:32.336 --> 00:16:34.026 A:middle
optimization and fine-tuning for

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:35.186 A:middle
any particular variant.

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:39.036 A:middle
And it turns out that actually

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:40.686 A:middle
half the numbers generated for

00:16:40.686 --> 00:16:42.386 A:middle
the garage project that it just

00:16:42.386 --> 00:16:44.806 A:middle
exported and let's take a look

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:45.666 A:middle
at that.

00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:50.576 A:middle
So here on this chart it's going

00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:53.216 A:middle
to show you the sizes of all the

00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:55.226 A:middle
variants generated for a select

00:16:55.336 --> 00:16:56.636 A:middle
set of device models.

00:16:58.056 --> 00:16:59.776 A:middle
And these are the sizes

00:16:59.776 --> 00:17:01.876 A:middle
generated for the iOS 11 and
