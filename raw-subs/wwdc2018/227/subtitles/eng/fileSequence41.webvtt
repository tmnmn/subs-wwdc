00:40:59.536 --> 00:41:01.326 A:middle
on certain GPUs or not or you

00:41:01.396 --> 00:41:02.986 A:middle
put an asset that requires a

00:41:02.986 --> 00:41:05.106 A:middle
little more processing than

00:41:05.106 --> 00:41:05.526 A:middle
others.

00:41:06.136 --> 00:41:08.006 A:middle
I'd like to give two simple

00:41:08.006 --> 00:41:10.386 A:middle
examples as food for thought on

00:41:10.386 --> 00:41:11.056 A:middle
how this could work.

00:41:11.306 --> 00:41:14.076 A:middle
And the way I'm going to give

00:41:14.076 --> 00:41:15.576 A:middle
the example is by talking about

00:41:15.576 --> 00:41:16.386 A:middle
NSDataAsset.

00:41:16.936 --> 00:41:19.116 A:middle
NSDataAsset is a very simple

00:41:19.116 --> 00:41:20.216 A:middle
piece of Asset Catalog but it

00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:21.076 A:middle
can be very powerful.

00:41:21.306 --> 00:41:23.006 A:middle
All it is is a way to provide a

00:41:23.006 --> 00:41:24.306 A:middle
flexible container that you can

00:41:24.306 --> 00:41:26.256 A:middle
put in your Asset Catalog with

00:41:26.256 --> 00:41:27.786 A:middle
content variants around

00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:29.036 A:middle
arbitrary files.

00:41:29.336 --> 00:41:30.446 A:middle
This doesn't have to be an

00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:31.196 A:middle
image, it doesn't have to be a

00:41:31.196 --> 00:41:32.366 A:middle
very specific format, this can

00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:32.976 A:middle
be anything.

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:36.226 A:middle
But you can use this with Asset

00:41:36.226 --> 00:41:37.666 A:middle
Catalogs in App Thinning to

00:41:37.696 --> 00:41:39.676 A:middle
route arbitrary data to these

00:41:39.676 --> 00:41:40.806 A:middle
different performance classes.

00:41:40.876 --> 00:41:42.706 A:middle
So that's an example, consider a

00:41:42.706 --> 00:41:44.636 A:middle
cut scene video in a game.

00:41:45.676 --> 00:41:47.126 A:middle
So you might provide, have a

00:41:47.126 --> 00:41:49.096 A:middle
nice video that you put in sort

00:41:49.096 --> 00:41:49.856 A:middle
of the mid-tier of the

00:41:49.856 --> 00:41:52.246 A:middle
performance spectrum and then

00:41:52.246 --> 00:41:53.416 A:middle
you might have a really awesome

00:41:53.416 --> 00:41:55.456 A:middle
high resolution, maybe it's even

00:41:55.456 --> 00:41:57.246 A:middle
HDR who knows video that you put

00:41:57.246 --> 00:41:59.396 A:middle
in the really capable quadrants

00:41:59.396 --> 00:42:00.776 A:middle
of that capability spectrum.
