00:28:59.836 --> 00:29:00.866 A:middle
means your app might be able to

00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:02.616 A:middle
more flexibly respond to dynamic

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:06.216 A:middle
type and automatically your

00:29:06.216 --> 00:29:07.366 A:middle
images will look more crisply

00:29:07.366 --> 00:29:09.776 A:middle
when you resize your UIImage

00:29:09.776 --> 00:29:09.966 A:middle
view.

00:29:12.356 --> 00:29:13.616 A:middle
That's vector assets.

00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:16.766 A:middle
Okay next, I'd like to talk a

00:29:16.766 --> 00:29:21.726 A:middle
bit about designing for 2x, 2x

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:24.376 A:middle
commonly known as retina is the

00:29:24.376 --> 00:29:26.266 A:middle
most popular and common display

00:29:26.266 --> 00:29:27.796 A:middle
density that your apps are

00:29:27.796 --> 00:29:30.606 A:middle
probably being experienced on.

00:29:31.076 --> 00:29:33.566 A:middle
And it's great right, it was a

00:29:33.566 --> 00:29:34.976 A:middle
huge step forward, however,

00:29:35.626 --> 00:29:38.686 A:middle
there are still cases where you

00:29:38.686 --> 00:29:42.156 A:middle
can have designs where a stroke

00:29:42.156 --> 00:29:43.616 A:middle
or an edge might land on a

00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.196 A:middle
fractional pixel boundary and

00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:46.236 A:middle
result in a fuzzy edge.

00:29:46.236 --> 00:29:48.386 A:middle
It's still not high-resolution

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.256 A:middle
enough that you won't notice a

00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:50.376 A:middle
difference between a sharp edge

00:29:50.376 --> 00:29:51.046 A:middle
and a fuzzy edge.

00:29:52.256 --> 00:29:53.576 A:middle
And this can still be a

00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:56.326 A:middle
challenge in designing assets at

00:29:56.326 --> 00:29:56.786 A:middle
times.

00:29:58.376 --> 00:30:00.426 A:middle
Well what are some techniques
