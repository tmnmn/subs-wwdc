00:30:58.676 --> 00:31:01.066 A:middle
And then adjust your assets and

00:31:01.066 --> 00:31:03.556 A:middle
use the point snapping to adjust

00:31:03.556 --> 00:31:05.336 A:middle
your strokes and edges to fit

00:31:05.406 --> 00:31:05.656 A:middle
there.

00:31:06.256 --> 00:31:08.686 A:middle
Okay that's great, now what do

00:31:08.686 --> 00:31:09.556 A:middle
you do with this thing once

00:31:09.556 --> 00:31:10.996 A:middle
you've got it, it's too big

00:31:10.996 --> 00:31:11.716 A:middle
right, it doesn't work?

00:31:12.286 --> 00:31:14.496 A:middle
Yes it does, all you have to do

00:31:14.496 --> 00:31:16.196 A:middle
is just drop it into the 2x slot

00:31:16.476 --> 00:31:18.936 A:middle
in the Asset Catalog scales bins

00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:20.716 A:middle
and that will automatically

00:31:20.716 --> 00:31:22.686 A:middle
enable Xcode to process that

00:31:22.686 --> 00:31:24.266 A:middle
artwork, realize it's actually a

00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:25.956 A:middle
2x piece of artwork, it's

00:31:25.956 --> 00:31:27.246 A:middle
slightly too big, one point is

00:31:27.246 --> 00:31:29.256 A:middle
not equal to two pixels of

00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.816 A:middle
retina, but rather the other way

00:31:30.816 --> 00:31:31.146 A:middle
around.

00:31:31.386 --> 00:31:32.746 A:middle
We'll do all the math, we'll

00:31:32.746 --> 00:31:34.776 A:middle
render all the right rasterized

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:35.826 A:middle
bitmaps for all the other scale

00:31:35.826 --> 00:31:37.926 A:middle
factors and handle that for you.

00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:40.106 A:middle
Freeing the designer to use that

00:31:40.106 --> 00:31:41.626 A:middle
2x grid which can be rather

00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:41.986 A:middle
helpful.

00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:45.656 A:middle
Of course, if the automatic

00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:46.506 A:middle
scaling that we do is

00:31:46.506 --> 00:31:47.726 A:middle
insufficient or still presents

00:31:47.796 --> 00:31:50.756 A:middle
problems in some areas, you can

00:31:50.756 --> 00:31:52.276 A:middle
have ultimate control of your

00:31:52.276 --> 00:31:54.366 A:middle
results as always by dropping in

00:31:54.366 --> 00:31:55.696 A:middle
hinted bitmaps into the

00:31:55.696 --> 00:31:56.956 A:middle
appropriate scale factor bins

00:31:57.116 --> 00:31:58.586 A:middle
and we'll go ahead and use that

00:31:58.586 --> 00:31:59.726 A:middle
and prefer that over the

00:31:59.976 --> 00:32:02.656 A:middle
generated PDF rasterizations.
