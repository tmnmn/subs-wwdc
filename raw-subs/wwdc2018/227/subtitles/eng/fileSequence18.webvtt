00:18:02.506 --> 00:18:03.766 A:middle
So that's great, so you just

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.486 A:middle
heard about some amazing ways

00:18:05.486 --> 00:18:07.106 A:middle
that you can get your assets

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:08.606 A:middle
improved just by using Asset

00:18:08.606 --> 00:18:09.746 A:middle
Catalogs in Xcode.

00:18:09.746 --> 00:18:11.866 A:middle
I'm going to talk a little bit

00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:13.296 A:middle
more about a few other things

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:14.166 A:middle
that you can do with just a

00:18:14.166 --> 00:18:15.116 A:middle
little bit of effort in Asset

00:18:15.116 --> 00:18:17.366 A:middle
Catalogs to really optimize your

00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:18.726 A:middle
application's assets.

00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:21.966 A:middle
So and I'd like to begin with

00:18:22.096 --> 00:18:23.496 A:middle
design and production because

00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:24.826 A:middle
this is really where it all

00:18:24.826 --> 00:18:25.326 A:middle
begins.

00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:29.986 A:middle
So assets as you know they come

00:18:29.986 --> 00:18:31.446 A:middle
from many tools, many different

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:32.726 A:middle
workflows, many different

00:18:32.726 --> 00:18:34.516 A:middle
sources but they have one thing

00:18:34.516 --> 00:18:35.806 A:middle
in common, they ultimately all

00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:37.206 A:middle
came from humans at some point.

00:18:38.146 --> 00:18:39.446 A:middle
And it really pays to be

00:18:39.446 --> 00:18:41.056 A:middle
organized in terms of

00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:43.086 A:middle
understanding that process of

00:18:43.086 --> 00:18:44.376 A:middle
how those assets come into your

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:46.386 A:middle
software workflow and to pay

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:47.086 A:middle
attention to some of those

00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:48.306 A:middle
details that can really pay big

00:18:48.306 --> 00:18:50.376 A:middle
dividends in your application

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:50.886 A:middle
efficacy.

00:18:51.636 --> 00:18:54.796 A:middle
So the topic I'd like to talk

00:18:54.796 --> 00:18:56.746 A:middle
about first is color management,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.606 A:middle
often overlooked but still quite

00:18:58.606 --> 00:18:59.116 A:middle
essential.
