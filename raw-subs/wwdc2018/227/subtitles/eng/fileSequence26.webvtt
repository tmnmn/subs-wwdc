00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:00.066 A:middle
sort of their natural size and

00:26:00.066 --> 00:26:00.946 A:middle
don't have to worry about

00:26:01.006 --> 00:26:02.136 A:middle
pre-optimizing them to be the

00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:03.846 A:middle
smallest possible things so that

00:26:03.946 --> 00:26:05.966 A:middle
it's efficiently deployed right.

00:26:06.236 --> 00:26:07.346 A:middle
That shouldn't be the concern of

00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:08.256 A:middle
the designer it's actually much

00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:08.996 A:middle
more meaningful over the

00:26:08.996 --> 00:26:10.876 A:middle
long-term to put something in

00:26:10.876 --> 00:26:12.196 A:middle
the source code that's easy to

00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:13.946 A:middle
look at and obvious what it is

00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:15.836 A:middle
and let the tools worry about

00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:16.946 A:middle
these deployment details.

00:26:18.046 --> 00:26:20.066 A:middle
So in addition to the graphical

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.506 A:middle
inspector and graphical way of

00:26:21.506 --> 00:26:22.556 A:middle
identifying the stretchable

00:26:22.556 --> 00:26:24.076 A:middle
portion there is of course also

00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:25.636 A:middle
the Show Slicing Inspector which

00:26:25.636 --> 00:26:27.006 A:middle
where you can have fine control

00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:29.396 A:middle
over these edge insets and also

00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:31.696 A:middle
control the behavior of the

00:26:31.696 --> 00:26:33.286 A:middle
centerpiece when it stretches or

00:26:33.286 --> 00:26:33.846 A:middle
tiles.

00:26:36.206 --> 00:26:38.106 A:middle
All this of course adds up to

00:26:38.106 --> 00:26:39.376 A:middle
keeping the stretching metadata

00:26:39.376 --> 00:26:41.166 A:middle
close to the artwork which will

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.976 A:middle
then yield enormous benefits the

00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:44.446 A:middle
next time, which inevitably

00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:46.026 A:middle
happens, the designer comes up

00:26:46.026 --> 00:26:47.086 A:middle
with a new update to your

00:26:47.086 --> 00:26:47.536 A:middle
design.

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:49.716 A:middle
Now you can update everything in

00:26:49.716 --> 00:26:50.866 A:middle
one place and don't have to

00:26:50.866 --> 00:26:52.286 A:middle
remember the five or six places

00:26:52.286 --> 00:26:53.406 A:middle
in code where you might have a

00:26:53.406 --> 00:26:54.736 A:middle
hang code of the edge insets

00:26:54.776 --> 00:26:57.196 A:middle
previously, now it's all tied

00:26:57.196 --> 00:26:58.336 A:middle
together in one place.

00:26:58.706 --> 00:27:00.976 A:middle
Thank you.
