00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
getting any given image or

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:02.006 A:middle
texture asset.

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:04.906 A:middle
While that may be sufficient for

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:07.036 A:middle
most projects, it's still a good

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:08.886 A:middle
idea to understand what are some

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.936 A:middle
of the options offered and more

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:12.766 A:middle
importantly, to understand what

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.536 A:middle
are their trade-offs, as well as

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.676 A:middle
what are the implications on

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:16.266 A:middle
your project.

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:20.726 A:middle
Now before I dive into the

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:22.536 A:middle
specifics of any image

00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:24.396 A:middle
compression, I'd like to talk a

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:25.586 A:middle
little bit about another

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:27.946 A:middle
optimization in Asset Catalog

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.186 A:middle
that has a huge implication on

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.256 A:middle
all of the compression that we

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:33.426 A:middle
do, and it's called automatic

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:34.196 A:middle
image packing.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.506 A:middle
Traditionally, before the

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:41.896 A:middle
inception of Asset Catalog, one

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.606 A:middle
way to deploy assets in your

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:45.126 A:middle
application is just to dump a

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:46.686 A:middle
bunch of image files in the

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:47.596 A:middle
application [inaudible] of your

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:48.076 A:middle
project.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.206 A:middle
It's important to be aware that

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.626 A:middle
there are many drawbacks, as

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:54.416 A:middle
well as trade-offs when doing

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:55.136 A:middle
this approach.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:58.956 A:middle
There are two sides of downsize

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
that you have to be aware of.
