amount of I/O and memory to load

00:45:00.016 --> 00:45:00.866 A:middle
all those images.

00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:02.286 A:middle
So please be sure that you're

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:03.996 A:middle
about to use them right away and

00:45:03.996 --> 00:45:04.956 A:middle
that it's the right choice,

00:45:05.376 --> 00:45:07.296 A:middle
otherwise a jetsam awaits you.

00:45:09.836 --> 00:45:12.316 A:middle
So another powerful thing about

00:45:12.316 --> 00:45:14.976 A:middle
Sprite atlases is that any image

00:45:14.976 --> 00:45:17.426 A:middle
within the Sprite atlas has all

00:45:17.426 --> 00:45:18.776 A:middle
of the regular features of any

00:45:18.776 --> 00:45:20.076 A:middle
other normal image set within

00:45:20.236 --> 00:45:21.766 A:middle
code Asset Catalogs, including

00:45:21.766 --> 00:45:23.856 A:middle
all the cataloging features, all

00:45:23.856 --> 00:45:26.066 A:middle
the compression settings, and

00:45:26.426 --> 00:45:27.706 A:middle
all the App Thinning features.

00:45:27.846 --> 00:45:28.756 A:middle
We will take care to

00:45:28.806 --> 00:45:30.546 A:middle
automatically split and collate

00:45:30.546 --> 00:45:31.456 A:middle
all of the images that you

00:45:31.456 --> 00:45:33.746 A:middle
provide appropriately, split

00:45:33.746 --> 00:45:34.966 A:middle
them by pixel formats, by

00:45:34.966 --> 00:45:36.186 A:middle
different device traits, and

00:45:36.186 --> 00:45:37.156 A:middle
different compression types.

00:45:37.426 --> 00:45:38.376 A:middle
And make sure everything gets

00:45:38.426 --> 00:45:39.456 A:middle
baked appropriately and then

00:45:39.456 --> 00:45:40.636 A:middle
thinned appropriately so that

00:45:40.636 --> 00:45:42.086 A:middle
the data gets routed to the

00:45:42.086 --> 00:45:46.796 A:middle
right device in the right way.

00:45:47.006 --> 00:45:48.076 A:middle
So those are some interesting

00:45:48.076 --> 00:45:49.746 A:middle
details about deployment, we're

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:50.686 A:middle
in the homestretch here.

00:45:51.396 --> 00:45:52.846 A:middle
So I'd like to remind you of the

00:45:52.846 --> 00:45:53.636 A:middle
important things about

00:45:53.636 --> 00:45:54.926 A:middle
optimizing app assets here.

00:45:54.926 --> 00:45:56.666 A:middle
First and foremost, I think

00:45:57.216 --> 00:45:58.926 A:middle
Xcode Asset Catalogs are really

00:45:58.926 --> 00:46:00.146 A:middle
the best choice for managing the
