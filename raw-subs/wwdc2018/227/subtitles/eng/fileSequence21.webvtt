A related topic I'd like to talk

00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:03.886 A:middle
about here is working space.

00:21:05.316 --> 00:21:06.816 A:middle
Now by working space I'm really

00:21:06.816 --> 00:21:08.506 A:middle
referring to the environment in

00:21:08.506 --> 00:21:09.746 A:middle
which these assets actually got

00:21:09.746 --> 00:21:10.826 A:middle
originated in the first place,

00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:13.226 A:middle
this is the designer or maybe as

00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:14.796 A:middle
an engineer are working on some

00:21:14.796 --> 00:21:16.276 A:middle
artwork yourself, you're working

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.596 A:middle
in a design tool, you're

00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:18.586 A:middle
creating content.

00:21:19.106 --> 00:21:21.476 A:middle
It's important in these contexts

00:21:21.476 --> 00:21:23.076 A:middle
to use consistent color settings

00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:24.196 A:middle
for all the design files that

00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:25.206 A:middle
you have for your project.

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:27.346 A:middle
This actually is a good practice

00:21:27.346 --> 00:21:28.606 A:middle
and it actually has positive

00:21:28.606 --> 00:21:30.086 A:middle
technical benefits because it

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:32.296 A:middle
ensures a consistency between

00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:35.176 A:middle
how you organize everything

00:21:35.176 --> 00:21:37.956 A:middle
across your application.

00:21:38.726 --> 00:21:40.836 A:middle
There are two specific formats

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:42.576 A:middle
that are most talked about and

00:21:42.576 --> 00:21:44.726 A:middle
most recommended for creating

00:21:44.726 --> 00:21:45.686 A:middle
working design files.

00:21:46.136 --> 00:21:49.046 A:middle
sRGB 8 bits is by far the most

00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:50.506 A:middle
common, a very popular choice

00:21:50.506 --> 00:21:51.406 A:middle
and it has broadest

00:21:51.406 --> 00:21:52.686 A:middle
applicability across all of our

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.166 A:middle
devices and your content types

00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:55.386 A:middle
really.

00:21:56.216 --> 00:21:58.136 A:middle
However, if you're working on a

00:21:58.136 --> 00:22:00.006 A:middle
really killer take it up to the
