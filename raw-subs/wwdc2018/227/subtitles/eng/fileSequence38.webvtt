00:37:59.436 --> 00:38:00.956 A:middle
is graphics classes.

00:38:00.956 --> 00:38:02.826 A:middle
Now these actually correspond to

00:38:02.826 --> 00:38:03.586 A:middle
two things.

00:38:04.056 --> 00:38:06.536 A:middle
One, they correspond to Metal

00:38:06.536 --> 00:38:08.176 A:middle
feature family sets, which if

00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:09.066 A:middle
you're a Metal programmer you

00:38:09.066 --> 00:38:10.056 A:middle
may be familiar with, this is

00:38:10.056 --> 00:38:11.326 A:middle
the GPU family concept.

00:38:11.886 --> 00:38:13.116 A:middle
But they actually correspond

00:38:13.116 --> 00:38:15.096 A:middle
also exactly with a particular

00:38:15.396 --> 00:38:17.216 A:middle
processor revision in your

00:38:17.216 --> 00:38:17.656 A:middle
device.

00:38:18.326 --> 00:38:20.506 A:middle
So Metal 1 corresponds to Apple

00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:22.766 A:middle
A7 all the way through Metal 4

00:38:22.766 --> 00:38:24.236 A:middle
which is the Apple A11

00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:24.806 A:middle
processor.

00:38:25.376 --> 00:38:27.536 A:middle
And we allow you to catalog and

00:38:27.536 --> 00:38:29.526 A:middle
route assets to each of these

00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:31.506 A:middle
particular graphics classes.

00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:34.356 A:middle
That can be pretty powerful by

00:38:34.356 --> 00:38:36.186 A:middle
itself either one of those, but

00:38:36.336 --> 00:38:38.046 A:middle
where it gets really interesting

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:40.756 A:middle
is when you can combine these

00:38:40.756 --> 00:38:42.436 A:middle
two traits together to form a

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:44.416 A:middle
full capability matrix that you

00:38:44.416 --> 00:38:46.346 A:middle
can really finally calibrate how

00:38:46.346 --> 00:38:47.906 A:middle
you want to adapt your assets to

00:38:48.176 --> 00:38:49.616 A:middle
this hardware landscape.

00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:53.146 A:middle
Now how does this work?

00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:56.326 A:middle
I'd like to explain this to you

00:38:56.326 --> 00:38:57.566 A:middle
by walking through a simple

00:38:57.566 --> 00:38:58.886 A:middle
example and this is really key

00:38:58.886 --> 00:39:00.206 A:middle
to understand how we do things,
