00:14:59.146 --> 00:15:00.436 A:middle
all you have to do is go to

00:15:00.506 --> 00:15:02.816 A:middle
Xcode archive button.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.746 A:middle
This will simply instruct Xcode

00:15:05.966 --> 00:15:08.576 A:middle
to generate all variants of your

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:09.616 A:middle
project.

00:15:10.436 --> 00:15:12.536 A:middle
Once that is done simply click

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:15.106 A:middle
on the Organizer button and that

00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:17.106 A:middle
will bring up a window that

00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:18.496 A:middle
shows all the variants generated

00:15:18.656 --> 00:15:19.356 A:middle
for your project.

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:23.936 A:middle
And here's a window for the

00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:25.836 A:middle
garage band project that we took

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:27.546 A:middle
to perform this exercise.

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:30.556 A:middle
The first thing that Xcode is

00:15:30.556 --> 00:15:32.626 A:middle
going to ask is to select a type

00:15:32.626 --> 00:15:34.976 A:middle
of distribution method that you

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.196 A:middle
can distribute all the variants

00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:37.176 A:middle
that it just generated.

00:15:38.596 --> 00:15:39.676 A:middle
For the purpose of this

00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:42.086 A:middle
exercise, simply select Ad Hoc

00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:43.016 A:middle
Distribution.

00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:49.086 A:middle
And on the next window, in the

00:15:49.086 --> 00:15:51.656 A:middle
App Thinning field, simply

00:15:51.656 --> 00:15:54.406 A:middle
select all compatible device

00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:54.956 A:middle
variants.

00:15:56.196 --> 00:15:58.446 A:middle
This will instruct Xcode to

00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:01.316 A:middle
export all the variants that are
