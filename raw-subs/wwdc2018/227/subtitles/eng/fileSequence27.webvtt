00:26:58.706 --> 00:27:00.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:04.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:05.076 --> 00:27:06.166 A:middle
Okay next up I'd like to talk

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.166 A:middle
about vector assets.

00:27:08.046 --> 00:27:10.866 A:middle
So because our displays on all

00:27:10.866 --> 00:27:12.586 A:middle
of our products have a variety

00:27:12.586 --> 00:27:13.656 A:middle
of different resolutions you're

00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:15.016 A:middle
probably very used to delivering

00:27:15.016 --> 00:27:17.156 A:middle
1x, 2x, 3x depending on what

00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:18.196 A:middle
platform you're targeting,

00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:19.526 A:middle
distinct assets.

00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:21.326 A:middle
And that's fine and works really

00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:23.646 A:middle
well, but it's kind of a mess to

00:27:23.646 --> 00:27:25.196 A:middle
have to deliver three or two or

00:27:25.196 --> 00:27:26.486 A:middle
three assets every time for a

00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:28.516 A:middle
single design for no other

00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:29.526 A:middle
reason than just resolution.

00:27:30.886 --> 00:27:32.296 A:middle
What if you can actually get

00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:33.816 A:middle
away with this with just one

00:27:33.816 --> 00:27:34.106 A:middle
asset?

00:27:34.106 --> 00:27:35.196 A:middle
Well you can and we've been

00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:36.396 A:middle
supporting vector assets in

00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:37.556 A:middle
Asset Catalogs for a number of

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:39.236 A:middle
years now in the PDF format.

00:27:39.886 --> 00:27:42.806 A:middle
And with Xcode Asset Catalogs

00:27:43.746 --> 00:27:45.876 A:middle
you can actually supply a PDF

00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:48.656 A:middle
and Xcode will generate and

00:27:48.656 --> 00:27:50.926 A:middle
rasterize that PDF into all of

00:27:50.926 --> 00:27:52.496 A:middle
the applicable scale factors

00:27:53.286 --> 00:27:54.426 A:middle
that your app is currently

00:27:54.426 --> 00:27:55.796 A:middle
targeting depending on platform.

00:27:56.486 --> 00:27:58.196 A:middle
And that's really great because

00:27:58.196 --> 00:27:59.596 A:middle
it means you don't have to worry

00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:02.086 A:middle
about paying any cost at runtime
