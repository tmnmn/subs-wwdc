00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
that you have to be aware of.

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:01.966 A:middle
The first comes from the

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:03.476 A:middle
additional disk storage that

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:05.656 A:middle
comes with doing so.

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:08.876 A:middle
Traditional image container

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.796 A:middle
formats uses extra space to

00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:13.376 A:middle
store metadata, as well as other

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.516 A:middle
attributes associated with the

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:16.396 A:middle
underlying image.

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:18.876 A:middle
Now if your application has a

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:21.006 A:middle
huge number of assets, and if

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:23.366 A:middle
they have similar metadata, the

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.016 A:middle
same information gets duplicated

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:26.796 A:middle
over and over on disk for no

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:27.466 A:middle
real benefit.

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.276 A:middle
Additionally, if most of your

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.636 A:middle
assets are fairly small then you

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:35.026 A:middle
do not get the full benefit of

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:36.236 A:middle
most image compression.

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:40.486 A:middle
The other type of drawback comes

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.726 A:middle
mainly from the organizational

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:43.086 A:middle
overhead that you have to pay

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:43.396 A:middle
for.

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:45.826 A:middle
It is very hard work with a

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.626 A:middle
large cache of loose image files

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.636 A:middle
and it's also much harder to

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:52.096 A:middle
interact with them from the

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.986 A:middle
NSImage and UIImage family of

00:03:53.986 --> 00:03:54.476 A:middle
APIs.

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:57.526 A:middle
Last but not least, you also

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:58.176 A:middle
have to deal with the

00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:00.416 A:middle
inconsistency in image format,
