00:38:58.886 --> 00:39:00.206 A:middle
to understand how we do things,

00:39:00.206 --> 00:39:01.656 A:middle
it helps you understand how you

00:39:01.656 --> 00:39:02.576 A:middle
might be able to use it.

00:39:03.206 --> 00:39:04.746 A:middle
So in this example, we've

00:39:04.856 --> 00:39:05.906 A:middle
provided three specialized

00:39:05.906 --> 00:39:07.426 A:middle
assets, one any any which is

00:39:07.426 --> 00:39:09.276 A:middle
just the backstop for the lower

00:39:09.276 --> 00:39:11.026 A:middle
capability devices.

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:12.296 A:middle
And then we provide two

00:39:12.296 --> 00:39:14.506 A:middle
optimized assets, one for 3 GB

00:39:14.506 --> 00:39:16.376 A:middle
devices with Metal 3 or better

00:39:16.836 --> 00:39:19.036 A:middle
and one for 2 GB devices with

00:39:19.036 --> 00:39:19.546 A:middle
Metal 4.

00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:22.866 A:middle
So let's imagine that I'm

00:39:22.866 --> 00:39:24.046 A:middle
selecting the asset from the

00:39:24.046 --> 00:39:25.806 A:middle
context or the viewpoint of an

00:39:25.926 --> 00:39:27.006 A:middle
iPhone 8 Plus.

00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:29.686 A:middle
So I'm 4 GB, Metal 4, that's

00:39:29.686 --> 00:39:31.656 A:middle
where I'm starting and I'm

00:39:31.656 --> 00:39:33.696 A:middle
searching, I'm finding nothing

00:39:33.726 --> 00:39:35.046 A:middle
in 4 GB memory tier.

00:39:36.136 --> 00:39:38.926 A:middle
So next, I'm going to go drop

00:39:38.926 --> 00:39:40.726 A:middle
down a memory tier and look for

00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:42.236 A:middle
anything that can be found in 3

00:39:42.236 --> 00:39:42.996 A:middle
GB memory tier.

00:39:44.486 --> 00:39:46.586 A:middle
I do that and I find this asset

00:39:46.586 --> 00:39:49.306 A:middle
here and I'm going to select

00:39:49.306 --> 00:39:49.506 A:middle
that.

00:39:49.746 --> 00:39:52.316 A:middle
Now what's important here is

00:39:52.316 --> 00:39:54.336 A:middle
that I have selected this asset

00:39:54.556 --> 00:39:56.936 A:middle
at 3 gigabyte Metal 3 even

00:39:56.936 --> 00:39:58.436 A:middle
though there is an asset that

00:39:58.436 --> 00:40:00.206 A:middle
actually matches exactly to my
