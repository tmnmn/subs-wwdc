00:36:59.786 --> 00:37:00.736 A:middle
with Asset Catalogs.

00:37:01.536 --> 00:37:03.246 A:middle
There's such a broad range of

00:37:03.246 --> 00:37:04.736 A:middle
hardware capabilities between

00:37:04.736 --> 00:37:06.406 A:middle
the supported devices that we

00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:07.816 A:middle
have, even if you go back a few

00:37:07.816 --> 00:37:09.906 A:middle
iOS, I mean all the way from say

00:37:09.906 --> 00:37:11.586 A:middle
an iPhone 5 up to the latest

00:37:11.586 --> 00:37:13.636 A:middle
iPhone 10, that's a huge range

00:37:13.636 --> 00:37:14.796 A:middle
of performance capability.

00:37:15.706 --> 00:37:16.716 A:middle
Wouldn't it be nice to take

00:37:16.716 --> 00:37:19.246 A:middle
advantage of that and avoid the

00:37:19.326 --> 00:37:21.296 A:middle
needing to constrain your app to

00:37:21.296 --> 00:37:22.996 A:middle
the least capable device that

00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:24.006 A:middle
your application needs to

00:37:24.006 --> 00:37:24.436 A:middle
support?

00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:26.766 A:middle
That's the goal here to be able

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.986 A:middle
to have your cake and eat it too

00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:30.536 A:middle
and to do that you can solve it

00:37:30.536 --> 00:37:31.796 A:middle
with adaptive resources.

00:37:32.176 --> 00:37:33.316 A:middle
I'm going to tell you how now.

00:37:34.636 --> 00:37:36.616 A:middle
So there are two main ways that

00:37:36.616 --> 00:37:37.616 A:middle
we divide the performance

00:37:37.616 --> 00:37:38.116 A:middle
continuum.

00:37:38.116 --> 00:37:39.756 A:middle
The first is memory classes and

00:37:39.756 --> 00:37:40.736 A:middle
this is perhaps the most

00:37:40.736 --> 00:37:41.416 A:middle
important one.

00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:43.556 A:middle
We have four memory tiers, 1 GB

00:37:43.556 --> 00:37:45.526 A:middle
through 4 GB and that

00:37:45.526 --> 00:37:46.836 A:middle
corresponds to the installed

00:37:46.836 --> 00:37:48.956 A:middle
memory on the various devices

00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:50.026 A:middle
and again this is across our

00:37:50.026 --> 00:37:51.536 A:middle
entire product mix, it doesn't

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:53.266 A:middle
matter what it is, it's in one

00:37:53.266 --> 00:37:53.786 A:middle
of these bins.

00:37:55.686 --> 00:37:59.086 A:middle
The second access of collection

00:37:59.436 --> 00:38:00.956 A:middle
is graphics classes.
