00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.196 A:middle
of your apps as well and that is

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:02.336 A:middle
why we're here today to showcase

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:03.496 A:middle
some of the best practices with

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.266 A:middle
Asset Catalog and also more

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.926 A:middle
importantly, on how you can

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:08.876 A:middle
better deploy the assets in your

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:10.496 A:middle
application to your users and

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:11.726 A:middle
how to translate that to the

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:13.056 A:middle
overall user experience.

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:17.546 A:middle
And throughout this talk we're

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:19.106 A:middle
going to touch on a variety of

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:21.046 A:middle
different aspects through the

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:22.906 A:middle
traditional, design, develop,

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:24.156 A:middle
and deployment workflow.

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:26.676 A:middle
But first I'd like to spend a

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:28.696 A:middle
little bit of time to talk about

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:31.106 A:middle
a topic and that is image

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:31.686 A:middle
compression.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:35.936 A:middle
Image compression is at the

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.106 A:middle
heart of the Asset Catalog

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:40.776 A:middle
editor and is the last step in

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:41.966 A:middle
the Asset Catalog compilation

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:42.516 A:middle
pipeline.

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:44.886 A:middle
And is greatly related to some

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:46.346 A:middle
of the other optimizations that

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.536 A:middle
happen throughout the pipeline.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.896 A:middle
By default Asset Catalog offers

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:54.356 A:middle
a variety of different types of

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:56.706 A:middle
compression types and is also by

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:58.346 A:middle
default able to select the most

00:01:58.346 --> 00:01:59.826 A:middle
optimal compression type for

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
getting any given image or
