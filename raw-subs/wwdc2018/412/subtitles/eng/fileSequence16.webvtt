00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:01.766 A:middle
And then, what I'd like to do,

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:03.856 A:middle
rather than recompile and rerun

00:16:03.856 --> 00:16:05.936 A:middle
to test this change, I'd like to

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.336 A:middle
actually test this change in the

00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:09.416 A:middle
context of the current running

00:16:09.416 --> 00:16:10.606 A:middle
application like before.

00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:12.086 A:middle
So I'm going to add a breakpoint

00:16:12.086 --> 00:16:13.276 A:middle
below the current line because

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:14.286 A:middle
remember, we've changed the code

00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:15.536 A:middle
but we haven't recompiled.

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:17.076 A:middle
So while the label will still be

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.226 A:middle
set, we'll add our line below

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:20.366 A:middle
that to set it to the value we

00:16:20.366 --> 00:16:21.046 A:middle
think it should be.

00:16:21.476 --> 00:16:22.906 A:middle
So another custom breakpoint,

00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:24.746 A:middle
and we can use expression once

00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:27.346 A:middle
again to inject that code and

00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:28.566 A:middle
make this auto-continuing.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.856 A:middle
So now, if I press continue,

00:16:30.986 --> 00:16:32.846 A:middle
code execution will continue to

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:34.406 A:middle
flow through here, and we see

00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:35.446 A:middle
that the attempts label is

00:16:35.446 --> 00:16:36.236 A:middle
indeed updated.

00:16:36.546 --> 00:16:38.196 A:middle
I'd like to make sure that also

00:16:38.196 --> 00:16:38.676 A:middle
works.

00:16:38.676 --> 00:16:39.226 A:middle
Well, thank you.

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:43.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:45.826 A:middle
I'd like to make sure that also

00:16:45.826 --> 00:16:47.676 A:middle
works for the score label after

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:49.546 A:middle
a successful jump, so let's

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:51.296 A:middle
navigate back to here.

00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:53.606 A:middle
I can remove this jump-completed

00:16:53.706 --> 00:16:54.916 A:middle
breakpoint that was creating the

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.016 A:middle
one shot breakpoint because we

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.916 A:middle
don't need that anymore.

00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:59.026 A:middle
And I can disable the breakpoint

00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:00.626 A:middle
in jump because we don't want to
