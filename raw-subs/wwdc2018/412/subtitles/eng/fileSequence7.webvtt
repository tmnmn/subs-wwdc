00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:00.626 A:middle
I'd like this to happen every

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:02.176 A:middle
time I tap on the astronaut, and

00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:03.696 A:middle
I don't want to have to pause

00:07:03.696 --> 00:07:04.916 A:middle
and type this expression each

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:06.336 A:middle
time, so what I'm going to do is

00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:08.046 A:middle
configure this breakpoint to do

00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:08.596 A:middle
that for me.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:10.156 A:middle
If I right click on the

00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:12.216 A:middle
breakpoint, I can select edit

00:07:12.216 --> 00:07:13.676 A:middle
breakpoint and this gives me a

00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:15.616 A:middle
popover window with some

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:17.346 A:middle
configuration to customize how

00:07:17.346 --> 00:07:18.486 A:middle
the breakpoint behaves.

00:07:18.486 --> 00:07:20.186 A:middle
I'm going to select the debugger

00:07:20.186 --> 00:07:22.686 A:middle
command action and enter the

00:07:22.686 --> 00:07:24.366 A:middle
expression command with the

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:26.226 A:middle
command that I used in the debug

00:07:26.226 --> 00:07:28.696 A:middle
console and make this an

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:30.016 A:middle
auto-continuing breakpoint.

00:07:30.326 --> 00:07:31.596 A:middle
So what we've configured here is

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:33.066 A:middle
a breakpoint that once execution

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:34.136 A:middle
enters this function, the

00:07:34.136 --> 00:07:35.956 A:middle
breakpoint will trigger execute

00:07:35.996 --> 00:07:37.216 A:middle
this command for us to change

00:07:37.216 --> 00:07:38.156 A:middle
the value of the property and

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:39.306 A:middle
then automatically continue.

00:07:40.006 --> 00:07:40.986 A:middle
So now, every time I tap the

00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:42.556 A:middle
astronaut, he'll perform this

00:07:42.626 --> 00:07:44.226 A:middle
unsuccessful jump and fall back

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:44.506 A:middle
down.

00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:46.146 A:middle
Now what's the problem that we

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:47.136 A:middle
need to fix?

00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:48.576 A:middle
The specification said that

00:07:48.576 --> 00:07:49.446 A:middle
after falling down, the

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:50.806 A:middle
astronaut should stand back up

00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:52.486 A:middle
again, so let's fix that now.

00:07:53.196 --> 00:07:55.486 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to this

00:07:55.486 --> 00:07:56.976 A:middle
function update UI for jump

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.576 A:middle
failed, and we can see this

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.256 A:middle
function uses UIKit Dynamics to
