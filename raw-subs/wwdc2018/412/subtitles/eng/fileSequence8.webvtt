00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.256 A:middle
function uses UIKit Dynamics to

00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:02.216 A:middle
simulate failing the jump.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:04.916 A:middle
So it starts by creating a UI

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:06.756 A:middle
Dynamic animator and then calls

00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:07.976 A:middle
a function to add behaviors to

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:09.056 A:middle
create the physics effects.

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:10.766 A:middle
And then the astronaut is meant

00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:12.756 A:middle
to be reoriented and recentered

00:08:13.036 --> 00:08:14.866 A:middle
in the dynamic animator did

00:08:15.106 --> 00:08:17.016 A:middle
pause delegate callback.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:18.546 A:middle
Now we can scroll down and see

00:08:18.546 --> 00:08:20.016 A:middle
that that delegate callback is

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:21.686 A:middle
implemented successfully, so

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:22.336 A:middle
that looks fine.

00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:23.856 A:middle
But I'm noticing that no

00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:25.516 A:middle
delegate is set on this object,

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:28.956 A:middle
so if I add that code in here, I

00:08:28.956 --> 00:08:30.016 A:middle
think this is the change I'll

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:31.016 A:middle
need to fix the problem.

00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:32.676 A:middle
Now, at this point, I can

00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:34.806 A:middle
recompile and rerun and try and

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.866 A:middle
verify my fix, but I'd like to

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:38.275 A:middle
shortcut that whole cycle if I

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:38.556 A:middle
can.

00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:40.476 A:middle
So what I'm going to do is use a

00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:41.986 A:middle
breakpoint to inject this change

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:43.806 A:middle
for me so I can see if this does

00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:45.486 A:middle
fix the problem quickly and

00:08:45.486 --> 00:08:46.066 A:middle
conveniently.

00:08:46.586 --> 00:08:47.556 A:middle
So I'll create a break point,

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:49.956 A:middle
double click to bring up the

00:08:49.956 --> 00:08:51.836 A:middle
edit window, which is a shortcut

00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:52.976 A:middle
for bringing up the edit window.

00:08:52.976 --> 00:08:54.636 A:middle
And then, once again, use a

00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:55.846 A:middle
debugger command action to

00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:57.576 A:middle
inject an expression, and I can

00:08:57.576 --> 00:08:59.696 A:middle
type in that line of code that I

00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:01.396 A:middle
think will fix the problem and
