00:31:00.156 --> 00:31:01.326 A:middle
I'm going to copy command script

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:02.896 A:middle
import so we can just paste it

00:31:02.896 --> 00:31:04.886 A:middle
in to the debug session to save

00:31:04.886 --> 00:31:06.026 A:middle
us restarting that session.

00:31:06.266 --> 00:31:07.406 A:middle
And now we have a command called

00:31:07.406 --> 00:31:07.776 A:middle
nudge.

00:31:08.256 --> 00:31:10.586 A:middle
So I can, let's say, nudge zero

00:31:10.626 --> 00:31:11.986 A:middle
horizontally, minus five

00:31:11.986 --> 00:31:13.606 A:middle
vertically, give it the memory

00:31:13.606 --> 00:31:15.516 A:middle
address of that view and start

00:31:15.516 --> 00:31:17.076 A:middle
just nudging it around in the

00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:17.886 A:middle
simulator.

00:31:18.516 --> 00:31:26.306 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:26.806 --> 00:31:28.176 A:middle
The great thing about LLDB is if

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:29.746 A:middle
you just hit enter on a blank

00:31:29.746 --> 00:31:30.856 A:middle
line, it repeats the previous

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:32.006 A:middle
line, so it's great for nudging.

00:31:32.736 --> 00:31:34.446 A:middle
And I can nudge it across to the

00:31:34.446 --> 00:31:35.776 A:middle
right a bit, just to get it

00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:36.136 A:middle
right.

00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:37.966 A:middle
And then let's do the other

00:31:37.966 --> 00:31:38.326 A:middle
view.

00:31:38.326 --> 00:31:41.346 A:middle
We can give it any view

00:31:41.346 --> 00:31:43.096 A:middle
expression, say the attempts

00:31:43.096 --> 00:31:44.026 A:middle
view down to here.

00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:45.606 A:middle
The other feature of nudge is

00:31:45.606 --> 00:31:46.566 A:middle
once you've given it a view

00:31:46.566 --> 00:31:47.826 A:middle
expression, you don't have to

00:31:47.856 --> 00:31:48.816 A:middle
repeat that expression.

00:31:49.436 --> 00:31:51.756 A:middle
It remembers that and applies it

00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:53.886 A:middle
to the same view that you've

00:31:53.886 --> 00:31:54.686 A:middle
specified previously.

00:31:54.686 --> 00:31:55.546 A:middle
So something like that looks

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:55.866 A:middle
fine.

00:31:56.136 --> 00:31:57.086 A:middle
It's a better layout than we had

00:31:57.086 --> 00:31:57.486 A:middle
before.

00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:59.386 A:middle
And what I can do now is take

00:31:59.806 --> 00:32:01.596 A:middle
