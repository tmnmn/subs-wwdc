00:28:58.876 --> 00:29:00.366 A:middle
Now the great thing about unsafe

00:29:00.456 --> 00:29:01.926 A:middle
bit cast is that it returns a

00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:04.026 A:middle
typed result, so we can call our

00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:05.266 A:middle
functions and property names on

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:06.276 A:middle
it such as .frame.

00:29:06.856 --> 00:29:08.036 A:middle
And in this case, I'd like to

00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:09.936 A:middle
inspect a center point and then

00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:11.026 A:middle
modify that center point.

00:29:11.026 --> 00:29:12.216 A:middle
Let's change it to 300

00:29:12.896 --> 00:29:14.276 A:middle
[inaudible] we can see it has

00:29:14.276 --> 00:29:17.076 A:middle
changed to 300, but the view in

00:29:17.076 --> 00:29:18.176 A:middle
the simulator hasn't moved.

00:29:18.376 --> 00:29:18.876 A:middle
Well, why not?

00:29:19.756 --> 00:29:20.526 A:middle
Well, we're paused in the

00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:22.126 A:middle
debugger, so cronomation isn't

00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:23.606 A:middle
currently applying any view

00:29:23.606 --> 00:29:24.776 A:middle
module changes to the screen's

00:29:24.776 --> 00:29:25.156 A:middle
frame buffer.

00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:26.976 A:middle
But we can ask cronomation to do

00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:28.566 A:middle
that for us, just use the

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:31.526 A:middle
expression ca transaction.flush

00:29:32.016 --> 00:29:34.486 A:middle
and that tells cronomation to

00:29:34.486 --> 00:29:35.606 A:middle
update the screen's frame

00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:35.836 A:middle
buffer.

00:29:36.516 --> 00:29:41.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:42.116 --> 00:29:43.436 A:middle
So now, I can just use these two

00:29:43.436 --> 00:29:45.506 A:middle
lines to fix the new positions

00:29:45.596 --> 00:29:46.996 A:middle
and continue flashing and we can

00:29:46.996 --> 00:29:47.516 A:middle
move [inaudible] around.

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:48.986 A:middle
And in fact, I find this to be

00:29:48.986 --> 00:29:50.046 A:middle
so convenient that I kind of

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:51.146 A:middle
wanted to wrap all this up in

00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:52.496 A:middle
just a single command to nudge

00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:53.816 A:middle
views around, and so that's what

00:29:53.816 --> 00:29:54.046 A:middle
I did.

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:55.336 A:middle
Let me show you that.

00:29:55.336 --> 00:29:57.296 A:middle
I'm going to switch to terminal

00:29:57.656 --> 00:29:58.916 A:middle
and open a Python file.

00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:00.926 A:middle
Why a Python file?
