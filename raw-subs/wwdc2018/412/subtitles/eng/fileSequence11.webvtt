00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:01.626 A:middle
that, and here we can enter any

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:04.226 A:middle
function or method name such as

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:06.706 A:middle
UI labels, set text, which we'll

00:11:06.706 --> 00:11:09.066 A:middle
need in this case, and we enter

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:10.966 A:middle
it in Objective-C format because

00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:12.306 A:middle
UIKit is in Objective-C

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:12.806 A:middle
framework.

00:11:13.546 --> 00:11:14.456 A:middle
The thing to point out, if I

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:16.516 A:middle
dismiss that, is that below the

00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:18.906 A:middle
breakpoint, there is a

00:11:18.906 --> 00:11:20.586 A:middle
[inaudible] added and this is

00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:21.506 A:middle
the feedback from the debugger

00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:22.696 A:middle
to tell us that it was able to

00:11:22.696 --> 00:11:24.176 A:middle
resolve this breakpoint to one

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:25.586 A:middle
location in UIKit, Core.

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:27.336 A:middle
Some symbols may result in

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:28.466 A:middle
multiple locations, and you

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:29.306 A:middle
would see them all here.

00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:30.786 A:middle
And if you saw no [inaudible]

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:32.216 A:middle
entries, that would indicate

00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:33.886 A:middle
that the debugger wasn't able to

00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:35.176 A:middle
resolve your breakpoint, so it

00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:35.606 A:middle
wouldn't hit.

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:38.216 A:middle
So with that in place, I'm going

00:11:38.216 --> 00:11:40.476 A:middle
to tap the astronaut again, and

00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:41.726 A:middle
now we see that we've hit the

00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:43.416 A:middle
breakpoint in UI label set text.

00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:45.216 A:middle
Now we don't have the source

00:11:45.216 --> 00:11:46.926 A:middle
code for UIKit, of course, so

00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:48.166 A:middle
we're looking at assembly code,

00:11:48.586 --> 00:11:49.716 A:middle
but there's no need to remain in

00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:50.876 A:middle
the dark even if you're in

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.256 A:middle
assembly code of one of the

00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:54.116 A:middle
system frameworks.

00:11:54.426 --> 00:11:56.186 A:middle
We can inspect the arguments

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:57.196 A:middle
passed into a function.

00:11:57.196 --> 00:11:58.556 A:middle
You just need to know the

00:11:58.556 --> 00:11:59.586 A:middle
calling convention for the

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.446 A:middle
architecture, and you can
