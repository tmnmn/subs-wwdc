00:13:59.656 --> 00:14:01.066 A:middle
could edit an expression to test

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:02.386 A:middle
if that was false and then the

00:14:02.386 --> 00:14:03.506 A:middle
breakpoint would trigger.

00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:04.876 A:middle
I don't have a property in this

00:14:04.876 --> 00:14:05.866 A:middle
case, so I'm going to show you a

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:06.536 A:middle
different method.

00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:08.046 A:middle
I'm going to delete that

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:10.426 A:middle
symbolic breakpoint and instead,

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:12.196 A:middle
scroll down to this function

00:14:12.196 --> 00:14:13.286 A:middle
jump completed and set a

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.076 A:middle
breakpoint here.

00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:16.046 A:middle
Now jump completed is called

00:14:16.046 --> 00:14:17.896 A:middle
after the animation has finished

00:14:18.256 --> 00:14:19.526 A:middle
so that it can update UI and

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.406 A:middle
update game state.

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:22.196 A:middle
However, we don't want a break

00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:23.106 A:middle
in this function.

00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:24.526 A:middle
What I want to do is configure

00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:26.436 A:middle
this breakpoint to actually set

00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:27.956 A:middle
the symbolic breakpoint in UI

00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:29.086 A:middle
label set text for me.

00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:30.806 A:middle
And I can do that by adding a

00:14:30.806 --> 00:14:32.736 A:middle
debugger command action, which

00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:34.366 A:middle
is breakpoint set, and I'm going

00:14:34.366 --> 00:14:36.366 A:middle
to use the option one shot true.

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:38.746 A:middle
And a one shot breakpoint is a

00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:40.396 A:middle
temporary breakpoint that only

00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:41.996 A:middle
exists until it's triggered and

00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:43.196 A:middle
then it's automatically deleted.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.546 A:middle
And we can give it the symbolic

00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:48.366 A:middle
name, UI label set text, and

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:49.586 A:middle
make this an order continuing

00:14:49.586 --> 00:14:50.076 A:middle
breakpoint.

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:51.646 A:middle
So what we've created, in this

00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:53.936 A:middle
case, is a breakpoint that when

00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:55.336 A:middle
the execution enters the jump

00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:57.766 A:middle
completed function, it sets a

00:14:58.146 --> 00:14:59.136 A:middle
temporary breakpoint in the

00:14:59.136 --> 00:15:00.396 A:middle
location we're interested in and
