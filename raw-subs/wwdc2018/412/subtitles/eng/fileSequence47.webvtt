00:46:59.856 --> 00:47:01.586 A:middle
objects in the outline on the

00:47:01.586 --> 00:47:02.236 A:middle
left-hand side.

00:47:02.756 --> 00:47:05.056 A:middle
So take a look there, if you

00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:06.436 A:middle
think your application should

00:47:06.436 --> 00:47:07.816 A:middle
have multiple windows that

00:47:08.106 --> 00:47:09.186 A:middle
should be captured by the view

00:47:09.186 --> 00:47:09.456 A:middle
debugger.

00:47:10.026 --> 00:47:11.576 A:middle
So we can take a look at this in

00:47:11.576 --> 00:47:12.966 A:middle
3D, and we can see that there's

00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:16.026 A:middle
this large view that's obscuring

00:47:16.426 --> 00:47:18.066 A:middle
clicks to the labels.

00:47:18.066 --> 00:47:18.956 A:middle
I would like to take a look at

00:47:18.956 --> 00:47:20.586 A:middle
the labels to inspect them.

00:47:20.996 --> 00:47:22.556 A:middle
There's a trick to click through

00:47:22.556 --> 00:47:23.456 A:middle
views in the view debugger.

00:47:23.456 --> 00:47:24.526 A:middle
You can simply hold down

00:47:24.526 --> 00:47:25.046 A:middle
command.

00:47:25.666 --> 00:47:27.046 A:middle
So I can click through this view

00:47:27.046 --> 00:47:28.466 A:middle
in front and select this blue

00:47:28.466 --> 00:47:28.816 A:middle
label.

00:47:29.496 --> 00:47:31.346 A:middle
So let's take a look at the text

00:47:31.346 --> 00:47:32.086 A:middle
color for this label.

00:47:32.086 --> 00:47:33.326 A:middle
I want to first look at the

00:47:33.326 --> 00:47:34.566 A:middle
labels that look great in dark

00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:35.896 A:middle
so that we can hopefully derive

00:47:35.926 --> 00:47:37.666 A:middle
a solution for the problematic

00:47:37.666 --> 00:47:38.426 A:middle
label at the bottom.

00:47:38.456 --> 00:47:41.016 A:middle
So let's take a look at the text

00:47:41.016 --> 00:47:42.196 A:middle
color and we can see that this

00:47:42.196 --> 00:47:44.406 A:middle
is a RGB color resulting in this

00:47:44.406 --> 00:47:45.846 A:middle
blue and we can also see that

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:47.366 A:middle
the inspector provides us with a

00:47:47.366 --> 00:47:48.166 A:middle
name for this color.

00:47:48.276 --> 00:47:49.386 A:middle
Now this indicates that this

00:47:49.386 --> 00:47:51.426 A:middle
color is coming from an asset

00:47:51.426 --> 00:47:53.026 A:middle
catalogue in our project and

00:47:53.026 --> 00:47:54.366 A:middle
with Xcode 10, you can provide

00:47:54.366 --> 00:47:56.506 A:middle
multiple variants of a color for

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:57.726 A:middle
a single color that you define.

00:47:57.766 --> 00:47:58.956 A:middle
So, for example, you can provide

00:47:58.956 --> 00:48:00.296 A:middle
one for light and one for dark.
