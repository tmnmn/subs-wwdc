00:39:59.016 --> 00:40:00.016 A:middle
We can now, on the left-hand

00:40:00.016 --> 00:40:02.186 A:middle
side, see it relative to its

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:03.456 A:middle
super and sub views.

00:40:04.526 --> 00:40:05.696 A:middle
Now, we can see that super view

00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:07.216 A:middle
is in fact an NS image view, so

00:40:07.216 --> 00:40:08.116 A:middle
that's what we're looking for.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:10.066 A:middle
We can also see that its super

00:40:10.066 --> 00:40:12.226 A:middle
view is a planet globe view, and

00:40:12.696 --> 00:40:14.026 A:middle
the super view of the planet

00:40:14.026 --> 00:40:15.656 A:middle
globe view is an NS effect view.

00:40:16.666 --> 00:40:18.226 A:middle
So I will select the image view

00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:20.856 A:middle
here and we can now also see

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:22.166 A:middle
other properties of the image

00:40:22.166 --> 00:40:22.956 A:middle
view on the right-hand side.

00:40:23.586 --> 00:40:24.746 A:middle
So let's inspect the layout of

00:40:24.796 --> 00:40:25.176 A:middle
this view.

00:40:25.826 --> 00:40:26.856 A:middle
I'm using auto-layout in this

00:40:26.856 --> 00:40:28.296 A:middle
application, so I want to take a

00:40:28.296 --> 00:40:28.996 A:middle
look at the auto-layout

00:40:28.996 --> 00:40:29.536 A:middle
constraints.

00:40:30.286 --> 00:40:31.656 A:middle
I can show the constraints using

00:40:31.656 --> 00:40:34.466 A:middle
this button here, and we can now

00:40:34.466 --> 00:40:35.666 A:middle
see all the constraints that

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.816 A:middle
currently affect the layout of

00:40:36.886 --> 00:40:37.276 A:middle
this view.

00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:39.406 A:middle
You can see that there's, for

00:40:39.406 --> 00:40:40.176 A:middle
example, an [inaudible]

00:40:40.386 --> 00:40:41.496 A:middle
constraint here.

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.346 A:middle
We can also see this vertical

00:40:43.556 --> 00:40:45.116 A:middle
line here, which is an alignment

00:40:45.116 --> 00:40:45.586 A:middle
constraint.

00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:48.336 A:middle
When I select this constraint,

00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:49.766 A:middle
we can see all the properties in

00:40:49.766 --> 00:40:50.746 A:middle
the inspect on the right-hand

00:40:50.746 --> 00:40:50.976 A:middle
side.

00:40:51.326 --> 00:40:52.326 A:middle
If you're wondering why the view

00:40:52.326 --> 00:40:53.236 A:middle
debugger only shows you

00:40:53.236 --> 00:40:55.086 A:middle
wireframes right now, that is

00:40:55.156 --> 00:40:56.156 A:middle
because it only shows the

00:40:56.156 --> 00:40:57.316 A:middle
content of the views that

00:40:57.406 --> 00:40:58.566 A:middle
currently participate in the

00:40:58.566 --> 00:40:59.706 A:middle
layout of the selected view.
