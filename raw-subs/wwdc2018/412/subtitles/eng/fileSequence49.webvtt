00:48:59.226 --> 00:49:01.056 A:middle
Okay, so let's get back to the

00:49:01.056 --> 00:49:01.576 A:middle
text color.

00:49:01.926 --> 00:49:03.126 A:middle
And I want to select the second

00:49:03.126 --> 00:49:04.376 A:middle
label since that also looks good

00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:04.826 A:middle
in dark.

00:49:05.126 --> 00:49:06.326 A:middle
And in this case, we can see

00:49:06.326 --> 00:49:07.456 A:middle
there's also a name color.

00:49:07.456 --> 00:49:08.956 A:middle
It's a label color, but it's

00:49:08.956 --> 00:49:10.046 A:middle
prefixed with system.

00:49:10.226 --> 00:49:11.366 A:middle
And that indicates that it's not

00:49:11.366 --> 00:49:12.506 A:middle
coming from our own asset

00:49:12.506 --> 00:49:13.736 A:middle
catalogue but from the system,

00:49:14.036 --> 00:49:15.226 A:middle
and of course, system colors

00:49:15.226 --> 00:49:16.316 A:middle
automatically adapt to

00:49:16.316 --> 00:49:17.376 A:middle
appearance changes as well.

00:49:18.336 --> 00:49:19.886 A:middle
Now, taking a look at the

00:49:19.886 --> 00:49:21.756 A:middle
problematic label here, we can

00:49:21.756 --> 00:49:23.246 A:middle
see that it's this very dark

00:49:23.246 --> 00:49:24.786 A:middle
gray, and it doesn't have a

00:49:24.786 --> 00:49:25.046 A:middle
name.

00:49:25.176 --> 00:49:27.266 A:middle
That means it's a custom color

00:49:27.436 --> 00:49:29.696 A:middle
that doesn't adapt to appearance

00:49:29.696 --> 00:49:30.066 A:middle
changes.

00:49:30.906 --> 00:49:32.206 A:middle
So what we want to do is we want

00:49:32.206 --> 00:49:34.436 A:middle
to change its color, its text

00:49:34.436 --> 00:49:37.776 A:middle
color, to a system color.

00:49:37.946 --> 00:49:39.316 A:middle
So with this object selected,

00:49:39.316 --> 00:49:40.316 A:middle
I'll hit command c.

00:49:41.196 --> 00:49:43.396 A:middle
I'll type e, paste in the

00:49:43.396 --> 00:49:44.916 A:middle
[inaudible] pointer and say set

00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:49.476 A:middle
text color to NS color text

00:49:49.476 --> 00:49:49.696 A:middle
color.

00:49:51.436 --> 00:49:52.576 A:middle
Again, I have to [inaudible] to

00:49:52.576 --> 00:49:53.296 A:middle
see a transaction.

00:49:53.996 --> 00:49:55.296 A:middle
And we can see that the popover

00:49:55.296 --> 00:49:56.926 A:middle
now updates, and the font is

00:49:56.926 --> 00:49:57.576 A:middle
nice and readable.

00:49:58.556 --> 00:49:59.846 A:middle
Now, I'm not going to apply this

00:49:59.966 --> 00:50:01.866 A:middle
fix in my storybook file.
