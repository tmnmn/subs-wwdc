00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:01.186 A:middle
And at the tenth, we see that it

00:24:01.186 --> 00:24:02.566 A:middle
does indeed detect end-of-game

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:03.586 A:middle
state, so it looks like that's

00:24:03.586 --> 00:24:04.846 A:middle
the fix we need.

00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:11.666 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:13.646 A:middle
And now, don't forget to apply

00:24:13.646 --> 00:24:14.326 A:middle
that to your code.

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:16.276 A:middle
So I'm just copy that out, drag

00:24:16.306 --> 00:24:17.426 A:middle
the breakpoint to delete it.

00:24:17.426 --> 00:24:18.966 A:middle
And then I can paste that in and

00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:19.516 A:middle
that looks good.

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:21.646 A:middle
So let's check that one off, and

00:24:21.646 --> 00:24:22.776 A:middle
we've only got one more left for

00:24:22.776 --> 00:24:24.326 A:middle
this section and that's the

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:25.826 A:middle
layout of the attempt and score

00:24:25.826 --> 00:24:26.276 A:middle
labels.

00:24:26.726 --> 00:24:28.076 A:middle
Now, the layout of this

00:24:28.076 --> 00:24:29.406 A:middle
application has been left up to

00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:31.066 A:middle
the engineers, and as good

00:24:31.066 --> 00:24:32.516 A:middle
engineers do, we've found an

00:24:32.516 --> 00:24:34.116 A:middle
efficient location stuffed right

00:24:34.116 --> 00:24:35.136 A:middle
up in the top corners.

00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:37.126 A:middle
But the team decided that wasn't

00:24:37.126 --> 00:24:39.056 A:middle
very appropriate, so they've

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:40.306 A:middle
sent it back and asked us to try

00:24:40.306 --> 00:24:40.616 A:middle
again.

00:24:40.956 --> 00:24:42.636 A:middle
So I'd like to mock up a new

00:24:42.636 --> 00:24:44.406 A:middle
layout for these score labels.

00:24:44.736 --> 00:24:45.866 A:middle
Now I could get out my graphical

00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:46.986 A:middle
application and start mocking it

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:48.176 A:middle
up, but I'm an engineer and I

00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.236 A:middle
like to mock up using code.

00:24:49.236 --> 00:24:50.466 A:middle
In fact, I'm a debugger

00:24:50.466 --> 00:24:51.796 A:middle
engineer, so I like to mock up

00:24:51.796 --> 00:24:52.896 A:middle
using the debugger with a live

00:24:52.896 --> 00:24:54.026 A:middle
application and real data.

00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:55.006 A:middle
So let me show you how to do

00:24:55.006 --> 00:24:56.000 A:middle
that.

00:24:59.146 --> 00:25:01.226 A:middle
Let's navigate back and put
