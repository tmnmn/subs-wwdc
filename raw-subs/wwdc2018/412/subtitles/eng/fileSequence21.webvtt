00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:00.026 A:middle
object, and here we see the

00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:01.656 A:middle
debugged description for this

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:02.556 A:middle
GamePlay object.

00:21:02.986 --> 00:21:04.186 A:middle
And we have a custom debugged

00:21:04.186 --> 00:21:05.676 A:middle
description here, so it's worth

00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:07.726 A:middle
pointing out that po requests

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:08.596 A:middle
the programmatic debug

00:21:08.626 --> 00:21:10.116 A:middle
description of an object and you

00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:11.196 A:middle
can customize these.

00:21:11.696 --> 00:21:12.586 A:middle
I'll show you how we did that

00:21:12.586 --> 00:21:13.246 A:middle
for GamePlay.

00:21:13.316 --> 00:21:14.546 A:middle
If I switch to the source code

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.626 A:middle
and scroll to the bottom, you

00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:17.856 A:middle
can see that we've added an

00:21:17.856 --> 00:21:19.656 A:middle
extension to conform GamePlay to

00:21:19.796 --> 00:21:21.626 A:middle
custom debug string convertible.

00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:23.546 A:middle
And conformance requires that

00:21:23.546 --> 00:21:25.676 A:middle
you implement a property called

00:21:25.676 --> 00:21:27.126 A:middle
debug description and return a

00:21:27.126 --> 00:21:27.526 A:middle
string.

00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:29.656 A:middle
And you can return whatever

00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:31.136 A:middle
string you like to represent

00:21:31.136 --> 00:21:32.756 A:middle
this object for your debugging

00:21:32.756 --> 00:21:33.386 A:middle
purposes.

00:21:34.096 --> 00:21:35.896 A:middle
You can do the same for

00:21:35.976 --> 00:21:37.486 A:middle
Objective-C objects as well by

00:21:37.486 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle
implementing debug description.

00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:41.366 A:middle
Compare that with the command p

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:41.826 A:middle
GamePlay.

00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:46.796 A:middle
P is an alternate LLDB command,

00:21:47.136 --> 00:21:48.746 A:middle
which uses LLDB's built-in

00:21:48.746 --> 00:21:50.256 A:middle
formatters to represent the

00:21:50.256 --> 00:21:50.676 A:middle
object.

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:51.586 A:middle
So here, we see two

00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:52.706 A:middle
representations of the same

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:55.106 A:middle
object, and default formatter

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:56.126 A:middle
shows you the full [inaudible]

00:21:56.126 --> 00:21:57.446 A:middle
type name, the memory address,

00:21:57.806 --> 00:21:58.826 A:middle
and then a list of all the

00:21:58.826 --> 00:21:59.986 A:middle
properties and their values.
