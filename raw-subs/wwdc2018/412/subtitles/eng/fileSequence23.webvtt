00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:00.796 A:middle
code that's modifying the

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:01.706 A:middle
attempts variable.

00:23:02.186 --> 00:23:04.436 A:middle
I can disable this watchpoint

00:23:04.436 --> 00:23:05.336 A:middle
because I no longer need it.

00:23:05.336 --> 00:23:06.736 A:middle
And we can look at the code here

00:23:06.936 --> 00:23:07.896 A:middle
while the game's playing,

00:23:07.896 --> 00:23:09.126 A:middle
increment attempts, and if

00:23:09.126 --> 00:23:10.376 A:middle
successful, increment score.

00:23:10.716 --> 00:23:12.106 A:middle
So I'm not seeing any logic that

00:23:12.106 --> 00:23:13.406 A:middle
will detect if attempts has

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:15.426 A:middle
exceeded maximum and transition

00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:16.526 A:middle
to the end-of-game state.

00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:18.086 A:middle
So I think that's all that's

00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:19.416 A:middle
needed, but in this case, I'd

00:23:19.416 --> 00:23:20.786 A:middle
like to test my hypothesis

00:23:21.006 --> 00:23:22.406 A:middle
before I make any actual code

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:22.916 A:middle
changes.

00:23:23.316 --> 00:23:24.596 A:middle
So I'm going to create a

00:23:24.596 --> 00:23:26.306 A:middle
breakpoint and configure it to

00:23:26.306 --> 00:23:27.616 A:middle
inject that change to see if it

00:23:27.616 --> 00:23:29.246 A:middle
fixes the problem before I make

00:23:29.246 --> 00:23:30.096 A:middle
any code changes.

00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:31.656 A:middle
So once again, I can add a

00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:32.876 A:middle
debugger command action with an

00:23:32.876 --> 00:23:34.676 A:middle
expression and I think what we

00:23:34.676 --> 00:23:36.406 A:middle
need is if attempts is greater

00:23:36.406 --> 00:23:38.516 A:middle
and equal to max attempts, then

00:23:38.516 --> 00:23:39.826 A:middle
we change the game state to

00:23:39.826 --> 00:23:41.826 A:middle
ended and make this order

00:23:41.826 --> 00:23:42.356 A:middle
continuing.

00:23:42.996 --> 00:23:44.406 A:middle
So now it's easy just to test if

00:23:44.406 --> 00:23:45.666 A:middle
that actually fixes the problem

00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:46.616 A:middle
by pressing continue.

00:23:46.876 --> 00:23:48.136 A:middle
Execution will continue through

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:48.816 A:middle
this breakpoint.

00:23:49.116 --> 00:23:50.486 A:middle
Inject the code and we can see

00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:51.856 A:middle
that it does look like it fixes

00:23:51.856 --> 00:23:52.286 A:middle
the problem.

00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:54.166 A:middle
I'd like to verify that from the

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.356 A:middle
start of the game and I can

00:23:55.356 --> 00:23:56.386 A:middle
quickly and easily do that by

00:23:56.386 --> 00:23:58.146 A:middle
clicking play again and rapidly

00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.526 A:middle
progressing through 10 attempts.

00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:01.186 A:middle
And at the tenth, we see that it
