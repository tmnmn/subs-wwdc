00:41:58.656 --> 00:42:00.196 A:middle
to its super view and it does so

00:42:00.196 --> 00:42:02.176 A:middle
with a constant of 30, so that

00:42:02.176 --> 00:42:02.666 A:middle
makes sense.

00:42:03.366 --> 00:42:04.536 A:middle
And then the trailing constraint

00:42:04.536 --> 00:42:07.916 A:middle
here aligns the trailing edge of

00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:09.256 A:middle
the planet globe view with the

00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:10.546 A:middle
trailing edge of the super view,

00:42:10.956 --> 00:42:11.956 A:middle
and it also does so with a

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:12.846 A:middle
constant of 30.

00:42:13.426 --> 00:42:14.156 A:middle
Now the fact that this

00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:15.686 A:middle
constraint doesn't attach to

00:42:15.686 --> 00:42:16.796 A:middle
anything on the right-hand side

00:42:16.796 --> 00:42:17.866 A:middle
is a little bit suspicious and

00:42:17.866 --> 00:42:19.016 A:middle
makes me wonder if we see the

00:42:19.016 --> 00:42:19.716 A:middle
whole picture here.

00:42:20.206 --> 00:42:21.306 A:middle
In such a situation, it's

00:42:21.306 --> 00:42:22.426 A:middle
usually a good idea to see if

00:42:22.426 --> 00:42:23.326 A:middle
there's any content that's

00:42:23.326 --> 00:42:24.396 A:middle
currently being clipped that we

00:42:24.396 --> 00:42:25.336 A:middle
don't see by default.

00:42:26.006 --> 00:42:27.456 A:middle
And you can do so using this

00:42:27.496 --> 00:42:28.776 A:middle
button down here to show clip

00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:29.316 A:middle
content.

00:42:29.706 --> 00:42:30.916 A:middle
Now, when I enable this

00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:32.186 A:middle
functionality, you can see that

00:42:32.186 --> 00:42:33.296 A:middle
the planet globe view actually

00:42:33.326 --> 00:42:34.816 A:middle
extends past the window bounds

00:42:34.816 --> 00:42:36.436 A:middle
towards the right-hand side, and

00:42:36.436 --> 00:42:38.026 A:middle
now the horizontal centering

00:42:38.516 --> 00:42:39.876 A:middle
constraint makes sense again

00:42:39.876 --> 00:42:40.926 A:middle
since it actually correctly

00:42:40.926 --> 00:42:42.946 A:middle
centers it in the super view.

00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:44.916 A:middle
However, the super view just

00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:46.176 A:middle
extends past the window.

00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:48.166 A:middle
This is a very common issue if

00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:49.186 A:middle
you set up your constraints in

00:42:49.186 --> 00:42:50.216 A:middle
code, where you accidentally

00:42:50.216 --> 00:42:51.696 A:middle
swap first and second item and

00:42:51.696 --> 00:42:52.826 A:middle
thereby get the layout direction

00:42:52.826 --> 00:42:53.106 A:middle
wrong.

00:42:53.506 --> 00:42:54.906 A:middle
Or you accidentally invert the

00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:57.166 A:middle
constant, and in this case, we

00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:58.636 A:middle
used 30 instead of using

00:42:58.636 --> 00:43:00.226 A:middle
negative 30 to insert it towards
