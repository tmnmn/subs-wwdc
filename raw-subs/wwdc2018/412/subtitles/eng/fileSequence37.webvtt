00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:00.996 A:middle
readable in dark mode.

00:37:01.226 --> 00:37:02.476 A:middle
Let me show you what that is

00:37:02.476 --> 00:37:03.066 A:middle
referring to.

00:37:03.696 --> 00:37:05.526 A:middle
When I switch to this app, I can

00:37:05.526 --> 00:37:07.006 A:middle
bring up the orbital details

00:37:07.136 --> 00:37:08.376 A:middle
information in this popover

00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:08.676 A:middle
here.

00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:10.256 A:middle
You can see that the labels at

00:37:10.256 --> 00:37:11.426 A:middle
the top and nice and readable;

00:37:11.506 --> 00:37:13.416 A:middle
however, the label at the bottom

00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:14.436 A:middle
is so hard to read, I really

00:37:14.436 --> 00:37:15.666 A:middle
have to select the text to read

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:15.806 A:middle
it.

00:37:16.616 --> 00:37:17.626 A:middle
So these are the two bugs we

00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:18.626 A:middle
have to take a look at.

00:37:19.196 --> 00:37:20.776 A:middle
Let me hide the to do list and

00:37:20.776 --> 00:37:21.436 A:middle
let's jump right in.

00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:23.536 A:middle
So what I want to do is I want

00:37:23.536 --> 00:37:24.676 A:middle
to capture the view hierarchy of

00:37:24.716 --> 00:37:26.086 A:middle
this application with Xcode,

00:37:26.686 --> 00:37:27.756 A:middle
then inspect it.

00:37:28.566 --> 00:37:29.846 A:middle
We'll find the problem and then

00:37:29.846 --> 00:37:31.026 A:middle
hopefully find the fix, so we

00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:31.746 A:middle
can all have a beer.

00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:34.306 A:middle
The problem is when I switch to

00:37:34.306 --> 00:37:35.386 A:middle
Xcode to capture the view

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.276 A:middle
hierarchy, this popover will be

00:37:37.276 --> 00:37:39.336 A:middle
dismissed since the application

00:37:39.336 --> 00:37:40.756 A:middle
goes into the background, and we

00:37:40.756 --> 00:37:41.936 A:middle
won't be able to capture its

00:37:41.936 --> 00:37:42.396 A:middle
view hierarchy.

00:37:43.226 --> 00:37:44.296 A:middle
So what we have to do is we have

00:37:44.296 --> 00:37:46.056 A:middle
to capture the app in its active

00:37:46.056 --> 00:37:47.586 A:middle
state, and I will show you two

00:37:47.586 --> 00:37:48.526 A:middle
ways how to do that.

00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:50.856 A:middle
And you can see when I now

00:37:50.856 --> 00:37:52.306 A:middle
switch to Xcode how this popover

00:37:52.306 --> 00:37:53.086 A:middle
is being dismissed.

00:37:54.116 --> 00:37:55.486 A:middle
First of all, we can use the

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:56.776 A:middle
touch bar, and I'll show you

00:37:56.776 --> 00:37:57.896 A:middle
what that looks like by bringing

00:37:57.896 --> 00:37:59.276 A:middle
up the touch bar simulator from

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:00.306 A:middle
Xcode's window menu.
