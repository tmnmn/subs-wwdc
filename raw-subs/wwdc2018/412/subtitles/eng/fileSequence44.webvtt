00:43:59.786 --> 00:44:02.776 A:middle
set constant to negative 30.

00:44:03.276 --> 00:44:05.006 A:middle
We have the same problem that

00:44:05.306 --> 00:44:06.736 A:middle
the path application doesn't

00:44:06.736 --> 00:44:08.066 A:middle
update that Chris saw earlier,

00:44:08.606 --> 00:44:09.796 A:middle
so what I'm going to do or what

00:44:09.796 --> 00:44:11.006 A:middle
I have to do is I have to

00:44:11.356 --> 00:44:13.076 A:middle
[inaudible] the ca transaction

00:44:13.176 --> 00:44:16.086 A:middle
to [inaudible] application

00:44:16.456 --> 00:44:18.716 A:middle
schedule update of its UI.

00:44:18.716 --> 00:44:21.166 A:middle
I can use the handy command that

00:44:21.166 --> 00:44:24.216 A:middle
Chris added earlier, so I can

00:44:24.616 --> 00:44:25.526 A:middle
take the command from here.

00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:27.896 A:middle
And we can now see that the

00:44:27.926 --> 00:44:29.246 A:middle
planet image is horizontally

00:44:29.246 --> 00:44:30.866 A:middle
centered correctly, so inverting

00:44:30.866 --> 00:44:31.696 A:middle
the constant was the correct

00:44:31.696 --> 00:44:32.066 A:middle
fix.

00:44:32.466 --> 00:44:34.026 A:middle
So we were able to confirm this,

00:44:34.426 --> 00:44:35.676 A:middle
so let's apply this change in

00:44:35.676 --> 00:44:36.126 A:middle
our code.

00:44:36.696 --> 00:44:39.186 A:middle
With the constraints selected,

00:44:39.466 --> 00:44:40.236 A:middle
you can see that on the

00:44:40.236 --> 00:44:42.156 A:middle
right-hand side I can see this

00:44:42.156 --> 00:44:43.416 A:middle
back trace here, and that is the

00:44:43.416 --> 00:44:44.836 A:middle
allocation back trace of the

00:44:44.896 --> 00:44:46.116 A:middle
constraint and tells me exactly

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:47.746 A:middle
in which frame it was allocated.

00:44:48.016 --> 00:44:49.236 A:middle
So it allows me to jump right to

00:44:49.236 --> 00:44:51.276 A:middle
the code where I created that

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:51.796 A:middle
constraint.

00:44:52.726 --> 00:44:55.076 A:middle
Now to have this creation back

00:44:55.076 --> 00:44:56.276 A:middle
traces show up, you have to

00:44:56.276 --> 00:44:58.356 A:middle
enable mailx backlogging and let

00:44:58.356 --> 00:44:59.906 A:middle
me show you how you enable that.
