00:24:59.146 --> 00:25:01.226 A:middle
Let's navigate back and put

00:25:01.226 --> 00:25:02.796 A:middle
breakpoint in the jump function.

00:25:03.136 --> 00:25:04.686 A:middle
What we need to do is first find

00:25:04.686 --> 00:25:06.126 A:middle
a reference to a view that we

00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:07.796 A:middle
can play around with, so I'm

00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:09.466 A:middle
going to clear everything and

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:10.946 A:middle
open that up and start a new

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:11.216 A:middle
jump.

00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:12.446 A:middle
So we're paused in the debugger

00:25:13.006 --> 00:25:14.656 A:middle
in this jump function within the

00:25:14.656 --> 00:25:15.336 A:middle
view controller.

00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:17.666 A:middle
So if you have of course a

00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:18.906 A:middle
property or an outlet for a

00:25:18.906 --> 00:25:19.686 A:middle
view, then that's a good

00:25:19.686 --> 00:25:20.176 A:middle
reference.

00:25:20.446 --> 00:25:21.596 A:middle
But if you don't, then you need

00:25:21.596 --> 00:25:22.536 A:middle
to get the memory address of a

00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:22.756 A:middle
view.

00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:24.176 A:middle
So let me show you some ways to

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:25.286 A:middle
find the memory address and how

00:25:25.286 --> 00:25:26.946 A:middle
to manipulate a view only by

00:25:26.946 --> 00:25:27.636 A:middle
memory address.

00:25:28.206 --> 00:25:30.396 A:middle
Well, like we said before, the

00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:31.686 A:middle
debug description contains a

00:25:31.686 --> 00:25:32.616 A:middle
custom description.

00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:33.826 A:middle
So looking at the view

00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:35.036 A:middle
controller's view, we can see

00:25:35.036 --> 00:25:36.386 A:middle
the default debug description

00:25:36.386 --> 00:25:38.426 A:middle
for a UI view has the class of

00:25:38.426 --> 00:25:39.476 A:middle
the view and then the memory

00:25:39.476 --> 00:25:39.906 A:middle
address.

00:25:40.216 --> 00:25:41.606 A:middle
So one way is to just get the

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:44.676 A:middle
debug description for objects.

00:25:45.176 --> 00:25:46.476 A:middle
So that's easy to get it for

00:25:46.476 --> 00:25:47.686 A:middle
this one because there's a

00:25:47.686 --> 00:25:48.456 A:middle
property for it.

00:25:48.746 --> 00:25:50.306 A:middle
But how about all of the views

00:25:50.346 --> 00:25:51.976 A:middle
below this view controller's

00:25:51.976 --> 00:25:52.166 A:middle
view?

00:25:52.806 --> 00:25:53.506 A:middle
Well, we need to look at the

00:25:53.506 --> 00:25:55.256 A:middle
view hierarchy and one way to do

00:25:55.256 --> 00:25:57.126 A:middle
that is to use this button here,

00:25:57.126 --> 00:25:59.136 A:middle
which invokes Xcode's visual

00:25:59.136 --> 00:25:59.606 A:middle
view debugger.

00:25:59.676 --> 00:26:01.136 A:middle
It will snapshot the hierarchy
