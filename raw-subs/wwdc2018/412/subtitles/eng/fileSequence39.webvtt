00:38:59.676 --> 00:39:00.676 A:middle
application while it was still

00:39:00.826 --> 00:39:02.476 A:middle
in its active state, and we can

00:39:02.476 --> 00:39:04.346 A:middle
see that the UI still renders as

00:39:04.346 --> 00:39:05.796 A:middle
if the app was front most and

00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:06.556 A:middle
the popover hasn't been

00:39:06.556 --> 00:39:07.006 A:middle
dismissed.

00:39:07.456 --> 00:39:08.266 A:middle
If you're wondering why that

00:39:08.266 --> 00:39:09.406 A:middle
spinning [inaudible] is coming

00:39:09.406 --> 00:39:10.236 A:middle
up, that's because the

00:39:10.236 --> 00:39:11.216 A:middle
application is paused in the

00:39:11.216 --> 00:39:12.226 A:middle
debugger and doesn't respond to

00:39:12.226 --> 00:39:12.986 A:middle
mouse events anymore.

00:39:14.806 --> 00:39:16.116 A:middle
Now, you may be wondering, if we

00:39:16.116 --> 00:39:17.156 A:middle
take a look at the view debugger

00:39:17.156 --> 00:39:19.256 A:middle
here, why the popover isn't

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:19.616 A:middle
visible.

00:39:20.426 --> 00:39:21.696 A:middle
Don't worry, the view hierarchy

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:22.396 A:middle
has been captured.

00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:24.176 A:middle
I'll get to how we take a look

00:39:24.176 --> 00:39:25.346 A:middle
at the popover once we get to

00:39:25.346 --> 00:39:26.986 A:middle
that bug, but first I want to

00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:28.176 A:middle
take a look at the layout issue

00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:29.786 A:middle
of this image view here.

00:39:29.836 --> 00:39:31.356 A:middle
So I'll select the image view

00:39:31.356 --> 00:39:32.396 A:middle
here and I'll zoom in a little

00:39:32.586 --> 00:39:32.676 A:middle
bit.

00:39:33.176 --> 00:39:34.096 A:middle
When we take a look at the

00:39:34.096 --> 00:39:35.416 A:middle
inspect on the right-hand side,

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:37.276 A:middle
we can see that this is an

00:39:37.326 --> 00:39:39.146 A:middle
underscore NS image view simple

00:39:39.146 --> 00:39:39.546 A:middle
image view.

00:39:39.806 --> 00:39:41.556 A:middle
Now the fact that this is prefix

00:39:41.556 --> 00:39:43.426 A:middle
with an underscore usually hints

00:39:43.426 --> 00:39:44.466 A:middle
at the fact that this is an

00:39:44.516 --> 00:39:45.836 A:middle
internal class from a system

00:39:45.836 --> 00:39:48.496 A:middle
framework and not what we use

00:39:48.496 --> 00:39:50.576 A:middle
when we set up image views in

00:39:50.576 --> 00:39:51.716 A:middle
code or in interface builder.

00:39:51.976 --> 00:39:52.876 A:middle
So let's take a look at this

00:39:52.876 --> 00:39:54.486 A:middle
object in the view hierarchy.

00:39:54.656 --> 00:39:55.836 A:middle
And I can do that by using the

00:39:55.836 --> 00:39:57.696 A:middle
navigate menu, select reveal in

00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.476 A:middle
debug navigator.

00:39:59.016 --> 00:40:00.016 A:middle
We can now, on the left-hand
