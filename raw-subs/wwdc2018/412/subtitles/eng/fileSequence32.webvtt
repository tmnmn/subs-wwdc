00:31:59.806 --> 00:32:01.596 A:middle
the information provided by

00:32:01.596 --> 00:32:03.186 A:middle
nudge, such as the total offset

00:32:03.186 --> 00:32:04.746 A:middle
applied to that view relative to

00:32:04.746 --> 00:32:06.156 A:middle
its original center point, and

00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:07.116 A:middle
then your frame value.

00:32:07.456 --> 00:32:09.026 A:middle
Back to my code and modify my

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.586 A:middle
layout code or my auto-layout

00:32:10.586 --> 00:32:12.086 A:middle
constraints, and I've easily

00:32:12.086 --> 00:32:13.676 A:middle
mocked up a new layout for my

00:32:13.676 --> 00:32:14.026 A:middle
scene.

00:32:14.616 --> 00:32:17.406 A:middle
Now the last thing to do --

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:19.396 A:middle
well, firstly, don't forget to

00:32:19.396 --> 00:32:21.366 A:middle
check off debug, very important.

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:23.786 A:middle
And then the last thing to do

00:32:23.786 --> 00:32:25.506 A:middle
before restarting or recompiling

00:32:25.506 --> 00:32:27.516 A:middle
and rerunning is to disable or

00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:29.466 A:middle
remove any breakpoints that are

00:32:29.466 --> 00:32:30.566 A:middle
injecting expressions because

00:32:30.566 --> 00:32:31.606 A:middle
you don't want those lines to be

00:32:31.606 --> 00:32:32.516 A:middle
executed twice.

00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:34.676 A:middle
Simply selecting them or a group

00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:35.686 A:middle
of them and hitting delete is a

00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:36.816 A:middle
quick way to delete those.

00:32:37.546 --> 00:32:38.576 A:middle
And so those are some of the

00:32:38.576 --> 00:32:40.276 A:middle
debugging techniques that I like

00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:41.596 A:middle
to use to enhance my debugging

00:32:41.596 --> 00:32:42.276 A:middle
workflows.

00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:45.346 A:middle
Notice how we were able to

00:32:45.346 --> 00:32:48.196 A:middle
diagnose and fix all four bugs

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:50.166 A:middle
without having to recompile or

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:50.626 A:middle
rerun.

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:53.106 A:middle
This can be a huge timesaver,

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:54.946 A:middle
especially for complex projects

00:32:55.236 --> 00:32:57.226 A:middle
and can be crucial when trying

00:32:57.226 --> 00:32:59.316 A:middle
to solve hard to reproduce bugs.

00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:01.526 A:middle
So thanks for [inaudible] I hope
