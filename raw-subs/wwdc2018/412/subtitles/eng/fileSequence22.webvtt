00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:01.536 A:middle
So we can see here that there is

00:22:01.536 --> 00:22:02.636 A:middle
a max attempts property, and

00:22:02.636 --> 00:22:04.636 A:middle
it's correctly set to 10, so it

00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:06.126 A:middle
looks like there's perhaps a

00:22:06.126 --> 00:22:07.716 A:middle
logic error where, after

00:22:07.716 --> 00:22:08.876 A:middle
attempts is incremented, it's

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:10.476 A:middle
not successfully determining

00:22:10.476 --> 00:22:11.926 A:middle
that it's past the maximum.

00:22:12.296 --> 00:22:13.406 A:middle
So I'd like to find the code

00:22:13.406 --> 00:22:14.616 A:middle
that's modifying attempts to see

00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:15.646 A:middle
what the logic looks like.

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:17.646 A:middle
I'm going to open the variables

00:22:17.646 --> 00:22:19.046 A:middle
view and expand the view

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:20.016 A:middle
controller to see all its

00:22:20.016 --> 00:22:20.886 A:middle
properties and down at the

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:22.056 A:middle
bottom, I'm going to use the

00:22:22.136 --> 00:22:24.796 A:middle
filter to enter GamePlay to find

00:22:24.796 --> 00:22:25.296 A:middle
that property.

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.286 A:middle
Expand its properties and then

00:22:27.286 --> 00:22:28.586 A:middle
I'm going to select the attempts

00:22:28.616 --> 00:22:28.956 A:middle
property.

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:31.566 A:middle
And down here, I'm going to open

00:22:31.566 --> 00:22:33.786 A:middle
the contextual menu and select

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:34.956 A:middle
watch attempts.

00:22:36.276 --> 00:22:37.716 A:middle
Now what this does is creates

00:22:37.716 --> 00:22:39.026 A:middle
what's called a watchpoint.

00:22:39.656 --> 00:22:40.876 A:middle
In the breakpoint navigator,

00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:42.116 A:middle
below all the breakpoints,

00:22:42.406 --> 00:22:43.586 A:middle
you'll see there's a new group

00:22:43.586 --> 00:22:44.926 A:middle
called watchpoints, and we have

00:22:44.926 --> 00:22:46.366 A:middle
one watchpoint for attempts.

00:22:46.706 --> 00:22:48.156 A:middle
And a watchpoint is like a

00:22:48.156 --> 00:22:49.546 A:middle
breakpoint, but it pauses the

00:22:49.546 --> 00:22:50.826 A:middle
debugger the next time the value

00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:52.966 A:middle
of that variable is changed, so

00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:54.126 A:middle
we can remove this property

00:22:54.126 --> 00:22:55.226 A:middle
breakpoint because we no longer

00:22:55.226 --> 00:22:56.766 A:middle
need it and press continue.

00:22:57.186 --> 00:22:58.456 A:middle
And now we've paused at this

00:22:58.456 --> 00:22:59.886 A:middle
watchpoint, and we found the

00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:00.796 A:middle
code that's modifying the
