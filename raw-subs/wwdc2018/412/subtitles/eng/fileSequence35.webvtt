-O, compared with the p

00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:02.046 A:middle
commands, which is simply an

00:35:02.046 --> 00:35:03.006 A:middle
alias for expression.

00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:05.946 A:middle
And it uses LLDB's built-in

00:35:05.946 --> 00:35:07.116 A:middle
formatters to show a

00:35:07.116 --> 00:35:08.716 A:middle
representation of that object.

00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:10.976 A:middle
The third command that's

00:35:10.976 --> 00:35:12.836 A:middle
important to know is frame

00:35:12.836 --> 00:35:13.296 A:middle
variable.

00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:14.916 A:middle
It differs from the previous two

00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:15.736 A:middle
in that it doesn't have to

00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:16.886 A:middle
compile and evaluate an

00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:17.756 A:middle
expression at all.

00:35:17.986 --> 00:35:19.446 A:middle
It simply reads the value of the

00:35:19.446 --> 00:35:21.066 A:middle
name variable directly from

00:35:21.066 --> 00:35:22.686 A:middle
memory and then uses LLDB's

00:35:22.686 --> 00:35:23.586 A:middle
built-in formatters.

00:35:24.216 --> 00:35:25.196 A:middle
So the choice of which command

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:26.266 A:middle
to use is more personal

00:35:26.266 --> 00:35:27.336 A:middle
preference and the type of

00:35:27.426 --> 00:35:28.436 A:middle
information you want to see

00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:29.076 A:middle
while debugging.

00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:30.876 A:middle
But it's important to remember

00:35:30.876 --> 00:35:31.746 A:middle
that if you ever end up in a

00:35:31.746 --> 00:35:33.986 A:middle
situation where expressions are

00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:36.356 A:middle
failing or so po and p may not

00:35:36.356 --> 00:35:38.036 A:middle
be working for you, if you need

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:39.006 A:middle
to inspect a variable in the

00:35:39.006 --> 00:35:40.066 A:middle
current frame, then frame

00:35:40.066 --> 00:35:40.906 A:middle
variable should still work for

00:35:40.946 --> 00:35:41.000 A:middle
you.

00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:45.436 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to hand

00:35:45.436 --> 00:35:47.246 A:middle
over to Sebastian, who's going

00:35:47.246 --> 00:35:48.596 A:middle
to tell you about some advanced

00:35:48.596 --> 00:35:49.536 A:middle
view debugging techniques.

00:35:49.536 --> 00:35:49.866 A:middle
Thank you.
