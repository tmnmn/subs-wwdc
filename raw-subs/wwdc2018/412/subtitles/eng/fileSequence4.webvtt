00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:02.986 A:middle
Now in making some enhancements

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:05.046 A:middle
to Moon Jumper, such as some

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:06.886 A:middle
visual enhancements and a

00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:08.816 A:middle
GamePlay mode, while we're not

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:10.866 A:middle
ready to ship, we've done a test

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:12.156 A:middle
pass and come up with a list of

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:14.506 A:middle
bugs that we need to look at.

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:15.886 A:middle
So these are the bugs for Solar

00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:16.286 A:middle
System.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:18.026 A:middle
I'll be tackling the iOS bugs

00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:19.516 A:middle
first, and later on, Sebastian

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.076 A:middle
will come out and solve the

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.256 A:middle
macOS bugs.

00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:24.146 A:middle
Now, as it says, none of us are

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:25.476 A:middle
getting out of here to the Beer

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:26.876 A:middle
Bash until we fix all of these

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:28.706 A:middle
bugs, so there's nothing more

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:29.656 A:middle
exhilarating than peer

00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:31.236 A:middle
programming with 2000 people.

00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:34.066 A:middle
Let's get straight into it and

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.486 A:middle
start with the first bug.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.036 A:middle
The jump failure animation does

00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:38.226 A:middle
not match the specification.

00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:39.936 A:middle
So what's that talking about?

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:41.936 A:middle
Well, switching to the simulator

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:42.836 A:middle
because we're using the

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:44.486 A:middle
simulator to speed up debugging

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:45.596 A:middle
and development.

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:46.996 A:middle
I've wired up a tap just to

00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:48.466 A:middle
recognize them, so every time I

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:49.776 A:middle
tap the astronaut he performs a

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.156 A:middle
successful jump to the height of

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:51.856 A:middle
the bar.

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:53.886 A:middle
Now this bug is talking about

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:54.936 A:middle
the case where the astronaut

00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:55.866 A:middle
doesn't reach the height of the

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.096 A:middle
bar, so let's reproduce that.

00:04:57.856 --> 00:04:59.086 A:middle
Switching to the editor, I'm

00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:00.656 A:middle
going to use the jump bar to
