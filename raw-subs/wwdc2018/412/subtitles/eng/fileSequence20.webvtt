00:19:58.976 --> 00:20:00.096 A:middle
our expression and we can do

00:20:00.096 --> 00:20:01.596 A:middle
that by pressing the plus button

00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:03.446 A:middle
and adding another command

00:20:03.446 --> 00:20:03.786 A:middle
action.

00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:06.756 A:middle
Expression jump astronaut

00:20:06.756 --> 00:20:08.176 A:middle
animated false.

00:20:08.526 --> 00:20:09.566 A:middle
And we make this order

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:10.086 A:middle
continuing.

00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:11.806 A:middle
So what we've got here is a

00:20:11.806 --> 00:20:14.096 A:middle
breakpoint then when execution

00:20:14.096 --> 00:20:16.336 A:middle
reaches this line but before it

00:20:16.336 --> 00:20:17.526 A:middle
executes this line, the

00:20:17.856 --> 00:20:18.796 A:middle
breakpoint is triggered.

00:20:18.796 --> 00:20:20.686 A:middle
It will perform the command to

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.976 A:middle
jump over that line and then use

00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:25.196 A:middle
expression to call the function

00:20:25.196 --> 00:20:26.126 A:middle
call that we'd like to make

00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:26.966 A:middle
instead.

00:20:27.336 --> 00:20:28.936 A:middle
So now, if we tap on the

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.796 A:middle
astronaut, we can rapidly

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:31.936 A:middle
progress through the game state

00:20:31.936 --> 00:20:33.386 A:middle
and skip all the animations and

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:34.476 A:middle
easily reproduce our bug.

00:20:35.396 --> 00:20:36.656 A:middle
So, as I said, the game was

00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:38.646 A:middle
meant to end after 10 attempts,

00:20:38.646 --> 00:20:40.386 A:middle
and we've gone well beyond that,

00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:42.916 A:middle
so let's have a look at the game

00:20:42.916 --> 00:20:43.266 A:middle
state.

00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:45.836 A:middle
That is all stored in a property

00:20:45.836 --> 00:20:48.376 A:middle
up here called GamePlay, so I'm

00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:49.636 A:middle
going to set a breakpoint on

00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:51.736 A:middle
that property and start a new

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:52.016 A:middle
jump.

00:20:52.196 --> 00:20:53.906 A:middle
And now we've paused at the next

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:54.916 A:middle
reference to that property.

00:20:55.626 --> 00:20:56.926 A:middle
I'm going to use po to look at

00:20:56.976 --> 00:20:58.296 A:middle
the current state of that

00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:00.026 A:middle
object, and here we see the
