00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:00.656 A:middle
going to use the jump bar to

00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:02.296 A:middle
navigate to the jump function

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:03.986 A:middle
and set a breakpoint at the

00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:04.816 A:middle
start of that function.

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:06.786 A:middle
Now I'll tap the astronaut, and

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.576 A:middle
we'll start a jump and now we

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:09.646 A:middle
are paused in the debugger.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:11.876 A:middle
The first thing to point out is

00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:13.136 A:middle
actually up here in the tab bar.

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:14.876 A:middle
We now have four tabs.

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:16.226 A:middle
This debug tab was just created

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:18.096 A:middle
for us by Xcode, and for those

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:19.426 A:middle
of you that like working in tabs

00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.236 A:middle
like I do, this is an Xcode

00:05:21.236 --> 00:05:22.416 A:middle
behavior that you can define.

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:26.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:28.666 A:middle
So to do that you use the Xcode

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:30.356 A:middle
menu to edit behaviors and that

00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:32.246 A:middle
takes you to the preferences in

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:33.216 A:middle
the behavior's tab.

00:05:33.216 --> 00:05:34.796 A:middle
And here you can configure many

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:35.316 A:middle
behaviors.

00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:36.976 A:middle
In this case, you would need to

00:05:36.976 --> 00:05:38.966 A:middle
configure the pause's behavior

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:40.356 A:middle
in the running section.

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:41.866 A:middle
And this is the behavior that

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:44.666 A:middle
will be actioned when Xcode

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:45.526 A:middle
pauses in the debugger.

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:46.506 A:middle
So you can see here I've

00:05:46.506 --> 00:05:47.666 A:middle
configured it to show a tab

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:49.366 A:middle
named debug, and Xcode will

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:50.726 A:middle
always switch to that the tab

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:51.826 A:middle
when pausing in the debugger.

00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:53.486 A:middle
So that's great for users who

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.916 A:middle
like to work in tabs like I do.

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:56.726 A:middle
Now switching back to the code,

00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:57.446 A:middle
we can see that there's a

00:05:57.446 --> 00:05:58.876 A:middle
condition based on this property

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
did reach selected height, so
