00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:00.626 A:middle
in jump because we don't want to

00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:02.016 A:middle
modify did reach selected height

00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:02.396 A:middle
anymore.

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:03.496 A:middle
And now, when I tap the

00:17:03.496 --> 00:17:04.536 A:middle
astronaut, he performs a

00:17:04.536 --> 00:17:06.296 A:middle
successful jump, and we can see

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:07.376 A:middle
that all the labels update

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:08.766 A:middle
properly, so that bug looks

00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:09.836 A:middle
great to me.

00:17:10.955 --> 00:17:12.866 A:middle
So let's return and check that

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:13.175 A:middle
one off.

00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:14.556 A:middle
All right.

00:17:14.646 --> 00:17:16.215 A:middle
The next bug is a problem with

00:17:16.215 --> 00:17:17.256 A:middle
the end-of-game state.

00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:19.876 A:middle
So the game is meant to end

00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:21.096 A:middle
after 10 attempts, so I could

00:17:21.096 --> 00:17:22.606 A:middle
tap the astronaut, wait for the

00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:24.096 A:middle
animations to play out, and

00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:25.586 A:middle
progress through the game to get

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:26.576 A:middle
through that state to try and

00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:27.185 A:middle
reproduce it.

00:17:27.626 --> 00:17:28.676 A:middle
But the animations take some

00:17:28.676 --> 00:17:30.316 A:middle
time, and I may need to do this

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.316 A:middle
numerous times while I test and

00:17:32.316 --> 00:17:34.336 A:middle
verify my fixes, so I'd like to

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:36.156 A:middle
skip all the jump animations.

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:37.796 A:middle
So let me show you how I'll do

00:17:37.796 --> 00:17:37.906 A:middle
that.

00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:40.556 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to update

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:43.006 A:middle
UI for jump succeeded, and we

00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:45.596 A:middle
can see this function modifies

00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:47.316 A:middle
some colors and then calls jump

00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:48.596 A:middle
astronaut animated true.

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:50.066 A:middle
So it looks like I just need to

00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:51.286 A:middle
call jump astronaut animated

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:51.736 A:middle
false.

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:53.026 A:middle
I could change the code and

00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:54.106 A:middle
recompile, but like I said

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.546 A:middle
before, I don't like to change

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:56.826 A:middle
my code for debugging purposes

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.446 A:middle
if I can avoid it, so let me

00:17:58.446 --> 00:17:59.386 A:middle
show you the technique I'll use

00:17:59.386 --> 00:17:59.766 A:middle
instead.
