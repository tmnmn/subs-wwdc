00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:01.526 A:middle
So thanks for [inaudible] I hope

00:33:01.616 --> 00:33:02.616 A:middle
you enjoyed that and can use

00:33:02.616 --> 00:33:03.536 A:middle
these techniques in your

00:33:03.536 --> 00:33:04.536 A:middle
debugging sessions.

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:14.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:15.466 --> 00:33:17.396 A:middle
I'd just like to quickly recap

00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:19.556 A:middle
all of the features and tricks

00:33:19.556 --> 00:33:21.676 A:middle
that we went over during that

00:33:21.676 --> 00:33:22.416 A:middle
debug session.

00:33:22.806 --> 00:33:24.486 A:middle
So firstly, we looked at how we

00:33:24.486 --> 00:33:25.926 A:middle
can use Xcode behaviors to

00:33:25.926 --> 00:33:27.246 A:middle
dedicate attempt to debugging

00:33:27.586 --> 00:33:29.196 A:middle
and how to use LLDB expressions

00:33:29.196 --> 00:33:30.416 A:middle
to modify program state.

00:33:31.076 --> 00:33:32.526 A:middle
We can use auto-continuing

00:33:32.526 --> 00:33:33.486 A:middle
breakpoints with debugger

00:33:33.486 --> 00:33:35.136 A:middle
commands to inject code live,

00:33:35.696 --> 00:33:37.246 A:middle
and we can create dependent

00:33:37.246 --> 00:33:38.746 A:middle
breakpoint configurations using

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:40.696 A:middle
breakpoint set one shot as a

00:33:40.696 --> 00:33:42.056 A:middle
debugger command action for

00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:42.736 A:middle
another breakpoint.

00:33:43.536 --> 00:33:45.286 A:middle
Even when in assembly frames, we

00:33:45.286 --> 00:33:47.036 A:middle
can easily inspect the function

00:33:47.036 --> 00:33:48.626 A:middle
arguments using po dollar arg

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:49.766 A:middle
one, dollar arg two, et cetera,

00:33:50.256 --> 00:33:52.476 A:middle
and we can skip lines of code by

00:33:52.476 --> 00:33:53.726 A:middle
dragging the instruction pointer

00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:55.206 A:middle
or using the command thread

00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:55.446 A:middle
jump.

00:33:56.336 --> 00:33:57.736 A:middle
We can request that the debugger

00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:58.746 A:middle
pause when a variable is

00:33:58.746 --> 00:34:01.586 A:middle
modified using watchpoints, and
