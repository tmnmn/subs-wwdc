00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:01.246 A:middle
And since all those views

00:41:01.246 --> 00:41:02.776 A:middle
themselves don't have content,

00:41:03.146 --> 00:41:04.186 A:middle
we currently only show

00:41:04.186 --> 00:41:04.676 A:middle
wireframes.

00:41:05.356 --> 00:41:07.626 A:middle
So with the constraint selected,

00:41:08.016 --> 00:41:09.166 A:middle
let's take a look at the inspect

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:09.916 A:middle
on the right-hand side.

00:41:10.516 --> 00:41:12.696 A:middle
We can see that it aligns the

00:41:12.696 --> 00:41:14.006 A:middle
horizontal center of the image

00:41:14.006 --> 00:41:15.716 A:middle
view with the horizontal center

00:41:15.716 --> 00:41:17.126 A:middle
of the planet globe view and it

00:41:17.126 --> 00:41:18.916 A:middle
does so with a constant of zero.

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.536 A:middle
So it aligns it horizontally

00:41:20.536 --> 00:41:21.516 A:middle
centered in its super view.

00:41:22.606 --> 00:41:24.136 A:middle
Now let's select the planet

00:41:24.136 --> 00:41:26.186 A:middle
globe view from the debug

00:41:26.186 --> 00:41:27.756 A:middle
navigator, and we can see that

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:29.036 A:middle
it's a little bit larger towards

00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:30.826 A:middle
the left-hand side but it aligns

00:41:30.826 --> 00:41:31.526 A:middle
on the right-hand side.

00:41:31.526 --> 00:41:32.526 A:middle
So that's a little bit weird

00:41:32.526 --> 00:41:33.556 A:middle
because we just saw the

00:41:33.556 --> 00:41:34.746 A:middle
constraints aligning them

00:41:34.816 --> 00:41:36.326 A:middle
correctly or exactly

00:41:36.326 --> 00:41:38.486 A:middle
horizontally, but that's not

00:41:38.556 --> 00:41:39.556 A:middle
really what we see in the view

00:41:39.556 --> 00:41:39.866 A:middle
debugger.

00:41:40.146 --> 00:41:40.986 A:middle
So let's take a look at the

00:41:40.986 --> 00:41:42.666 A:middle
constraints of the planet globe

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.376 A:middle
view and see if we can

00:41:43.426 --> 00:41:45.286 A:middle
understand what's going on.

00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:46.416 A:middle
I'll select the leading

00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:47.956 A:middle
constraint here, and taking a

00:41:47.956 --> 00:41:49.476 A:middle
look at the inspect again, we

00:41:49.476 --> 00:41:50.526 A:middle
can see that it aligns the

00:41:50.526 --> 00:41:51.856 A:middle
leading edge of the planet globe

00:41:51.856 --> 00:41:53.696 A:middle
view with the leading edge of

00:41:53.806 --> 00:41:55.316 A:middle
the NS visual effect view, which

00:41:55.316 --> 00:41:56.446 A:middle
we saw in super view.

00:41:56.906 --> 00:41:58.656 A:middle
So it simply inserts it relative

00:41:58.656 --> 00:42:00.196 A:middle
to its super view and it does so
