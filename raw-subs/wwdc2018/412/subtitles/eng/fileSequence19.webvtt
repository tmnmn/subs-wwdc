00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:00.116 A:middle
But it's only risky because the

00:19:00.116 --> 00:19:01.456 A:middle
debugger allows you to move the

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:02.416 A:middle
instruction point wherever you

00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:02.736 A:middle
like.

00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:04.266 A:middle
It does not care, but it cannot

00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:05.766 A:middle
guarantee that the application's

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:06.876 A:middle
state will remain intact.

00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:08.326 A:middle
So you could, for example, cause

00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:10.096 A:middle
memory management issues if you

00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:11.376 A:middle
end up referencing an object

00:19:11.376 --> 00:19:12.146 A:middle
that has not yet been

00:19:12.146 --> 00:19:13.926 A:middle
initialized or over-releasing an

00:19:13.926 --> 00:19:14.756 A:middle
object, for example.

00:19:15.316 --> 00:19:16.826 A:middle
But we've all been to the

00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:17.956 A:middle
advanced debugging session now,

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:18.766 A:middle
so we know what we're doing.

00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:19.826 A:middle
So let's press the blue button.

00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:21.916 A:middle
All right.

00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.076 A:middle
So we've skipped over that line,

00:19:23.076 --> 00:19:24.336 A:middle
and now in the console, we can

00:19:24.336 --> 00:19:25.726 A:middle
use expression and call jump

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:26.986 A:middle
astronaut animated false.

00:19:28.816 --> 00:19:30.316 A:middle
And now we press continue to see

00:19:30.316 --> 00:19:32.956 A:middle
if all this worked, and indeed,

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:34.516 A:middle
the game state updated, and we

00:19:34.516 --> 00:19:35.826 A:middle
skipped all the jump animations.

00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:38.436 A:middle
So I'd like that to happen every

00:19:38.436 --> 00:19:40.256 A:middle
time I tap the astronaut, so I'm

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:41.186 A:middle
going to configure this

00:19:41.186 --> 00:19:42.446 A:middle
breakpoint here to do that for

00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:42.606 A:middle
me.

00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:45.156 A:middle
So first, we need a debugger

00:19:45.156 --> 00:19:47.556 A:middle
action that skips over one line,

00:19:47.716 --> 00:19:48.856 A:middle
and the command for that is

00:19:48.886 --> 00:19:49.536 A:middle
thread jump.

00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:51.426 A:middle
And I give it the option by one,

00:19:51.426 --> 00:19:52.916 A:middle
and this tells the debugger to

00:19:53.156 --> 00:19:55.486 A:middle
jump over one line of code for

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:55.976 A:middle
the current thread.

00:19:56.216 --> 00:19:58.976 A:middle
And then we just need to call

00:19:58.976 --> 00:20:00.096 A:middle
our expression and we can do
