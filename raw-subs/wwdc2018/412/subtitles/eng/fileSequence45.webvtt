00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:01.736 A:middle
You go to your scheme up here

00:45:01.736 --> 00:45:02.816 A:middle
and [inaudible] edit scheme.

00:45:03.836 --> 00:45:05.606 A:middle
And in the diagnostics tab of

00:45:05.656 --> 00:45:08.096 A:middle
the scheme options, under

00:45:08.096 --> 00:45:09.556 A:middle
logging, you can enable mailx

00:45:09.836 --> 00:45:11.396 A:middle
stack logging for all

00:45:11.396 --> 00:45:12.766 A:middle
allocations in prehistory.

00:45:13.606 --> 00:45:14.546 A:middle
And that will provide you with

00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:15.816 A:middle
these handy allocation

00:45:15.816 --> 00:45:17.076 A:middle
backtraces for all selected

00:45:17.076 --> 00:45:18.406 A:middle
objects in the view debugger as

00:45:18.436 --> 00:45:19.766 A:middle
well as in Xcode's memory graph

00:45:19.766 --> 00:45:20.016 A:middle
debugger.

00:45:21.146 --> 00:45:22.766 A:middle
Now, when I mouse over this

00:45:23.256 --> 00:45:24.866 A:middle
stackframe here, we can see the

00:45:24.866 --> 00:45:26.926 A:middle
full name of that frame.

00:45:27.596 --> 00:45:29.546 A:middle
And we can see that it is the

00:45:29.546 --> 00:45:30.886 A:middle
set up planet globe view layout

00:45:30.886 --> 00:45:31.966 A:middle
method in the scene view

00:45:31.966 --> 00:45:32.476 A:middle
controller.

00:45:33.496 --> 00:45:35.956 A:middle
And I can jump to these points

00:45:35.956 --> 00:45:37.706 A:middle
in code using this jump to

00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:38.086 A:middle
arrow.

00:45:38.906 --> 00:45:40.466 A:middle
And I will do so by holding down

00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:42.196 A:middle
shift control option, which

00:45:42.196 --> 00:45:44.096 A:middle
brings us this navigational

00:45:44.246 --> 00:45:45.006 A:middle
[inaudible] and allows me to

00:45:45.006 --> 00:45:46.776 A:middle
open this file in a separate

00:45:46.776 --> 00:45:47.056 A:middle
window.

00:45:47.586 --> 00:45:50.376 A:middle
Now you can see that the line of

00:45:50.486 --> 00:45:51.356 A:middle
code where the constraint is

00:45:51.356 --> 00:45:52.376 A:middle
allocated is highlighted.

00:45:52.896 --> 00:45:54.196 A:middle
We can see the constant of 30,

00:45:54.246 --> 00:45:55.526 A:middle
and I can invert it to negative

00:45:55.526 --> 00:45:55.836 A:middle
30.

00:45:56.526 --> 00:45:58.436 A:middle
I'll save this file and close it

00:45:58.436 --> 00:45:59.736 A:middle
and we're done with our first
