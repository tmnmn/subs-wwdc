00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:02.216 A:middle
Another failure case that some

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:03.766 A:middle
developers may have had was due

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.286 A:middle
to the debugger being unable to

00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:07.406 A:middle
materialize variable types while

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:07.826 A:middle
debugging.

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:09.946 A:middle
This would manifest itself in

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:11.216 A:middle
Xcode looking something like

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:11.626 A:middle
this.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:12.866 A:middle
Where on the left, you can see

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.486 A:middle
the variables' view shows all

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:15.586 A:middle
the names of the variables in

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:17.216 A:middle
the frame but there'd be no type

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.626 A:middle
information or values visible.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:19.966 A:middle
And attempts to print out the

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.086 A:middle
value of a variable would fail

00:02:22.086 --> 00:02:23.116 A:middle
with errors like these.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:26.216 A:middle
Now, thanks again, in big part

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:27.386 A:middle
to your bug reports, the team

00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:28.806 A:middle
has been able to track down and

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:30.706 A:middle
fix these many edge cases where

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:32.386 A:middle
debug information was not being

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.366 A:middle
reliably generated.

00:02:33.826 --> 00:02:34.916 A:middle
So I want to thank you guys on

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:36.326 A:middle
behalf of the team again for

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
filing issues when you've

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.246 A:middle
encountered any problems while

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:40.716 A:middle
debugging.

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:42.366 A:middle
And if you find any more

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.226 A:middle
problems with Xcode 10 while

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:45.696 A:middle
debugging a project, please

00:02:45.696 --> 00:02:47.136 A:middle
continue to file bug reports for

00:02:47.136 --> 00:02:47.376 A:middle
us.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.376 A:middle
For those of you at the

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:49.696 A:middle
conference, if you find a

00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:50.536 A:middle
problem with your project,

00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:51.776 A:middle
please come along to the labs.

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:54.236 A:middle
We have an Xcode debugging and

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:55.796 A:middle
profiling lab tomorrow morning

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:56.656 A:middle
from nine till 12.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:58.266 A:middle
Bring your project and ask for

00:02:58.266 --> 00:02:59.816 A:middle
an Xcode debugger engineer or an

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:01.106 A:middle
LLDB engineer, as they would
