00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.486 A:middle
constraint problem.

00:52:00.716 --> 00:52:03.236 A:middle
I showed you how to use the

00:52:03.236 --> 00:52:04.206 A:middle
object pointers that you can

00:52:04.206 --> 00:52:06.096 A:middle
easily access by just copying

00:52:06.096 --> 00:52:07.506 A:middle
the selected objects and use

00:52:07.506 --> 00:52:08.006 A:middle
them in LLDB.

00:52:08.006 --> 00:52:09.896 A:middle
We had a look at the creation

00:52:09.896 --> 00:52:11.866 A:middle
backtraces, which are available

00:52:11.866 --> 00:52:12.956 A:middle
if you have mailx stack logging

00:52:12.956 --> 00:52:14.276 A:middle
enabled in your scheme options

00:52:15.176 --> 00:52:16.316 A:middle
to jump right to the code and

00:52:16.316 --> 00:52:18.426 A:middle
applied a change that we needed

00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:19.226 A:middle
for our constraint.

00:52:19.876 --> 00:52:21.116 A:middle
We had a look at the debug

00:52:21.116 --> 00:52:22.686 A:middle
description that's conveniently

00:52:22.686 --> 00:52:23.936 A:middle
available in the inspector of

00:52:23.976 --> 00:52:24.556 A:middle
the view debugger.

00:52:25.426 --> 00:52:27.486 A:middle
And we had a look at click

00:52:27.486 --> 00:52:28.766 A:middle
through to select a view that

00:52:28.766 --> 00:52:29.656 A:middle
was behind another view.

00:52:30.106 --> 00:52:32.256 A:middle
And regarding debugging dark

00:52:32.256 --> 00:52:34.086 A:middle
mode, we saw that you can easily

00:52:34.346 --> 00:52:35.526 A:middle
override the appearance of the

00:52:35.526 --> 00:52:37.056 A:middle
target application right from

00:52:37.056 --> 00:52:38.316 A:middle
Xcode's debug bar or from the

00:52:38.316 --> 00:52:38.736 A:middle
touch bar.

00:52:39.706 --> 00:52:40.596 A:middle
I showed you how to capture a

00:52:40.596 --> 00:52:42.256 A:middle
Mac app in its active state.

00:52:42.346 --> 00:52:43.726 A:middle
And we had a look at the name

00:52:43.726 --> 00:52:44.856 A:middle
color information and its

00:52:44.856 --> 00:52:46.006 A:middle
appearance information that is

00:52:46.006 --> 00:52:47.446 A:middle
now available in Xcode's view

00:52:47.446 --> 00:52:48.246 A:middle
debugger inspector.

00:52:48.746 --> 00:52:50.426 A:middle
If you want to learn more about

00:52:50.426 --> 00:52:52.646 A:middle
adapting the dark mode in your

00:52:52.646 --> 00:52:54.226 A:middle
Mac application, please check

00:52:54.226 --> 00:52:55.536 A:middle
out the videos for these two

00:52:55.536 --> 00:52:55.926 A:middle
sessions.

00:52:57.046 --> 00:52:58.716 A:middle
That brings us to the end of

00:52:58.776 --> 00:52:59.246 A:middle
this talk.

00:52:59.906 --> 00:53:01.056 A:middle
