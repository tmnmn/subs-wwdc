00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:01.396 A:middle
think will fix the problem and

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:01.836 A:middle
make this an [inaudible]

00:09:01.836 --> 00:09:02.986 A:middle
continuing breakpoint.

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:04.406 A:middle
So what I've configured here,

00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:05.356 A:middle
even though I've made the change

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.096 A:middle
in the code, I haven't

00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:07.046 A:middle
recompiled, of course.

00:09:07.216 --> 00:09:09.036 A:middle
So I'm using the custom

00:09:09.036 --> 00:09:10.536 A:middle
breakpoint to inject that change

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.376 A:middle
for me so I can test it using

00:09:12.376 --> 00:09:13.916 A:middle
the current live application.

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:15.586 A:middle
So now, if I tap the astronaut,

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:17.076 A:middle
he performs this unsuccessful

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:18.626 A:middle
jump and falls over and stands

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:19.736 A:middle
back up again, so it looks like

00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:20.536 A:middle
we fixed the problem.

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:21.336 A:middle
I like this effect, so I'm going

00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:21.946 A:middle
to do it again.

00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:28.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:28.646 --> 00:09:30.496 A:middle
Now let me just launch notes

00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:30.966 A:middle
again.

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:34.126 A:middle
And we can tick off the first

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:35.966 A:middle
bug as fixed.

00:09:36.686 --> 00:09:38.116 A:middle
Nothing better than checking off

00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:38.956 A:middle
fixed bugs.

00:09:39.536 --> 00:09:40.736 A:middle
Now the next three bugs are to

00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:42.376 A:middle
do with the new GamePlay mode

00:09:42.376 --> 00:09:43.096 A:middle
I've been working on.

00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:44.446 A:middle
So I'm going to press play in

00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:45.656 A:middle
the simulator to show you that,

00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:47.316 A:middle
and the challenge here is to try

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:48.716 A:middle
and jump higher than the bar 10

00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:49.196 A:middle
times.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:50.726 A:middle
And the bar starts low and

00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:51.636 A:middle
raises each time.

00:09:53.156 --> 00:09:54.736 A:middle
And you can also see some score

00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:55.906 A:middle
labels have been added to the

00:09:55.906 --> 00:09:56.446 A:middle
top.

00:09:56.536 --> 00:09:57.736 A:middle
So if I tap the astronaut,

00:09:57.896 --> 00:09:58.966 A:middle
you'll see he's still configured

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.436 A:middle
to perform an unsuccessful jump,
