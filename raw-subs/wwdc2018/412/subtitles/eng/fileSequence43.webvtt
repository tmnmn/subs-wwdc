00:42:58.636 --> 00:43:00.226 A:middle
negative 30 to insert it towards

00:43:00.226 --> 00:43:00.806 A:middle
the left-hand side.

00:43:01.116 --> 00:43:03.246 A:middle
So what I want to do is I want

00:43:03.246 --> 00:43:04.576 A:middle
to try out that fix to invert

00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:05.126 A:middle
the constant.

00:43:05.126 --> 00:43:06.236 A:middle
I will make use of the same

00:43:06.236 --> 00:43:07.986 A:middle
technique that Chris introduced

00:43:07.986 --> 00:43:09.526 A:middle
earlier by simply applying it

00:43:09.666 --> 00:43:10.286 A:middle
through LLDB.

00:43:11.086 --> 00:43:13.096 A:middle
So, with this constraint

00:43:13.096 --> 00:43:19.026 A:middle
selected, I'll select edit,

00:43:19.286 --> 00:43:19.716 A:middle
copy.

00:43:20.396 --> 00:43:22.536 A:middle
And I will bring up the console

00:43:22.536 --> 00:43:24.416 A:middle
area at the bottom, and what

00:43:24.796 --> 00:43:27.916 A:middle
this copying gives me is the

00:43:28.236 --> 00:43:28.986 A:middle
[inaudible] pointer to the

00:43:28.986 --> 00:43:30.246 A:middle
selected object, and that works

00:43:30.246 --> 00:43:31.876 A:middle
for all objects that you select

00:43:31.876 --> 00:43:32.996 A:middle
in the view debugger as well as

00:43:32.996 --> 00:43:33.846 A:middle
in the memory graph debugger.

00:43:33.846 --> 00:43:35.306 A:middle
It makes it super convenient to

00:43:35.306 --> 00:43:36.166 A:middle
use them in the console.

00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:37.206 A:middle
So let's --

00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:41.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:42.116 --> 00:43:42.366 A:middle
Thank you.

00:43:43.326 --> 00:43:44.026 A:middle
Let's print the debug

00:43:44.026 --> 00:43:45.366 A:middle
description and we can confirm

00:43:45.366 --> 00:43:46.746 A:middle
that the constant is in fact

00:43:46.966 --> 00:43:47.726 A:middle
positive 30.

00:43:48.236 --> 00:43:49.596 A:middle
That's what we saw in the

00:43:49.596 --> 00:43:50.286 A:middle
inspector as well.

00:43:50.496 --> 00:43:52.236 A:middle
So let's set the constant to

00:43:52.236 --> 00:43:52.846 A:middle
negative 30.

00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:54.836 A:middle
I'll type e, which is the super

00:43:54.836 --> 00:43:57.076 A:middle
short form of expression by

00:43:57.076 --> 00:43:59.786 A:middle
casting the pointer and then say

00:43:59.786 --> 00:44:02.776 A:middle
set constant to negative 30.
