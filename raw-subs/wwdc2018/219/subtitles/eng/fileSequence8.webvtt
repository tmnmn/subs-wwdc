00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:00.446 A:middle
mentioned earlier, is

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.956 A:middle
proportional to the size of the

00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:02.786 A:middle
input image.

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:04.616 A:middle
Not necessarily, the size of the

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:05.946 A:middle
image view that's actually

00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:07.006 A:middle
rendered in the frame buffer.

00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:09.196 A:middle
And this can have some pretty

00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:10.346 A:middle
negative consequences on

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:11.026 A:middle
performance.

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:14.806 A:middle
The large allocation that is in

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.356 A:middle
your application's address space

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.356 A:middle
could force other related

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:20.896 A:middle
content apart from content that

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:21.876 A:middle
it wants to reference.

00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:23.436 A:middle
This is called fragmentation.

00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:27.476 A:middle
Eventually, if your application

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.116 A:middle
starts accumulating a lot of

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:30.956 A:middle
memory usage the operating

00:08:30.956 --> 00:08:32.326 A:middle
system will step in and start

00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:34.006 A:middle
transparently compressing the

00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:35.586 A:middle
content of physical memory.

00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:38.126 A:middle
Now, the CPU needs to be

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:39.946 A:middle
involved in this operation so in

00:08:39.946 --> 00:08:41.576 A:middle
addition to any CPU usage in

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:42.936 A:middle
your own application.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.326 A:middle
You could be increasing global

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:46.676 A:middle
CPU usage that you have no

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:47.336 A:middle
control over.

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:50.346 A:middle
Eventually, your application

00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:51.956 A:middle
could start consuming so much

00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:53.706 A:middle
physical memory that the OS

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:55.036 A:middle
needs to start terminating

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:55.816 A:middle
processes.

00:08:56.426 --> 00:08:57.756 A:middle
And it'll start with background

00:08:57.756 --> 00:08:59.186 A:middle
processes of low priority.

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.676 A:middle
And, eventually, if your
