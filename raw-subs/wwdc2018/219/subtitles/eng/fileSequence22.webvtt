00:22:00.016 --> 00:22:01.596 A:middle
UIImage and UIImageView.

00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:04.176 A:middle
But that's not all of the

00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:05.256 A:middle
graphical work that your

00:22:05.256 --> 00:22:06.006 A:middle
application does.

00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:07.316 A:middle
Sometimes, your application

00:22:07.616 --> 00:22:09.496 A:middle
draws content at runtime.

00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:13.586 A:middle
The example of this happening

00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:15.956 A:middle
might be seen in something like

00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:18.856 A:middle
this editing view in the Photos

00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:19.446 A:middle
application.

00:22:20.996 --> 00:22:23.236 A:middle
The UIButton that's displaying

00:22:23.536 --> 00:22:26.146 A:middle
an icon and UIButton can use

00:22:26.146 --> 00:22:27.176 A:middle
UIImageView directly.

00:22:28.376 --> 00:22:29.726 A:middle
But UIButton doesn't support the

00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:32.056 A:middle
style of this Live button, here,

00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:33.396 A:middle
that you can tap to enable or

00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:35.216 A:middle
disable the Live Photo.

00:22:36.256 --> 00:22:37.136 A:middle
So, we're going to have to do

00:22:37.136 --> 00:22:38.346 A:middle
some work here, ourselves.

00:22:38.486 --> 00:22:41.326 A:middle
And one implementation of this

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.606 A:middle
might be to subclass UIView and

00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:44.606 A:middle
implement the draw method.

00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:47.226 A:middle
And this implementation here

00:22:47.586 --> 00:22:49.716 A:middle
draws a yellow roundRect, draws

00:22:49.716 --> 00:22:51.276 A:middle
some text, and an image on top

00:22:51.916 --> 00:22:53.366 A:middle
of it.

00:22:53.626 --> 00:22:55.036 A:middle
Don't recommend this approach

00:22:55.866 --> 00:22:57.156 A:middle
for a couple of reasons.

00:22:58.066 --> 00:23:01.256 A:middle
Let's compare this view subclass
