00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:02.646 A:middle
And inside of our implementation

00:18:02.696 --> 00:18:05.436 A:middle
of the prefetch method we're

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:06.906 A:middle
going to asynchronously dispatch

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:07.416 A:middle
to that queue.

00:18:07.416 --> 00:18:09.216 A:middle
Now, it does mean that an

00:18:09.216 --> 00:18:10.876 A:middle
individual image might not start

00:18:10.876 --> 00:18:12.316 A:middle
making progress until later than

00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:12.776 A:middle
before.

00:18:13.576 --> 00:18:15.006 A:middle
But it also means that the CPU

00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:16.356 A:middle
is going to spend less time

00:18:17.086 --> 00:18:18.506 A:middle
switching between bits of work

00:18:18.506 --> 00:18:21.356 A:middle
that it can do.

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:22.376 A:middle
Now, these images that we're

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:23.316 A:middle
displaying can come from a

00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:24.326 A:middle
number of places.

00:18:25.086 --> 00:18:26.416 A:middle
They might come with our

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:28.706 A:middle
application, in which case they

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:29.686 A:middle
might be stored in an image

00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:30.126 A:middle
asset.

00:18:30.566 --> 00:18:31.456 A:middle
Or they might be stored in a

00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:32.776 A:middle
file instead of our application

00:18:32.776 --> 00:18:33.146 A:middle
wrapper.

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:34.696 A:middle
Or they could come from the

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:35.146 A:middle
network.

00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:37.586 A:middle
Or they could be in a document

00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:39.436 A:middle
that's stored in the application

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:40.446 A:middle
documents directory.

00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:42.646 A:middle
They could be stored in a cache.

00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:45.086 A:middle
But for artwork that comes with

00:18:45.086 --> 00:18:47.506 A:middle
your application, we strongly

00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:49.416 A:middle
encourage you to use image

00:18:49.416 --> 00:18:49.986 A:middle
assets.

00:18:50.916 --> 00:18:52.016 A:middle
And there are a number of

00:18:52.016 --> 00:18:52.736 A:middle
reasons why.

00:18:54.526 --> 00:18:56.436 A:middle
Image assets are optimized for

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:57.836 A:middle
name based and trait-based

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:58.226 A:middle
lookup.

00:18:58.606 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
It's faster to look up an image
