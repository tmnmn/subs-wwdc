00:19:58.266 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
If you turn on dynamic type to a

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:01.956 A:middle
very large size in the

00:20:01.956 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
Accessibility settings.

00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:05.596 A:middle
And then you tap and hold on an

00:20:05.596 --> 00:20:07.606 A:middle
item in the tab bar a little HUD

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:10.286 A:middle
shows up as a magnified view of

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.886 A:middle
the item that you're currently

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:12.786 A:middle
holding your finger over.

00:20:14.086 --> 00:20:16.056 A:middle
So, if you want your artwork to

00:20:16.056 --> 00:20:18.086 A:middle
look good in places like this

00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:19.856 A:middle
check the Preserve Vector

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:21.716 A:middle
Artwork checkbox in.

00:20:21.716 --> 00:20:22.056 A:middle
I'm sorry.

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:22.866 A:middle
The Preserve Vector Data

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:24.846 A:middle
checkbox in the image asset

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:25.886 A:middle
inspector.

00:20:26.536 --> 00:20:27.786 A:middle
Now, the way this works is very

00:20:27.786 --> 00:20:29.486 A:middle
similar to the pipeline we saw

00:20:29.486 --> 00:20:29.936 A:middle
before.

00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:32.726 A:middle
Rather than a decode phase, we

00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:34.686 A:middle
have a rasterize phase that's

00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:35.796 A:middle
responsible for taking the

00:20:35.796 --> 00:20:38.586 A:middle
vector data and turning it into

00:20:38.586 --> 00:20:39.976 A:middle
bitmap data that can be copied

00:20:39.976 --> 00:20:40.786 A:middle
to the frame buffer.

00:20:45.046 --> 00:20:46.036 A:middle
Now, if we had to do this for

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.026 A:middle
all of the vector artwork in

00:20:47.026 --> 00:20:48.786 A:middle
your application we would be

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:50.586 A:middle
consuming a lot more CPU.

00:20:50.856 --> 00:20:52.006 A:middle
So, there's an optimization we

00:20:52.006 --> 00:20:52.476 A:middle
make here.

00:20:53.156 --> 00:20:55.096 A:middle
If you have an image that has

00:20:55.096 --> 00:20:56.456 A:middle
Preserve Vector Data checked,

00:20:57.266 --> 00:20:58.906 A:middle
but you render it at the normal

00:20:58.906 --> 00:20:59.386 A:middle
size.

00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:02.686 A:middle
The asset catalog compiler has,
