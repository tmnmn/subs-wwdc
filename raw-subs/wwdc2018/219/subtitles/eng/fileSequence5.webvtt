00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:00.616 A:middle
fixed interval.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:03.376 A:middle
It can happen at 60 fps.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:05.836 A:middle
So, every 1/60th of a second.

00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:08.006 A:middle
Or on an iPad with ProMotion

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.496 A:middle
Display, it can happen as fast

00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:11.936 A:middle
as every 1/120th of a second.

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:15.156 A:middle
And if nothing's changed in your

00:05:15.156 --> 00:05:16.586 A:middle
application, the display

00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:17.976 A:middle
hardware will get the same data

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:19.546 A:middle
back out of the frame buffer

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:20.926 A:middle
that it saw, previously.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:25.326 A:middle
But as you change the content of

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:26.456 A:middle
the views in your application,

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:28.226 A:middle
for example, you assign a new

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:29.906 A:middle
UIImage to our image view, here.

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:32.826 A:middle
UIKit will re-render your

00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:34.366 A:middle
application's window into the

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:34.986 A:middle
frame buffer.

00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:36.786 A:middle
And the next time the display

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:37.926 A:middle
hardware pulls from the frame

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:39.406 A:middle
buffer it'll get your new

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:39.946 A:middle
content.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:43.036 A:middle
Now, you can contrast an image

00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:44.606 A:middle
buffer to another kind of

00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:46.376 A:middle
buffer, a data buffer, which is

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:47.896 A:middle
just a buffer that contains a

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:48.846 A:middle
sequence of bytes.

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:51.116 A:middle
In our case, we're concerned

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.026 A:middle
about data buffers that contain

00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:54.306 A:middle
image files.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:55.606 A:middle
Perhaps, we've downloaded them

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.366 A:middle
from the network or we've loaded

00:05:57.366 --> 00:05:58.586 A:middle
them from disk.

00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
A data buffer that contains an
