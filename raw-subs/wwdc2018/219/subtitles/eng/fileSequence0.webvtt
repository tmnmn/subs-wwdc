&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:27.516 A:middle
Welcome to Image and Graphics

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:28.366 A:middle
Best Practices.

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:29.626 A:middle
My name's Kyle.

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:30.806 A:middle
I work on UIKit.

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.235 A:middle
And today, I'm going to be

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:33.796 A:middle
sharing with you some techniques

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:35.066 A:middle
and some strategies for

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.056 A:middle
efficiently working with

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:37.866 A:middle
graphical content in your

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.596 A:middle
applications.

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:40.516 A:middle
We're going to take a tour of

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:41.456 A:middle
the framework stack.

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.146 A:middle
First, we're going to start with

00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:45.646 A:middle
UIImage and UIImageView, which

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:48.146 A:middle
are UIKit's high level tools for

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:49.446 A:middle
working with graphical content

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.076 A:middle
in your app.

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.316 A:middle
Then, we're going to focus on

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.236 A:middle
how you can best do custom

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:55.666 A:middle
drawing inside of your

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.946 A:middle
applications with UIKit.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.996 A:middle
And finally, we're going to

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:00.786 A:middle
touch, briefly, on integrating
