00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:00.786 A:middle
touch, briefly, on integrating

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:02.806 A:middle
advanced CPU and GPU

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:04.516 A:middle
technologies into your

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:05.296 A:middle
applications.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.626 A:middle
And throughout this talk we're

00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:09.336 A:middle
going to be focusing primarily

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.706 A:middle
on our use of two scarce

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:14.116 A:middle
resources on the device; memory

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:15.336 A:middle
and CPU.

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:17.216 A:middle
And we tend to think of these

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:19.296 A:middle
things as separate quantities.

00:01:19.636 --> 00:01:20.716 A:middle
They have their own tracks in

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:21.746 A:middle
the debug navigator.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:23.966 A:middle
They have their own instruments

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.336 A:middle
in the instruments application.

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:27.406 A:middle
But really, they're intricately

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:27.786 A:middle
linked.

00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:31.736 A:middle
And it might be apparent that as

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:34.206 A:middle
your application uses more CPU,

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:36.406 A:middle
that has a negative impact on

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:38.116 A:middle
the battery life and the

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:39.076 A:middle
responsiveness of your

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:39.706 A:middle
application.

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:42.146 A:middle
But what might be less obvious

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.876 A:middle
is that as your application and

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:46.426 A:middle
other applications on the system

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:49.306 A:middle
consume more memory, that also

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:51.236 A:middle
causes more CPU utilization.

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:52.966 A:middle
Which, has further detrimental

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:55.046 A:middle
effects on battery life and

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:55.546 A:middle
performance.

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:57.216 A:middle
So, we're going to focus on how

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.406 A:middle
to improve our use of these

00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.006 A:middle
resources.

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:03.006 A:middle
What better context for
