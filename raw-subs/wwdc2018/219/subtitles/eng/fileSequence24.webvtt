00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:00.336 A:middle
this UI.

00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:02.676 A:middle
The backing store that we're

00:24:02.676 --> 00:24:04.746 A:middle
using here, the image buffer

00:24:04.746 --> 00:24:06.506 A:middle
that's attached to the CALayer,

00:24:06.886 --> 00:24:08.216 A:middle
the size of that is proportional

00:24:08.576 --> 00:24:09.256 A:middle
to the view that we're

00:24:09.256 --> 00:24:09.826 A:middle
displaying.

00:24:11.146 --> 00:24:12.266 A:middle
Now, one new feature and

00:24:12.266 --> 00:24:13.746 A:middle
optimization that we have in iOS

00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:16.786 A:middle
12 is that the size of the

00:24:16.786 --> 00:24:18.976 A:middle
elements in that backing store

00:24:19.406 --> 00:24:21.206 A:middle
will, actually, grow dynamically

00:24:21.596 --> 00:24:22.456 A:middle
depending on whether you're

00:24:22.456 --> 00:24:24.006 A:middle
drawing any color content.

00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:25.596 A:middle
And whether that color content

00:24:25.596 --> 00:24:27.286 A:middle
is within or outside of the

00:24:27.286 --> 00:24:28.426 A:middle
standard color range.

00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:30.356 A:middle
So, if you're drawing wide color

00:24:30.356 --> 00:24:32.516 A:middle
content using extended SRGB

00:24:32.516 --> 00:24:34.856 A:middle
colors, the backing store will,

00:24:34.856 --> 00:24:37.586 A:middle
actually, be larger than the

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:38.896 A:middle
backing store would be if you

00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:41.276 A:middle
used only colors within the zero

00:24:41.276 --> 00:24:42.036 A:middle
to one range.

00:24:42.516 --> 00:24:45.766 A:middle
Now, in previous versions of

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:47.626 A:middle
iOS, you could set the contents

00:24:47.626 --> 00:24:49.876 A:middle
format property on CALayer as a

00:24:49.876 --> 00:24:51.416 A:middle
hint to Core Animation saying,

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:52.836 A:middle
''I know I am not going to need

00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:54.496 A:middle
to support wide color content in

00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:56.026 A:middle
this view'', or, ''I know I am

00:24:56.026 --> 00:24:57.136 A:middle
going to need to support wide

00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:58.256 A:middle
color content in this view''.

00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
Now, if you do this, you're
