00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
Now, if you do this, you're

00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:01.556 A:middle
actually going to be disabling

00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.726 A:middle
the optimization that we

00:25:03.726 --> 00:25:04.906 A:middle
introduced in iOS 12.

00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:07.456 A:middle
So, check your implementations

00:25:07.456 --> 00:25:08.456 A:middle
of layerWillDraw.

00:25:08.806 --> 00:25:10.016 A:middle
Make sure you're not going to

00:25:10.016 --> 00:25:10.926 A:middle
accidentally defeat an

00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:12.236 A:middle
optimization that could benefit

00:25:12.236 --> 00:25:13.916 A:middle
your code when running on iOS

00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:14.236 A:middle
12.

00:25:16.696 --> 00:25:19.376 A:middle
But we can do better than just

00:25:19.646 --> 00:25:21.786 A:middle
hinting at whether we need a

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.106 A:middle
wide color capable backing

00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:23.446 A:middle
store.

00:25:23.836 --> 00:25:25.146 A:middle
We can, actually, reduce the

00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:26.386 A:middle
total amount of backing storage

00:25:26.386 --> 00:25:27.636 A:middle
that our application needs.

00:25:27.636 --> 00:25:29.616 A:middle
We can do that by refactoring

00:25:29.676 --> 00:25:31.526 A:middle
this larger view into smaller

00:25:31.526 --> 00:25:32.206 A:middle
subviews.

00:25:32.926 --> 00:25:34.586 A:middle
And reducing or eliminating

00:25:34.656 --> 00:25:36.026 A:middle
places that override the draw

00:25:36.026 --> 00:25:36.496 A:middle
function.

00:25:37.016 --> 00:25:39.306 A:middle
This will help us eliminate

00:25:39.306 --> 00:25:40.806 A:middle
duplicate copies of image data

00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:42.016 A:middle
that exist in memory.

00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:43.966 A:middle
And it will allow us to use

00:25:43.966 --> 00:25:46.256 A:middle
optimized properties of UIView

00:25:46.256 --> 00:25:47.336 A:middle
that don't require a backing

00:25:47.336 --> 00:25:47.706 A:middle
store.

00:25:48.236 --> 00:25:52.246 A:middle
So, as I mentioned, overriding

00:25:52.246 --> 00:25:53.776 A:middle
the draw method will require

00:25:53.776 --> 00:25:55.206 A:middle
creating a backing store to go

00:25:55.206 --> 00:25:56.056 A:middle
with your CALayer.

00:25:56.526 --> 00:25:58.286 A:middle
But some of the properties in

00:25:58.286 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
UIView can still work, even if
