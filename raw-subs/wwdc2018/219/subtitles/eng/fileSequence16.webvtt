00:15:58.296 --> 00:16:03.076 A:middle
The consequences of this are

00:16:03.076 --> 00:16:04.526 A:middle
that your application is more

00:16:04.526 --> 00:16:07.056 A:middle
responsive and the device has a

00:16:07.056 --> 00:16:07.956 A:middle
longer battery life.

00:16:08.466 --> 00:16:10.816 A:middle
So, to put this in action here,

00:16:11.476 --> 00:16:13.626 A:middle
we've got a implementation of

00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:15.086 A:middle
the prefetch method on our data

00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:15.516 A:middle
source.

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:17.436 A:middle
And it's going to call our

00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:19.726 A:middle
helper function to produce a

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:23.086 A:middle
downsampled version of the image

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.096 A:middle
that we're about to display in

00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:25.396 A:middle
this CollectionView cell.

00:16:25.826 --> 00:16:28.926 A:middle
And it does this by dispatching

00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:30.916 A:middle
work to one of the global

00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:31.856 A:middle
asynchronous queues.

00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:34.006 A:middle
Great.

00:16:34.006 --> 00:16:34.716 A:middle
Our work is happening in the

00:16:34.716 --> 00:16:35.166 A:middle
background.

00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:36.466 A:middle
This is what we wanted to do.

00:16:37.506 --> 00:16:39.786 A:middle
But there is a potential flaw

00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:40.056 A:middle
here.

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:42.486 A:middle
And it's a phenomenon that we

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:43.616 A:middle
like to call thread explosion.

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:46.046 A:middle
And this is what happens when we

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:47.656 A:middle
ask the system to do more work

00:16:47.886 --> 00:16:50.486 A:middle
than there are CPUs available to

00:16:50.846 --> 00:16:51.376 A:middle
do it.

00:16:51.436 --> 00:16:52.326 A:middle
If we're going to display a

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.246 A:middle
whole number of images, like 6-8

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.836 A:middle
images at a time, but we're

00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:56.956 A:middle
running on a device that only

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.746 A:middle
has 2 CPUs, we can't do all of

00:16:59.746 --> 00:17:00.966 A:middle
that work at once.
