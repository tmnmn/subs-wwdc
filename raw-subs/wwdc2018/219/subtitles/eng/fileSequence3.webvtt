00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:01.286 A:middle
And these objects in their roles

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:02.726 A:middle
as model and view, have

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.236 A:middle
traditional responsibilities.

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.736 A:middle
UIImage is responsible for

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:07.816 A:middle
loading image content.

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:09.856 A:middle
And UIImageView is responsible

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.586 A:middle
for displaying it, for rendering

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
it.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:14.336 A:middle
Now, we can think of this as a

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:15.836 A:middle
simple relationship that we

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:16.866 A:middle
establish once.

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.336 A:middle
It's a one-way relationship.

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:20.956 A:middle
Bu the actual story is a little

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:21.896 A:middle
bit more complicated.

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.146 A:middle
In addition to rendering being a

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:26.476 A:middle
continuous process, rather than

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:28.706 A:middle
a one-time event, there's this

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:29.706 A:middle
hidden phase.

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:31.786 A:middle
It's really important to

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.096 A:middle
understand in order to measure

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:33.826 A:middle
the performance of your

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:34.416 A:middle
application.

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:35.916 A:middle
And this phase is called

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:36.476 A:middle
decoding.

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:38.576 A:middle
But in order to discuss

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:40.326 A:middle
decoding, I first need to

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:41.646 A:middle
discuss a concept called a

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:42.016 A:middle
buffer.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.976 A:middle
A buffer is just a contiguous

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:45.866 A:middle
region of memory.

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:47.476 A:middle
But we tend to use the term

00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:49.036 A:middle
buffer when we're discussing

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:50.696 A:middle
memory that's composed of a

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:53.196 A:middle
sequence of elements of the same

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.286 A:middle
size, usually, of the same

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:56.446 A:middle
internal construction.

00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:59.366 A:middle
And for our purposes, one really

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.266 A:middle
important kind of buffer is an
