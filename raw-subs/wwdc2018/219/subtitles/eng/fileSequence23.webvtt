00:22:58.066 --> 00:23:01.256 A:middle
Let's compare this view subclass

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:03.366 A:middle
to our UIImageView.

00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:05.116 A:middle
Now, as you may already be

00:23:05.116 --> 00:23:07.556 A:middle
aware, every UIView is,

00:23:07.556 --> 00:23:09.446 A:middle
actually, backed by a CALayer in

00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:10.546 A:middle
the Core Animation runtime.

00:23:11.496 --> 00:23:13.426 A:middle
And for our image view, the

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:15.416 A:middle
image view creates the, asks the

00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:17.096 A:middle
image to create the decoded

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:17.736 A:middle
image buffer.

00:23:18.476 --> 00:23:20.366 A:middle
And then, hands that decoded

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:23.216 A:middle
image over to CALayer to use as

00:23:23.216 --> 00:23:24.366 A:middle
the content of its layer.

00:23:25.556 --> 00:23:27.296 A:middle
For our custom view that

00:23:27.296 --> 00:23:30.546 A:middle
overrode draw, it's similar, but

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:31.476 A:middle
slightly different.

00:23:31.686 --> 00:23:32.886 A:middle
The layers responsible for

00:23:32.886 --> 00:23:34.876 A:middle
creating an image buffer to hold

00:23:34.876 --> 00:23:36.636 A:middle
the contents of our draw method,

00:23:36.766 --> 00:23:39.586 A:middle
and then our view, excuses draw

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:42.176 A:middle
function and populates the

00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:43.266 A:middle
contents of that image buffer.

00:23:43.636 --> 00:23:45.116 A:middle
Which is then, copied into the

00:23:45.116 --> 00:23:47.256 A:middle
frame buffer as needed by the

00:23:47.256 --> 00:23:47.906 A:middle
display hardware.

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:56.116 A:middle
In order to understand how much

00:23:56.116 --> 00:23:57.376 A:middle
this is costing us and why we

00:23:57.376 --> 00:23:58.306 A:middle
should, perhaps, pursue

00:23:58.306 --> 00:23:59.746 A:middle
alternative ways of implementing

00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:00.336 A:middle
this UI.
