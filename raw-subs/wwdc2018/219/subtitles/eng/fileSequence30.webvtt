00:29:59.456 --> 00:30:02.456 A:middle
color space that required values

00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:04.786 A:middle
outside of the range of SRGB.

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:07.906 A:middle
But doesn't, actually, require a

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:09.676 A:middle
larger element size to store

00:30:09.676 --> 00:30:10.456 A:middle
that information.

00:30:10.936 --> 00:30:13.776 A:middle
So, UIImage has a image renderer

00:30:13.776 --> 00:30:15.726 A:middle
format property that you can use

00:30:15.766 --> 00:30:16.106 A:middle
to get a

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.986 A:middle
UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat

00:30:17.986 --> 00:30:19.826 A:middle
object preconstructed for

00:30:19.826 --> 00:30:21.916 A:middle
optimal storage of re-rendering

00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:22.436 A:middle
that image.

00:30:27.046 --> 00:30:27.836 A:middle
Lastly, we're going to talk a

00:30:27.836 --> 00:30:28.876 A:middle
little bit about how to

00:30:28.876 --> 00:30:31.276 A:middle
integrate advanced CPU and GPU

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.726 A:middle
technologies that we provide in

00:30:32.726 --> 00:30:35.046 A:middle
iOS into your applications.

00:30:36.416 --> 00:30:38.876 A:middle
So, if you've got a lot of

00:30:38.876 --> 00:30:40.586 A:middle
advanced processing to do to

00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:42.416 A:middle
your images, perhaps, in real

00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:44.786 A:middle
time, consider using Core Image.

00:30:46.016 --> 00:30:48.426 A:middle
Core Image is a framework that

00:30:48.426 --> 00:30:49.826 A:middle
allows you to create a recipe

00:30:49.826 --> 00:30:51.826 A:middle
for processing an image and

00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:53.966 A:middle
handle that on the CPU or on the

00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:54.516 A:middle
GPU.

00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:57.226 A:middle
If you create a UIImage from a

00:30:57.226 --> 00:30:59.366 A:middle
CIImage and hand that to

00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:01.666 A:middle
UIImageView, UIImageView will
