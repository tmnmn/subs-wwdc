00:27:58.826 --> 00:28:00.026 A:middle
that copy operation.

00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:02.046 A:middle
Rather than having to hold on to

00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:03.476 A:middle
a separate copy of your image

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:06.036 A:middle
with your solid color applied to

00:28:07.666 --> 00:28:07.746 A:middle
it.

00:28:08.006 --> 00:28:09.246 A:middle
Another optimization built into

00:28:09.246 --> 00:28:12.626 A:middle
UIKit provided view, UILabel is

00:28:12.626 --> 00:28:16.046 A:middle
able to use 75% less memory when

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:18.486 A:middle
displaying monochrome text than

00:28:18.486 --> 00:28:19.756 A:middle
when displaying color text or

00:28:19.756 --> 00:28:20.336 A:middle
emojis.

00:28:21.496 --> 00:28:22.786 A:middle
If you want to know more about

00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:24.136 A:middle
how this optimization works in

00:28:24.136 --> 00:28:25.936 A:middle
detail and how to apply it to

00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:27.306 A:middle
your custom subclasses of

00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:29.736 A:middle
UIView, check out the iOS Memory

00:28:29.736 --> 00:28:30.786 A:middle
Deep Dive session.

00:28:31.356 --> 00:28:32.616 A:middle
Goes into great detail about

00:28:32.616 --> 00:28:34.636 A:middle
this backing store format called

00:28:35.186 --> 00:28:35.253 A:middle
A8.

00:28:38.306 --> 00:28:39.646 A:middle
Sometimes, you want to render

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:44.256 A:middle
artwork offscreen stored in an

00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:45.506 A:middle
image buffer in memory.

00:28:45.736 --> 00:28:47.536 A:middle
And the class UIKit provides to

00:28:47.536 --> 00:28:48.376 A:middle
do that is

00:28:48.376 --> 00:28:49.826 A:middle
UIGraphicsImageRenderer.

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:52.036 A:middle
There's another function that's

00:28:52.036 --> 00:28:52.456 A:middle
older;

00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:55.116 A:middle
UIGraphicsBeginImageContext.

00:28:55.446 --> 00:28:56.656 A:middle
But please, don't use that.

00:28:57.076 --> 00:28:58.386 A:middle
Because only Graphics Image

00:28:58.386 --> 00:29:00.186 A:middle
Renderer is capable of correctly
