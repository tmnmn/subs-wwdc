00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:00.366 A:middle
file at this URL.

00:11:01.746 --> 00:11:03.546 A:middle
Don't go ahead and decode this

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:04.476 A:middle
image immediately.

00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:05.716 A:middle
Just create an object that

00:11:05.716 --> 00:11:06.236 A:middle
represents.

00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:07.676 A:middle
We're going to need information

00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:08.636 A:middle
from this URL.

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:12.336 A:middle
Then, we're going to calculate

00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:14.076 A:middle
on the horizontal and vertical

00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:14.676 A:middle
axis.

00:11:14.976 --> 00:11:16.166 A:middle
Based on the scale that we're

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:18.116 A:middle
going and point size we're going

00:11:18.116 --> 00:11:20.356 A:middle
to render at, which is the

00:11:20.356 --> 00:11:21.756 A:middle
larger dimension in pixels.

00:11:22.656 --> 00:11:24.806 A:middle
Calculate that information, and

00:11:24.806 --> 00:11:25.706 A:middle
then create an options

00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:27.386 A:middle
dictionary for our thumbnail.

00:11:28.286 --> 00:11:29.186 A:middle
There are a couple of options

00:11:29.186 --> 00:11:29.806 A:middle
listed here.

00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:30.646 A:middle
You can look in the

00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:32.246 A:middle
documentation for exactly what

00:11:32.246 --> 00:11:32.886 A:middle
these options do.

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:34.856 A:middle
But the very important one is

00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:37.026 A:middle
this CacheImmediately option.

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:39.936 A:middle
By passing this option here,

00:11:40.246 --> 00:11:41.946 A:middle
we're telling Core Graphics that

00:11:42.126 --> 00:11:43.456 A:middle
when I ask you to create the

00:11:43.456 --> 00:11:45.376 A:middle
thumbnail that's the exact

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:47.126 A:middle
moment you should create the

00:11:47.126 --> 00:11:48.446 A:middle
decoded image buffer for me.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.186 A:middle
So, we have exact control over

00:11:51.186 --> 00:11:52.616 A:middle
when we take that CPU hit for

00:11:52.616 --> 00:11:53.076 A:middle
decoding.

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:57.746 A:middle
Then, we create the thumbnail,

00:11:57.746 --> 00:11:59.856 A:middle
which is a CGImage, that we get

00:11:59.856 --> 00:12:00.166 A:middle
back.
