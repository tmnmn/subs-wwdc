00:18:58.606 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
It's faster to look up an image

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:01.756 A:middle
asset in the asset catalog, than

00:19:01.756 --> 00:19:03.146 A:middle
it is to search for files on

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:04.286 A:middle
disk that have a certain naming

00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:04.636 A:middle
scheme.

00:19:05.096 --> 00:19:08.246 A:middle
The asset catalog runtime has,

00:19:08.246 --> 00:19:10.046 A:middle
also, got some really good

00:19:10.046 --> 00:19:11.556 A:middle
smarts in it for managing buffer

00:19:11.556 --> 00:19:12.096 A:middle
sizes.

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:14.566 A:middle
And there are, also, some

00:19:14.566 --> 00:19:16.026 A:middle
features unrelated to runtime

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:17.876 A:middle
performance that are exclusive

00:19:17.876 --> 00:19:18.766 A:middle
to image assets.

00:19:19.086 --> 00:19:20.326 A:middle
Including features like per

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.776 A:middle
device thinning, which mean that

00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:23.306 A:middle
your application only downloads

00:19:23.616 --> 00:19:24.626 A:middle
image resources that are

00:19:24.626 --> 00:19:25.876 A:middle
relevant to the device that it's

00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:27.886 A:middle
going to run on and vector

00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:28.396 A:middle
artwork.

00:19:30.416 --> 00:19:32.076 A:middle
The vector artwork was a feature

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:33.546 A:middle
that was introduced in iOS 11.

00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:34.876 A:middle
And you enable it by checking

00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:36.196 A:middle
the Preserve Vector Data

00:19:36.616 --> 00:19:38.576 A:middle
checkbox in the editor for your

00:19:38.576 --> 00:19:39.246 A:middle
image asset.

00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:41.896 A:middle
And the upshot of this is that

00:19:42.046 --> 00:19:43.496 A:middle
if your image gets rendered in

00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:45.236 A:middle
an image view that is larger or

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.476 A:middle
smaller than the native size of

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:48.266 A:middle
the image it doesn't get blurry.

00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:50.456 A:middle
The image is, actually,

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:51.966 A:middle
re-rasterized from the vector

00:19:51.966 --> 00:19:53.586 A:middle
artwork so that it has nice

00:19:53.586 --> 00:19:54.416 A:middle
crisp edges.

00:19:55.686 --> 00:19:57.076 A:middle
One place that we use this in

00:19:57.076 --> 00:19:57.956 A:middle
the operating system.

00:19:58.266 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
If you turn on dynamic type to a
