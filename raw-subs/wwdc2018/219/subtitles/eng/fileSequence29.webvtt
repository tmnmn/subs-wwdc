00:28:58.386 --> 00:29:00.186 A:middle
Renderer is capable of correctly

00:29:00.186 --> 00:29:02.146 A:middle
rendering wide color content.

00:29:02.186 --> 00:29:04.646 A:middle
What you can do in your

00:29:04.646 --> 00:29:05.716 A:middle
applications is use

00:29:05.716 --> 00:29:07.466 A:middle
UIGraphicsImageRenderer to

00:29:07.466 --> 00:29:08.946 A:middle
render to an offscreen place.

00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:10.586 A:middle
And then, use UIImageView to

00:29:10.586 --> 00:29:12.446 A:middle
display that, efficiently, on

00:29:12.446 --> 00:29:12.886 A:middle
the screen.

00:29:14.756 --> 00:29:16.496 A:middle
Similarly, to the optimization

00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:19.406 A:middle
that we've introduced in CALayer

00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:20.336 A:middle
backing stores.

00:29:20.626 --> 00:29:22.126 A:middle
We've, also, made

00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:24.246 A:middle
UIGraphicsImageRenderer capable

00:29:24.246 --> 00:29:25.946 A:middle
of dynamically growing the size

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:27.456 A:middle
of its image buffer, depending

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:30.076 A:middle
on the actions you perform in

00:29:30.076 --> 00:29:30.976 A:middle
the actions block.

00:29:33.656 --> 00:29:35.876 A:middle
If you are running your code on

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:37.436 A:middle
a operating system prior to iOS

00:29:37.436 --> 00:29:38.846 A:middle
12, you can use the

00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:41.166 A:middle
prefersExtendedRange property on

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:43.666 A:middle
UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat to

00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:45.256 A:middle
tell UIKit whether you plan on

00:29:45.256 --> 00:29:46.906 A:middle
drawing wide color content or

00:29:47.386 --> 00:29:47.486 A:middle
not.

00:29:50.196 --> 00:29:52.036 A:middle
But there's a medium middle

00:29:52.036 --> 00:29:52.646 A:middle
ground here.

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:55.256 A:middle
If you're primarily rendering an

00:29:55.256 --> 00:29:56.956 A:middle
image in to a graphic image

00:29:56.956 --> 00:29:59.456 A:middle
renderer, that image may use a

00:29:59.456 --> 00:30:02.456 A:middle
color space that required values
