00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:01.666 A:middle
UIImageView, UIImageView will

00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:04.006 A:middle
take care to execute that recipe

00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:05.256 A:middle
on the GPU.

00:31:05.726 --> 00:31:08.286 A:middle
This is efficient and it keeps

00:31:08.286 --> 00:31:09.606 A:middle
the CPU free for doing other

00:31:09.606 --> 00:31:10.646 A:middle
work in your application.

00:31:11.176 --> 00:31:13.686 A:middle
In order to use it create your

00:31:13.686 --> 00:31:15.736 A:middle
CIImage as normal, and then use

00:31:15.736 --> 00:31:17.606 A:middle
the UIImage ciImage initializer.

00:31:19.296 --> 00:31:20.816 A:middle
There are other advanced

00:31:20.816 --> 00:31:23.066 A:middle
frameworks for processing and

00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:25.426 A:middle
rendering graphical content that

00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:27.276 A:middle
are available on iOS, including

00:31:27.606 --> 00:31:29.796 A:middle
Metal, Vison, and Accelerate.

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:32.406 A:middle
And one of the data types that

00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:33.756 A:middle
is common among these frameworks

00:31:33.966 --> 00:31:35.186 A:middle
is CVPixelBuffer.

00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:37.526 A:middle
And this is a data type that

00:31:37.526 --> 00:31:39.986 A:middle
represents a buffer that can be

00:31:39.986 --> 00:31:42.436 A:middle
in use or not in use on the CPU

00:31:42.676 --> 00:31:43.476 A:middle
or on the GPU.

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:45.566 A:middle
When constructing one of these

00:31:45.566 --> 00:31:47.416 A:middle
pixel buffers make sure to use

00:31:47.416 --> 00:31:48.546 A:middle
the best initializer.

00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:49.816 A:middle
The one that's closest to the

00:31:49.816 --> 00:31:51.566 A:middle
representation you have at hand.

00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:54.696 A:middle
Don't unwind any of the decoding

00:31:54.696 --> 00:31:54.926 A:middle
work.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:57.006 A:middle
It's already been done by the

00:31:57.006 --> 00:31:58.836 A:middle
existing UIImage or CGImage

00:31:59.116 --> 00:32:00.146 A:middle
representations.
