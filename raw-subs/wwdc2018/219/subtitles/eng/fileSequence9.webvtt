00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.676 A:middle
And, eventually, if your

00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:02.776 A:middle
application consumes enough

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.736 A:middle
memory, your application itself

00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:05.556 A:middle
could get terminated.

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:07.306 A:middle
And some of those background

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:08.536 A:middle
processes are doing important

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:09.586 A:middle
work on behalf of the user.

00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:10.986 A:middle
So, they might get started up

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:11.906 A:middle
again as soon as they get

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:12.456 A:middle
terminated.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.086 A:middle
So, even though your application

00:09:15.396 --> 00:09:16.666 A:middle
might only be consuming memory

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:18.546 A:middle
for a short period of time, it

00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:20.456 A:middle
can have this really long-tail

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:22.996 A:middle
effect on CPU utilization.

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:25.626 A:middle
So, we want to reduce the amount

00:09:25.626 --> 00:09:26.876 A:middle
of memory that our application

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:27.436 A:middle
uses.

00:09:27.556 --> 00:09:28.596 A:middle
And we can get ahead of the

00:09:28.596 --> 00:09:30.406 A:middle
curve with a technique called

00:09:30.406 --> 00:09:31.146 A:middle
downsampling.

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:34.236 A:middle
Now, here we see a little bit

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:35.726 A:middle
more detail about our image

00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:36.606 A:middle
rendering pipeline.

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:38.346 A:middle
Including the fact that the

00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:39.236 A:middle
image view we're going to

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.206 A:middle
display our image in is actually

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.906 A:middle
smaller than the image we're

00:09:42.906 --> 00:09:44.366 A:middle
going to display inside of it.

00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:47.096 A:middle
Normally, the core animation

00:09:47.376 --> 00:09:48.656 A:middle
framework would be responsible

00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:50.346 A:middle
for shrinking that image down

00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:52.326 A:middle
during the rendering phase, but

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:54.226 A:middle
we can save some memory by using

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:55.526 A:middle
this downsampling technique.

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:56.906 A:middle
And what we're going to do,

00:09:56.906 --> 00:09:58.596 A:middle
essentially, is capture that

00:09:58.596 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
shrinking operation into an
