00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.266 A:middle
important kind of buffer is an

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:01.946 A:middle
image buffer.

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:03.896 A:middle
This is a term we use for buffer

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:05.486 A:middle
that holds the in-memory

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:07.796 A:middle
representation of some image.

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.136 A:middle
Each element of this buffer

00:04:10.596 --> 00:04:12.226 A:middle
describes the color and

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
transparency of a single pixel

00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:15.886 A:middle
in our image.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:19.476 A:middle
And consequently, the size of

00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:20.766 A:middle
this buffer in memory is

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:22.706 A:middle
proportional to the size of the

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:23.856 A:middle
image that it contains.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.856 A:middle
One particularly important

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:29.636 A:middle
example of a buffer is called

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.256 A:middle
the frame buffer.

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:32.566 A:middle
And the frame buffer is what

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:34.616 A:middle
holds the actual rendered output

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:35.646 A:middle
of your application.

00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:38.516 A:middle
So, as your application updates

00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:41.186 A:middle
its view hierarchy UIKit will

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:43.446 A:middle
render the application's window

00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:45.516 A:middle
and all of its subviews into the

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:46.116 A:middle
frame buffer.

00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:48.556 A:middle
And that frame buffer provides

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:50.806 A:middle
per pixel color information that

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.786 A:middle
the display hardware will read

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:53.856 A:middle
in order to illuminate the

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.106 A:middle
pixels on the display.

00:04:58.246 --> 00:04:59.936 A:middle
Now, that last part happens at a

00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:00.616 A:middle
fixed interval.
