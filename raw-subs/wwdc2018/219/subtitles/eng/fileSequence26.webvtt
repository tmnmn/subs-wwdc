00:25:58.286 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
UIView can still work, even if

00:26:00.236 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
you don't override draw.

00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:03.026 A:middle
For example, setting the

00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:04.546 A:middle
background color of a UIView

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.196 A:middle
doesn't require creating a

00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:08.036 A:middle
backing store, unless you're

00:26:08.036 --> 00:26:09.026 A:middle
using a pattern color.

00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:10.716 A:middle
So, I recommend not using

00:26:10.716 --> 00:26:11.536 A:middle
patterned colors with a

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:12.736 A:middle
background color property on

00:26:12.736 --> 00:26:13.296 A:middle
UIView.

00:26:14.836 --> 00:26:17.176 A:middle
Instead, create a UIImageView.

00:26:17.746 --> 00:26:19.316 A:middle
Assign your image to that image

00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:19.536 A:middle
view.

00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:21.256 A:middle
And use the functions on

00:26:21.256 --> 00:26:23.466 A:middle
UIImageView to set your tiling

00:26:23.466 --> 00:26:24.576 A:middle
parameters appropriately.

00:26:25.086 --> 00:26:29.466 A:middle
When we want to clip the corners

00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:32.466 A:middle
of that rounded rectangle, we

00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:33.836 A:middle
want to use the CALayer

00:26:33.836 --> 00:26:34.986 A:middle
cornerRadius property.

00:26:35.776 --> 00:26:37.536 A:middle
Because Core Animation is able

00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:39.886 A:middle
to render clipped corners

00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:41.626 A:middle
without taking any extra memory

00:26:41.626 --> 00:26:42.426 A:middle
allocations.

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:44.556 A:middle
If we, instead, use the more

00:26:44.556 --> 00:26:46.966 A:middle
powerful maskView or maskLayer

00:26:46.966 --> 00:26:49.176 A:middle
properties we'd wind up taking

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:50.666 A:middle
in extra allocation to store

00:26:50.666 --> 00:26:51.986 A:middle
that mask.

00:26:53.216 --> 00:26:55.006 A:middle
If you have a more complicated

00:26:55.006 --> 00:26:56.996 A:middle
background that has transparent

00:26:56.996 --> 00:26:59.246 A:middle
areas that can't be expressed by

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.346 A:middle
the cornerRadius property,
