00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:02.596 A:middle
calls to functions that took in

00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:05.126 A:middle
or returned structures that had

00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:06.676 A:middle
ARC object pointer fields in

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:07.916 A:middle
Objective-C++.

00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:10.756 A:middle
And this was done through an ABI

00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:14.046 A:middle
change in Xcode 10 and ABI

00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:16.016 A:middle
change affects functions in

00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:19.166 A:middle
Objective C++ which return or

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:21.206 A:middle
take in a structure by value

00:09:21.606 --> 00:09:23.516 A:middle
that has ARC object pointer

00:09:23.516 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
fields and no special member

00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:27.726 A:middle
functions like constructors or

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:28.626 A:middle
destructors.

00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:31.776 A:middle
Now if you are not sure what

00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:33.656 A:middle
this means for you or whether

00:09:33.946 --> 00:09:35.676 A:middle
your code is affected by this

00:09:35.716 --> 00:09:38.146 A:middle
ABI change please take a look at

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:40.286 A:middle
Xcode's release notes where we

00:09:40.286 --> 00:09:42.526 A:middle
describe in more details the

00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:44.296 A:middle
effects and the impact of this

00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:44.886 A:middle
ABI change.

00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:50.676 A:middle
Now there is one caveat when it

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:53.176 A:middle
comes to the ARC object pointer

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.866 A:middle
fields and C structures, they're

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:56.976 A:middle
not supported in Swift.

00:09:57.766 --> 00:09:59.546 A:middle
So if you try to use a structure
