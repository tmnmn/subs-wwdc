00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.416 A:middle
provides the performOperation

00:12:00.416 --> 00:12:02.146 A:middle
method which takes in the

00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:03.616 A:middle
handler block parameter that

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.726 A:middle
corresponds to Swift's handler

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:06.766 A:middle
closure parameter.

00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:08.736 A:middle
But just by looking at the

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:11.406 A:middle
Objective-C code we have no way

00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:12.786 A:middle
of knowing whether the handler

00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:14.486 A:middle
parameter can escape or not.

00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:19.046 A:middle
Xcode 10 now provides a warning

00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:21.976 A:middle
that helps us to remember that

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:23.656 A:middle
this parameter is actually

00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:24.866 A:middle
non-escaping.

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:29.346 A:middle
To fix this this warning you can

00:12:29.486 --> 00:12:31.196 A:middle
annotate your block parameter

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:33.596 A:middle
with the NS NOESCAPE annotation.

00:12:34.676 --> 00:12:36.056 A:middle
You should also annotate the

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:38.416 A:middle
implementation of the method or

00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:39.456 A:middle
the parameter in the

00:12:39.456 --> 00:12:40.716 A:middle
implementation of the method

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:42.816 A:middle
with NS NOESCAPE annotation.

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:46.466 A:middle
Now the NS NOESCAPE annotation

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.976 A:middle
is simply a reminder for you the

00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:51.656 A:middle
programmer to ensure that you

00:12:51.656 --> 00:12:54.516 A:middle
don't store or call the handler

00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:55.756 A:middle
block after they perform

00:12:55.756 --> 00:12:57.466 A:middle
operation method returns.

00:12:58.756 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
So it's there for you to help
