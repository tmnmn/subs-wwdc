00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:00.836 A:middle
could restructure your

00:19:00.836 --> 00:19:02.586 A:middle
application to use continuations

00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:04.176 A:middle
in stat and just calls the

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:05.586 A:middle
required function inside the

00:19:05.586 --> 00:19:06.176 A:middle
callback.

00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:10.706 A:middle
So this check is not enabled by

00:19:10.706 --> 00:19:12.516 A:middle
default but we encourage you to

00:19:12.516 --> 00:19:14.576 A:middle
enable it in build settings in

00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:16.276 A:middle
order to make sure no such

00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:17.256 A:middle
problem securing your

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.956 A:middle
application and it runs as fast

00:19:18.956 --> 00:19:19.526 A:middle
as possible.

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:23.076 A:middle
Now let's talk about the second

00:19:23.076 --> 00:19:24.746 A:middle
check for detecting the

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:25.976 A:middle
autoreleasing variables

00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:27.646 A:middle
outliving the lifetime of the

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:28.566 A:middle
autorelease pool.

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:32.336 A:middle
So the autoreleasing qualifier

00:19:32.626 --> 00:19:34.526 A:middle
specifies that the value has to

00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:36.356 A:middle
be released once the control

00:19:36.356 --> 00:19:37.886 A:middle
exits the autorelease pool.

00:19:38.606 --> 00:19:41.156 A:middle
So here we have an example where

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:42.786 A:middle
we create an error variable

00:19:43.076 --> 00:19:44.956 A:middle
inside the autorelease pool and

00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:46.326 A:middle
once the control is outside of

00:19:46.326 --> 00:19:47.596 A:middle
the autorelease pool the

00:19:47.596 --> 00:19:49.336 A:middle
variable is released and

00:19:49.336 --> 00:19:50.456 A:middle
subsequently destroyed.

00:19:51.176 --> 00:19:53.516 A:middle
And autoreleasing pools are a

00:19:53.516 --> 00:19:55.556 A:middle
useful feature of Objective-C to

00:19:55.556 --> 00:19:56.976 A:middle
help contain the big memory

00:19:56.976 --> 00:19:58.586 A:middle
footprint of your applications

00:19:58.586 --> 00:19:59.986 A:middle
and to ensure that thumbprints

00:19:59.986 --> 00:20:00.946 A:middle
are destroyed where necessary.
