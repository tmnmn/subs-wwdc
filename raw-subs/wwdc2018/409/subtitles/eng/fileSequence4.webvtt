[ Applause ]

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.166 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.506 A:middle
let's say we'd like to write a

00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:05.846 A:middle
food ordering app and we'd like

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:07.676 A:middle
to create a data structure which

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.176 A:middle
represents a menu item.

00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:13.226 A:middle
In Xcode 9 and earlier it would

00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:14.716 A:middle
have been impossible for us to

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:17.055 A:middle
actually use a C structure with

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:19.505 A:middle
ARC object pointer fields, so we

00:04:19.536 --> 00:04:21.546 A:middle
would have had to use a C, an

00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:24.506 A:middle
Objective-C class here.

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:26.516 A:middle
Xcode 10 now allows us to

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.926 A:middle
actually create a C structure

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.616 A:middle
that has ARC object pointer

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:29.976 A:middle
fields.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:35.906 A:middle
Let's keep going and keep

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:38.176 A:middle
writing our food ordering app.

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.546 A:middle
Let's create a function that

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.236 A:middle
orders free food for us.

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:43.246 A:middle
In the function let's create a

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:45.736 A:middle
variable item of type menu item

00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:46.996 A:middle
with a price of zero.

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:50.436 A:middle
Then let's pass this item into

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:52.096 A:middle
another function that actually

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:53.416 A:middle
orders the food for us.

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:57.276 A:middle
When the item is created the

00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.716 A:middle
compiler has to synthesize code
