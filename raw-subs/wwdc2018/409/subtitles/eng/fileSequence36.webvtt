00:35:58.516 --> 00:36:00.286 A:middle
So you can only pass large

00:36:00.286 --> 00:36:03.666 A:middle
vectors, so 256 bits and up from

00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:05.296 A:middle
and to AVX-512 functions.

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:07.766 A:middle
So the ABI is different from the

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:09.016 A:middle
generic and a specialized

00:36:09.016 --> 00:36:10.516 A:middle
variance, so you cannot pass

00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:13.966 A:middle
them between those.

00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:16.376 A:middle
Additionally, these vectors are

00:36:16.376 --> 00:36:18.236 A:middle
large and they're large enough

00:36:18.236 --> 00:36:19.856 A:middle
that their natural alignment is

00:36:20.106 --> 00:36:21.966 A:middle
too big for what's guaranteed by

00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:22.746 A:middle
things like malloc.

00:36:22.746 --> 00:36:24.216 A:middle
So you have to take that into

00:36:24.216 --> 00:36:25.596 A:middle
account when allocating these

00:36:26.526 --> 00:36:30.316 A:middle
anywhere other than the stack.

00:36:30.316 --> 00:36:31.876 A:middle
And so in general all of these

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:33.406 A:middle
things are things that we are

00:36:33.406 --> 00:36:34.396 A:middle
already go through lots of

00:36:34.536 --> 00:36:36.056 A:middle
things in the opening system.

00:36:36.536 --> 00:36:37.936 A:middle
So for instance, if you can at

00:36:37.936 --> 00:36:40.056 A:middle
all use accelerate.framework and

00:36:40.056 --> 00:36:41.326 A:middle
it's much easier to do so

00:36:41.656 --> 00:36:42.976 A:middle
because we already specialized

00:36:42.976 --> 00:36:44.506 A:middle
all the functions for every

00:36:44.506 --> 00:36:45.696 A:middle
single microarchitecture.

00:36:46.346 --> 00:36:49.806 A:middle
So this is AVX-512.

00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:53.576 A:middle
Now we also have new features on

00:36:53.576 --> 00:36:56.936 A:middle
the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X.

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:01.716 A:middle
So one of the first feature is
