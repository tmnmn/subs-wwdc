00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:01.646 A:middle
greatest tools that we possibly

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.806 A:middle
can to move technology forward.

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:07.686 A:middle
And if you ever have a compiler

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:08.895 A:middle
itch that you would like to

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.735 A:middle
scratch we would like to invite

00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:13.396 A:middle
you to participate with us and

00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:15.146 A:middle
go to the LLVM website here at

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:17.986 A:middle
llvm.org or you can come talk to

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:19.716 A:middle
us later today later today in

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:21.906 A:middle
the LLVM labs and many of our

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:23.446 A:middle
compiler engineers from Apple

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:25.066 A:middle
will be there and I'm sure will

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.506 A:middle
be more than happy to talk your

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:28.786 A:middle
ear off about anything and

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:30.136 A:middle
everything compiler related

00:02:30.476 --> 00:02:31.646 A:middle
you've ever wanted to know.

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:36.096 A:middle
So for today we have a great set

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:37.306 A:middle
of things that we want to share

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:37.656 A:middle
with you.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.476 A:middle
We have updates on automated

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:40.766 A:middle
reference counting that makes it

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.826 A:middle
even easier for the compiler to

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:43.876 A:middle
help you with your memory

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:44.466 A:middle
management.

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:47.146 A:middle
We have new diagnostics in Xcode

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:49.266 A:middle
10 and new checks in the Static

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.536 A:middle
Analyzer to help catch bugs in

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:53.536 A:middle
your project sooner at build

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.646 A:middle
time to improve the quality of

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:56.376 A:middle
your code.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:58.116 A:middle
We have compiler features that

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.526 A:middle
improve security, both of

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:01.446 A:middle
Apple's platforms and of your
