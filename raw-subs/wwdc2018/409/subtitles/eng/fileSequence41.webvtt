00:41:00.586 --> 00:41:01.716 A:middle
is that they're not available

00:41:01.716 --> 00:41:02.106 A:middle
everywhere.

00:41:03.516 --> 00:41:05.166 A:middle
So when you want to use them you

00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:06.666 A:middle
have to always make sure that

00:41:06.666 --> 00:41:08.246 A:middle
they're actually dynamically

00:41:08.246 --> 00:41:09.246 A:middle
available on the device you're

00:41:09.246 --> 00:41:11.096 A:middle
running and you can do that

00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:12.236 A:middle
using sysctlbyname.

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:15.326 A:middle
And so in general we already do

00:41:15.326 --> 00:41:16.736 A:middle
all this in system framework, so

00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:18.546 A:middle
it's much easier to just rely on

00:41:18.546 --> 00:41:18.966 A:middle
those.

00:41:19.546 --> 00:41:22.776 A:middle
So these are three new

00:41:22.776 --> 00:41:24.666 A:middle
instruction set extensions, we

00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:26.786 A:middle
have on the iMac Pro AVX-512 and

00:41:26.856 --> 00:41:28.606 A:middle
on iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus we

00:41:28.606 --> 00:41:30.526 A:middle
have Atomics and 16-bit floating

00:41:30.526 --> 00:41:30.836 A:middle
points.

00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:35.306 A:middle
So that's just part of all the

00:41:35.306 --> 00:41:36.556 A:middle
new features in Xcode.

00:41:37.306 --> 00:41:39.356 A:middle
So from ARC object pointers in C

00:41:39.356 --> 00:41:41.026 A:middle
Structs to the improved static

00:41:41.026 --> 00:41:42.756 A:middle
analyzer there are lots of great

00:41:42.796 --> 00:41:43.696 A:middle
things in Xcode 10.

00:41:44.286 --> 00:41:45.986 A:middle
And there are also some things

00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:47.176 A:middle
that we didn't even talk about

00:41:47.516 --> 00:41:48.616 A:middle
like for instance, over a

00:41:48.616 --> 00:41:50.446 A:middle
hundred new warnings and support

00:41:50.446 --> 00:41:53.186 A:middle
for C++ 17 standard library

00:41:53.186 --> 00:41:53.586 A:middle
function.

00:41:55.496 --> 00:41:57.636 A:middle
So if you want to learn more we

00:41:57.636 --> 00:41:59.226 A:middle
have the video and the slides

00:41:59.226 --> 00:42:00.466 A:middle
available on the website soon.
