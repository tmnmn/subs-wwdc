00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:00.336 A:middle
Static Analyzer, it's a great

00:24:00.336 --> 00:24:01.726 A:middle
tool to find your bugs before

00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:02.366 A:middle
users do.

00:24:02.706 --> 00:24:04.996 A:middle
And now my colleague Ahmed will

00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.376 A:middle
talk about low-level

00:24:06.376 --> 00:24:07.026 A:middle
improvements.

00:24:07.936 --> 00:24:10.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you George.

[ Applause ]

00:24:15.046 --> 00:24:16.176 A:middle
So as Alex and George told you,

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:18.486 A:middle
we have lots of warnings and

00:24:18.776 --> 00:24:20.326 A:middle
Static Analyzer checks in the

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:22.496 A:middle
compiler, but you also have the

00:24:22.496 --> 00:24:24.186 A:middle
sanitizer and all of these tools

00:24:24.186 --> 00:24:25.476 A:middle
help you find lots of bugs,

00:24:25.576 --> 00:24:26.586 A:middle
including security bugs.

00:24:27.146 --> 00:24:29.606 A:middle
So I'm sure you all have lots of

00:24:29.606 --> 00:24:30.866 A:middle
tests and use all these great

00:24:30.866 --> 00:24:33.766 A:middle
tools to find all the bugs in

00:24:33.766 --> 00:24:34.366 A:middle
these tests.

00:24:35.066 --> 00:24:36.126 A:middle
But for some of the most

00:24:36.126 --> 00:24:38.496 A:middle
egregious security bugs we want

00:24:38.496 --> 00:24:39.546 A:middle
to make sure that they don't

00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:41.566 A:middle
happen in release builds if

00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:43.126 A:middle
somehow they snuck past all the

00:24:43.126 --> 00:24:43.516 A:middle
testing.

00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:48.246 A:middle
So for those we have mitigations

00:24:48.246 --> 00:24:49.516 A:middle
in the code generator that are

00:24:49.516 --> 00:24:50.856 A:middle
always emitted even in release

00:24:50.886 --> 00:24:51.216 A:middle
builds.

00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:54.326 A:middle
So I'm Ahmed, I work on the code

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:55.616 A:middle
generator and today I'm going to

00:24:55.616 --> 00:24:57.486 A:middle
tell you about a new mitigation

00:24:57.486 --> 00:24:58.316 A:middle
in Xcode 10.

00:24:58.906 --> 00:25:01.226 A:middle
So to see how that works we need
