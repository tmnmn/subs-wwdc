00:38:58.906 --> 00:39:02.536 A:middle
the same cache line.

00:39:02.776 --> 00:39:04.366 A:middle
So both are going to try to have

00:39:04.366 --> 00:39:05.876 A:middle
exclusive access over this

00:39:06.126 --> 00:39:08.616 A:middle
variable and that is not

00:39:08.616 --> 00:39:09.846 A:middle
possible, that's what it means

00:39:09.886 --> 00:39:12.196 A:middle
to be exclusive.

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:14.346 A:middle
So both of them are going to

00:39:14.346 --> 00:39:16.636 A:middle
fail their exclusive access and

00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:17.726 A:middle
they're going to have to try

00:39:17.726 --> 00:39:18.656 A:middle
again until one of them

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:19.146 A:middle
succeeds.

00:39:19.796 --> 00:39:23.086 A:middle
And this is not ideal for

00:39:23.086 --> 00:39:23.706 A:middle
performance.

00:39:24.286 --> 00:39:27.896 A:middle
So in ARM v8.1 which is the

00:39:28.536 --> 00:39:31.546 A:middle
architecture in the A10 CPU we

00:39:31.546 --> 00:39:32.636 A:middle
have new instructions that do

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:34.626 A:middle
this all in a single step and in

00:39:34.626 --> 00:39:35.756 A:middle
some cases, that can greatly

00:39:35.756 --> 00:39:36.566 A:middle
improve performance.

00:39:37.126 --> 00:39:39.676 A:middle
So again, this is something that

00:39:39.676 --> 00:39:41.216 A:middle
you can specialize code for

00:39:41.526 --> 00:39:43.796 A:middle
using the per function

00:39:43.796 --> 00:39:45.426 A:middle
specialization or for entire

00:39:45.426 --> 00:39:45.996 A:middle
targets.

00:39:46.246 --> 00:39:48.086 A:middle
And this is something that's

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:49.606 A:middle
only really useful when you have

00:39:49.606 --> 00:39:52.106 A:middle
your own C11 or C++ 11 atomics.

00:39:53.086 --> 00:39:54.486 A:middle
So in general, it's much easier

00:39:54.486 --> 00:39:55.736 A:middle
to use the higher-level

00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:58.376 A:middle
libraries like GCD or PThread or

00:39:58.376 --> 00:39:58.976 A:middle
os unfair lock, etcetera.

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:02.096 A:middle
So these are already tweaked for
