00:14:57.186 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
Once we do that the new layout

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:02.546 A:middle
rules will apply only to the

00:15:02.546 --> 00:15:05.006 A:middle
packed structure so they won't

00:15:05.296 --> 00:15:06.676 A:middle
affect any other structures in

00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:06.976 A:middle
our program.

00:15:12.046 --> 00:15:13.596 A:middle
These two new warnings that I

00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:16.026 A:middle
mentioned are enabled by default

00:15:16.026 --> 00:15:18.936 A:middle
in Xcode 10 and they are there

00:15:18.936 --> 00:15:21.186 A:middle
to help you write more correct

00:15:21.346 --> 00:15:22.606 A:middle
and more robust code.

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:24.766 A:middle
And to talk more about more

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:27.066 A:middle
correct and more robust code I'd

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:28.646 A:middle
like to invite George up on

00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:30.126 A:middle
stage who will talk about the

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:31.556 A:middle
new static analyzing

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.126 A:middle
improvements in Xcode 10.

00:15:33.376 --> 00:15:33.536 A:middle
George.

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:39.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:42.056 --> 00:15:43.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Alex, so I would like

00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:44.836 A:middle
to tell you about some of the

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:46.706 A:middle
improvements we have done for

00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:48.896 A:middle
Xcode 10 for the Clang Static

00:15:48.896 --> 00:15:49.456 A:middle
Analyzer.

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:52.086 A:middle
So the Clang Static Analyzer is

00:15:52.086 --> 00:15:53.566 A:middle
a great tool for finding HK

00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:55.936 A:middle
hard-to-reproduce bugs in your

00:15:55.936 --> 00:15:56.486 A:middle
program.

00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:58.656 A:middle
And not only the Static Analyzer

00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
finds the bug for you it also
