00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.386 A:middle
that has ARC object pointer

00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:03.766 A:middle
fields from Swift you will just

00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:05.346 A:middle
get a compilation error because

00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:06.976 A:middle
the structure will not be found.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:16.286 A:middle
In addition to new features like

00:10:16.696 --> 00:10:18.356 A:middle
support for ARC object pointer

00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:22.306 A:middle
fields Xcode 10 comes with a lot

00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:24.356 A:middle
of new compiler diagnostics.

00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:26.426 A:middle
We actually have over a hundred

00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:28.986 A:middle
new warnings in Xcode 10 and

00:10:28.986 --> 00:10:30.566 A:middle
today I'd like to talk about two

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:30.846 A:middle
of them.

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:33.326 A:middle
The first warning might be of

00:10:33.556 --> 00:10:36.036 A:middle
interest to those of you who

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:38.676 A:middle
have mixed Swift and Objective-C

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:39.036 A:middle
code.

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:42.466 A:middle
So as you know Swift code can be

00:10:42.466 --> 00:10:45.786 A:middle
imported into Objective-C and

00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:48.586 A:middle
Xcode allows you to do that by

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:50.356 A:middle
generating a header file that

00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:52.826 A:middle
describes the Swift interface

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.836 A:middle
using Objective-C declarations.

00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:57.856 A:middle
And you can import this header

00:10:57.856 --> 00:10:59.476 A:middle
file into your own Objective-C

00:10:59.476 --> 00:11:01.736 A:middle
code to get access to the
