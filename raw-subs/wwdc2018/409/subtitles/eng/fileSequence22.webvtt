00:21:59.476 --> 00:22:00.636 A:middle
parameters explicitly

00:22:00.636 --> 00:22:01.346 A:middle
autoreleasing.

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:03.486 A:middle
But we have noticed that such

00:22:03.486 --> 00:22:06.486 A:middle
issue kept occurring, so in

00:22:06.486 --> 00:22:08.026 A:middle
Xcode 10 we introduced a more

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:10.356 A:middle
powerful Clang Static Analyzer

00:22:10.356 --> 00:22:13.906 A:middle
warning which knows which APIs

00:22:14.956 --> 00:22:16.866 A:middle
call the provided block inside

00:22:16.866 --> 00:22:18.846 A:middle
the autorelease pool and warns

00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:19.966 A:middle
about such cases.

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:24.956 A:middle
So now let's see how this issue

00:22:24.956 --> 00:22:25.676 A:middle
can be fixed.

00:22:26.286 --> 00:22:28.316 A:middle
And the simplest fix here is

00:22:28.316 --> 00:22:29.796 A:middle
just to introduce a strong local

00:22:29.796 --> 00:22:32.376 A:middle
variable and then when you're

00:22:32.376 --> 00:22:34.836 A:middle
inside the block write a value

00:22:34.836 --> 00:22:36.296 A:middle
into the strong variable in

00:22:36.296 --> 00:22:36.806 A:middle
stat.

00:22:37.646 --> 00:22:39.456 A:middle
And then only copy to the out

00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:41.646 A:middle
parameter once the control is

00:22:41.646 --> 00:22:43.286 A:middle
outside of the block and you

00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:44.666 A:middle
know it's not inside the

00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:46.216 A:middle
autorelease pool and it's safe

00:22:46.276 --> 00:22:47.696 A:middle
to write into the autoreleasing

00:22:47.696 --> 00:22:47.976 A:middle
variable.

00:22:53.236 --> 00:22:55.206 A:middle
And finally, we also have

00:22:55.206 --> 00:22:56.306 A:middle
improved performance and

00:22:56.306 --> 00:22:57.706 A:middle
visualizations of the Clang

00:22:57.706 --> 00:22:58.566 A:middle
Static Analyzer.

00:22:59.676 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
So in Xcode 10 we have improved
