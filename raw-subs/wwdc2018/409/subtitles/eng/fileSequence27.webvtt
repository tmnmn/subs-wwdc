00:26:59.276 --> 00:27:01.536 A:middle
address and this is a big

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:02.386 A:middle
security problem.

00:27:02.956 --> 00:27:04.826 A:middle
So if an attacker controls the

00:27:04.826 --> 00:27:06.446 A:middle
string that I'm copying which is

00:27:06.716 --> 00:27:08.496 A:middle
not that hard, then it can

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:09.776 A:middle
control the return address.

00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:11.496 A:middle
If it can control the return

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:12.626 A:middle
address then they control

00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:13.806 A:middle
basically what the program does

00:27:13.806 --> 00:27:14.706 A:middle
next, so it's a big security

00:27:14.706 --> 00:27:14.976 A:middle
problem.

00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:21.446 A:middle
So if you had a test that caught

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:23.586 A:middle
this and you ran the address

00:27:23.586 --> 00:27:26.376 A:middle
sanitizer, then you will have

00:27:26.446 --> 00:27:27.886 A:middle
had an easy way to fix this.

00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:29.266 A:middle
And really what I should have

00:27:29.266 --> 00:27:32.686 A:middle
done here is strncpy that knows

00:27:32.686 --> 00:27:34.546 A:middle
about the size or even better

00:27:34.546 --> 00:27:35.876 A:middle
use a higher-level API like

00:27:35.876 --> 00:27:36.886 A:middle
NSString or [inaudible] string.

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.736 A:middle
But still sometimes these bugs

00:27:40.736 --> 00:27:42.236 A:middle
can survive into release builds

00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:46.566 A:middle
and we avoid these by using

00:27:46.566 --> 00:27:48.366 A:middle
what's called the Stack

00:27:49.496 --> 00:27:49.766 A:middle
Protector.

00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.086 A:middle
So the Stack Protector changes

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:52.176 A:middle
the layout of the stack frame to

00:27:52.176 --> 00:27:54.716 A:middle
add a new field the canary so

00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:58.616 A:middle
that when we do our write we

00:27:58.616 --> 00:28:00.136 A:middle
have a little bit of code right
