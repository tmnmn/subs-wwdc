00:22:59.676 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
So in Xcode 10 we have improved

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:03.966 A:middle
the analyzer to explore your

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.536 A:middle
program in a more efficient way

00:23:05.766 --> 00:23:08.386 A:middle
so now it finds up to 15% more

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:10.666 A:middle
bugs during the same analysis

00:23:10.666 --> 00:23:11.006 A:middle
time.

00:23:11.896 --> 00:23:14.226 A:middle
And not only it finds more bugs

00:23:14.786 --> 00:23:16.556 A:middle
the bug report it now generates

00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:19.116 A:middle
tend to be smaller and more

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:19.906 A:middle
understandable.

00:23:20.116 --> 00:23:22.006 A:middle
And what I mean by that is

00:23:22.006 --> 00:23:25.026 A:middle
sometimes in Xcode 10 you would

00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:26.646 A:middle
get examples which have a lot of

00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:28.866 A:middle
steps and a lot of arrows and

00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:30.016 A:middle
which would be somewhat hard to

00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:30.686 A:middle
comprehend.

00:23:31.246 --> 00:23:33.976 A:middle
And in many of those examples in

00:23:33.976 --> 00:23:36.256 A:middle
your version of Xcode we give

00:23:36.256 --> 00:23:38.196 A:middle
you a much smaller error path

00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:40.116 A:middle
which is much easier to see and

00:23:40.116 --> 00:23:41.146 A:middle
you can see the issue much

00:23:41.146 --> 00:23:41.656 A:middle
faster.

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:45.346 A:middle
So in order to use Static

00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:47.566 A:middle
Analyzer on your projects you

00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:51.256 A:middle
can use Product, Analyze or you

00:23:51.256 --> 00:23:53.396 A:middle
can even enable Analyze During

00:23:53.396 --> 00:23:55.456 A:middle
Build to make sure no analyzer

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:56.626 A:middle
issue gets unnoticed.

00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:58.676 A:middle
So I encourage you to use the

00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:00.336 A:middle
Static Analyzer, it's a great
