00:37:58.386 --> 00:38:02.536 A:middle
So the way atomics work is

00:38:03.546 --> 00:38:04.746 A:middle
through a small sequence of

00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:05.096 A:middle
codes.

00:38:05.776 --> 00:38:08.116 A:middle
So suppose I have a thread and

00:38:08.116 --> 00:38:09.156 A:middle
it's trying to access main

00:38:09.156 --> 00:38:11.856 A:middle
memory, so it has an atomic

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.826 A:middle
shared variable in there and

00:38:13.826 --> 00:38:14.996 A:middle
it's just trying to increment

00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:15.726 A:middle
it.

00:38:17.216 --> 00:38:18.716 A:middle
So under the hood the code

00:38:18.716 --> 00:38:20.176 A:middle
generator will emit a small

00:38:20.176 --> 00:38:23.026 A:middle
sequence of codes that first

00:38:23.276 --> 00:38:24.946 A:middle
takes exclusive excess of a

00:38:24.946 --> 00:38:26.816 A:middle
cache line and that's a small

00:38:26.816 --> 00:38:28.766 A:middle
region of memory that contains

00:38:28.766 --> 00:38:30.836 A:middle
completely this atomic variable.

00:38:31.426 --> 00:38:34.816 A:middle
Now that we have exclusive

00:38:34.816 --> 00:38:36.186 A:middle
access we can load from the

00:38:36.186 --> 00:38:38.046 A:middle
variable, then we can do our

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.326 A:middle
increment on the temporary

00:38:39.436 --> 00:38:41.756 A:middle
loaded value and store the

00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:43.026 A:middle
result back.

00:38:44.636 --> 00:38:46.186 A:middle
And we know that this is safe

00:38:46.186 --> 00:38:47.066 A:middle
because we have exclusive

00:38:47.066 --> 00:38:48.766 A:middle
access, so no other thread could

00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.376 A:middle
have changed the value while

00:38:50.376 --> 00:38:51.936 A:middle
we're computing our temporary

00:38:51.936 --> 00:38:52.346 A:middle
results.

00:38:53.696 --> 00:38:55.496 A:middle
But now suppose another thread

00:38:55.496 --> 00:38:57.446 A:middle
does access either the same

00:38:57.446 --> 00:38:58.906 A:middle
variable or another variable in

00:38:58.906 --> 00:39:02.536 A:middle
the same cache line.
