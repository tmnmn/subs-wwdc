00:12:58.756 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
So it's there for you to help

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.196 A:middle
you remember that there is this

00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:05.686 A:middle
contract that exists between

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:09.926 A:middle
your Swift and Objective-C code.

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:11.616 A:middle
Now the second warning might be

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:14.326 A:middle
of interest to those of you who

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.056 A:middle
work with more low-level code

00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:18.296 A:middle
and who care about the way that

00:13:18.296 --> 00:13:20.156 A:middle
structures are laid out in

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:20.566 A:middle
memory.

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:22.886 A:middle
Let's take a look at one

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:23.406 A:middle
structure.

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:25.776 A:middle
So in C structures have to

00:13:25.776 --> 00:13:27.766 A:middle
follow strict layout and

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:28.816 A:middle
alignment rules.

00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:31.126 A:middle
In this particular structure

00:13:31.126 --> 00:13:32.096 A:middle
that you see right now on the

00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:34.606 A:middle
slide the compiler has to insert

00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:36.706 A:middle
a 2-byte pattern between the

00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:38.666 A:middle
second and the third field of

00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:39.246 A:middle
the structure.

00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:42.066 A:middle
Sometimes you might want to

00:13:42.066 --> 00:13:44.386 A:middle
relax these rules and the

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:46.956 A:middle
compiler provides a pragma pack

00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:48.906 A:middle
directive that you can use to

00:13:48.906 --> 00:13:50.446 A:middle
control the layout and the

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:51.846 A:middle
alignment of your structures.

00:13:54.196 --> 00:13:56.956 A:middle
Now in this example we use the

00:13:56.956 --> 00:13:59.906 A:middle
pragma pack push, 1 directive to

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:03.556 A:middle
remove this fixated layout and
