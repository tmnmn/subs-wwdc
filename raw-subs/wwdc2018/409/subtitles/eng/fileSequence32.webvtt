00:31:58.906 --> 00:32:00.796 A:middle
new extension, sect extensions.

00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:04.386 A:middle
So as you all know we have lots

00:32:04.386 --> 00:32:07.046 A:middle
of great Apple devices and one

00:32:07.046 --> 00:32:08.536 A:middle
of the great things about Xcode

00:32:08.536 --> 00:32:10.326 A:middle
is that with just a few build

00:32:10.326 --> 00:32:11.856 A:middle
settings you can target your

00:32:11.856 --> 00:32:13.596 A:middle
code for each of these devices.

00:32:13.966 --> 00:32:17.356 A:middle
And so under the hood in macOS,

00:32:17.356 --> 00:32:20.456 A:middle
iOS, watchOS, etcetera we tweak

00:32:20.826 --> 00:32:22.966 A:middle
every OS so that it uses

00:32:22.966 --> 00:32:24.766 A:middle
everything that's available on a

00:32:24.766 --> 00:32:25.986 A:middle
specific piece of hardware.

00:32:26.476 --> 00:32:27.516 A:middle
So it guarantees maximum

00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:29.146 A:middle
performance no matter where we

00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:29.436 A:middle
run.

00:32:29.796 --> 00:32:32.856 A:middle
And so if you an app with

00:32:33.206 --> 00:32:34.736 A:middle
extremely high-performance

00:32:34.736 --> 00:32:35.966 A:middle
requirements that's something

00:32:35.966 --> 00:32:37.156 A:middle
that you might want to do as

00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:37.356 A:middle
well.

00:32:39.516 --> 00:32:41.146 A:middle
So we have three features to

00:32:41.146 --> 00:32:42.916 A:middle
talk about that are available in

00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:44.656 A:middle
the iMac Pro and the iPhone 8

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:45.946 A:middle
Plus and X.

00:32:46.836 --> 00:32:49.046 A:middle
And let's start with the iMac

00:32:50.996 --> 00:32:51.106 A:middle
Pro.

00:32:51.316 --> 00:32:53.186 A:middle
So the iMac Pro has the Intel

00:32:53.186 --> 00:32:58.006 A:middle
Xeon CPU which has a set of new

00:32:58.006 --> 00:32:59.886 A:middle
features called AVX-512.

00:32:59.886 --> 00:33:03.536 A:middle
So AVX-512 is a set of new
