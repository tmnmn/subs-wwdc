00:27:58.616 --> 00:28:00.136 A:middle
have a little bit of code right

00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:01.256 A:middle
before the return of the

00:28:01.256 --> 00:28:02.796 A:middle
function that checks whether the

00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:04.406 A:middle
canary is still valid.

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:07.676 A:middle
So if we keep writing in strcpy

00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:08.826 A:middle
we're going to override the

00:28:08.826 --> 00:28:12.666 A:middle
canary first and then we're

00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:14.126 A:middle
going to check the canary first

00:28:14.126 --> 00:28:16.246 A:middle
before returning and that's

00:28:16.246 --> 00:28:16.866 A:middle
going to abort.

00:28:17.686 --> 00:28:19.076 A:middle
So we turned ad potentially

00:28:19.076 --> 00:28:20.276 A:middle
exploitable security

00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:22.516 A:middle
vulnerability into a reliable

00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:24.366 A:middle
crash and that's not good for an

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:24.766 A:middle
attacker.

00:28:25.386 --> 00:28:27.506 A:middle
So this is what's called the

00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:27.966 A:middle
Stack Protector.

00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:34.896 A:middle
It defects certain kinds of

00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:36.306 A:middle
stack buffer overflows, which is

00:28:36.306 --> 00:28:37.346 A:middle
the attack that we just saw.

00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:39.466 A:middle
And it's already enabled by

00:28:39.466 --> 00:28:41.096 A:middle
default in many versions of

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:41.416 A:middle
Xcode.

00:28:41.976 --> 00:28:45.856 A:middle
So next I'm going to talk about

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:47.596 A:middle
a trickier case where we

00:28:47.676 --> 00:28:48.866 A:middle
introduced a new mitigation.

00:28:48.986 --> 00:28:52.346 A:middle
So let's say I took my function,

00:28:52.986 --> 00:28:55.346 A:middle
again my dlog function and I

00:28:55.346 --> 00:28:56.616 A:middle
changed the buffer so that now

00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:57.776 A:middle
it's a variable length array.

00:28:58.856 --> 00:29:00.426 A:middle
And the length comes from a
