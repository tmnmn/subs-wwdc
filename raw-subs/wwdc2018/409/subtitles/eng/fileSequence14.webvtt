00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:03.556 A:middle
remove this fixated layout and

00:14:03.556 --> 00:14:05.346 A:middle
to ensure that our structure is

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:05.956 A:middle
tightly packed.

00:14:07.436 --> 00:14:08.766 A:middle
This can be useful when

00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.146 A:middle
serializing your structures or

00:14:11.146 --> 00:14:12.296 A:middle
when transferring your

00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:13.576 A:middle
structures over the network.

00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:16.976 A:middle
Now pragma pack is typically

00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:19.036 A:middle
used with a push and a pop

00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:21.386 A:middle
directive, but it can be easy

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:23.526 A:middle
for the programmer to forget to

00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:25.416 A:middle
insert the pop into the code.

00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:29.346 A:middle
Xcode 10 will now warn about

00:14:29.376 --> 00:14:31.526 A:middle
code that doesn't have a

00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:33.526 A:middle
corresponding pragma pack pop

00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:36.036 A:middle
directive and to point you to

00:14:36.036 --> 00:14:37.516 A:middle
the location of the push.

00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:41.426 A:middle
So to fix this warning you

00:14:41.426 --> 00:14:42.866 A:middle
should take a look at the

00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:44.586 A:middle
location of your push directive

00:14:45.156 --> 00:14:47.716 A:middle
and insert the pop directive at

00:14:47.716 --> 00:14:49.706 A:middle
the corresponding location in

00:14:49.706 --> 00:14:50.376 A:middle
your code.

00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:53.426 A:middle
So in our case we can insert the

00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:55.296 A:middle
pop directly after the packed

00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:55.836 A:middle
structure.

00:14:57.186 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
Once we do that the new layout
