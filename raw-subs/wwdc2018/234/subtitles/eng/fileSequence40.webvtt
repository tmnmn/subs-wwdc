00:40:02.256 --> 00:40:03.616 A:middle
Here's the constructor for the

00:40:03.616 --> 00:40:04.596 A:middle
Payment Request API.

00:40:05.456 --> 00:40:07.406 A:middle
It accepts three arguments.

00:40:07.596 --> 00:40:10.466 A:middle
We'll start by adding the

00:40:10.466 --> 00:40:13.036 A:middle
paymentMethod data object.

00:40:16.636 --> 00:40:18.456 A:middle
This contains the Apple Pay

00:40:18.456 --> 00:40:20.826 A:middle
paymentMethod identifier, along

00:40:20.826 --> 00:40:22.256 A:middle
with some options specific to

00:40:22.256 --> 00:40:26.496 A:middle
Apple Pay.

00:40:26.696 --> 00:40:29.396 A:middle
Following that, are the payment

00:40:29.396 --> 00:40:29.956 A:middle
details.

00:40:30.406 --> 00:40:31.976 A:middle
This is where we specify details

00:40:31.976 --> 00:40:33.716 A:middle
about the transaction, such as

00:40:33.716 --> 00:40:35.366 A:middle
my website's name, the total

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.086 A:middle
amount, and each line time.

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:40.546 A:middle
I kept things simple, and

00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:41.556 A:middle
decided that I'm just going to

00:40:41.556 --> 00:40:43.396 A:middle
charge $5 for everything on this

00:40:43.396 --> 00:40:43.696 A:middle
list.

00:40:48.076 --> 00:40:50.346 A:middle
Finally, the options argument

00:40:50.776 --> 00:40:52.466 A:middle
specifies what information I

00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:54.006 A:middle
need to collect from my user to

00:40:54.006 --> 00:40:55.206 A:middle
complete the transaction.

00:40:55.746 --> 00:40:58.626 A:middle
Let's switch back to the iPad

00:40:58.626 --> 00:41:01.606 A:middle
and add some supplies to my
