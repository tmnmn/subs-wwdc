00:29:00.076 --> 00:29:02.086 A:middle
So, that's just four of the many

00:29:02.086 --> 00:29:03.276 A:middle
new security performance

00:29:03.276 --> 00:29:04.836 A:middle
features in Safari and WebKit.

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.626 A:middle
I hope you'll take advantage of

00:29:07.626 --> 00:29:08.766 A:middle
them on your own site, and I

00:29:08.766 --> 00:29:09.906 A:middle
think your users will thank you

00:29:09.906 --> 00:29:10.866 A:middle
for it.

00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:11.936 A:middle
Now, I'd like to welcome Shloka

00:29:11.936 --> 00:29:13.256 A:middle
back up on the stage to tell you

00:29:13.256 --> 00:29:14.506 A:middle
about even more new and exciting

00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:14.666 A:middle
features.

00:29:14.666 --> 00:29:14.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:21.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:25.186 --> 00:29:26.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jason.

00:29:26.656 --> 00:29:30.036 A:middle
And, I had no idea it was that

00:29:30.036 --> 00:29:31.246 A:middle
brutal in the blogosphere.

00:29:33.346 --> 00:29:34.336 A:middle
You stay safe out there.

00:29:37.086 --> 00:29:38.496 A:middle
And, thank you so much for that

00:29:38.496 --> 00:29:39.106 A:middle
great demo.

00:29:39.726 --> 00:29:41.686 A:middle
To recap performance, using font

00:29:41.686 --> 00:29:43.566 A:middle
collections can reduce font file

00:29:43.566 --> 00:29:44.086 A:middle
sizes.

00:29:44.376 --> 00:29:46.276 A:middle
The font-display property lets

00:29:46.276 --> 00:29:47.876 A:middle
you have more control over what

00:29:47.876 --> 00:29:49.356 A:middle
happens with custom fonts.

00:29:50.066 --> 00:29:51.776 A:middle
Using videos in image elements

00:29:51.826 --> 00:29:53.026 A:middle
can help with performance

00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:53.766 A:middle
instead of GIFs.

00:29:54.446 --> 00:29:55.876 A:middle
Passive event listeners can

00:29:55.876 --> 00:29:57.606 A:middle
improve scrolling, and using

00:29:57.606 --> 00:29:59.316 A:middle
asynchronous calls, both with

00:29:59.316 --> 00:30:01.326 A:middle
the Beacon API, and with image
