00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:00.116 A:middle
do, is if you have a legacy

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:02.356 A:middle
Safari extension, switch over to

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:03.736 A:middle
a Safari app extension.

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:05.086 A:middle
And, if it happens to be an ad

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:07.086 A:middle
blocker, use content blockers.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:08.996 A:middle
And now that we've done all this

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:11.136 A:middle
work, what can we do about the

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.396 A:middle
use of legacy Safari extensions

00:06:13.396 --> 00:06:14.266 A:middle
for fraud?

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:17.566 A:middle
Starting with Safari 12, we're

00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:19.556 A:middle
officially blocking support for

00:06:19.556 --> 00:06:21.376 A:middle
legacy extensions distributed

00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:23.196 A:middle
outside of the Safari Extensions

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:23.666 A:middle
Gallery.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.126 A:middle
Legacy extensions will still

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:28.896 A:middle
work in Safari 12 as long as

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:29.796 A:middle
they're in the Gallery.

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:32.316 A:middle
The only exception are those

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:33.986 A:middle
extensions using the deprecated

00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:36.016 A:middle
Can Load API, which we turn off

00:06:36.016 --> 00:06:36.666 A:middle
by default.

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:38.566 A:middle
We'll continue to accept

00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:40.466 A:middle
submissions to the Gallery until

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:41.706 A:middle
the end of 2018.

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:44.106 A:middle
However, we will be coming up

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:45.386 A:middle
with more updates in the

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:46.406 A:middle
following year, and will

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.386 A:middle
eventually transition entirely

00:06:48.716 --> 00:06:50.166 A:middle
to Safari app extensions.

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:52.066 A:middle
So, the best thing for you to do

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:53.166 A:middle
is learn how to develop

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:54.626 A:middle
extensions in these two models.

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.106 A:middle
And, to learn how to do that,

00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:58.576 A:middle
check out the docs, courtesy of

00:06:58.576 --> 00:06:59.586 A:middle
