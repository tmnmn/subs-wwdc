00:16:00.556 --> 00:16:01.446 A:middle
Now, if you adopt this

00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:03.706 A:middle
technique, in the simplest way,

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:05.876 A:middle
you could come up with a version

00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:07.556 A:middle
that isn't compatible with older

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:08.086 A:middle
browsers.

00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:10.086 A:middle
Older browsers don't support

00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:11.286 A:middle
MP4s and image elements.

00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:13.916 A:middle
Luckily, using existing

00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:16.216 A:middle
technology, you can specify a

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.536 A:middle
fallback image to display if the

00:16:18.536 --> 00:16:19.466 A:middle
MP4 doesn't work.

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:22.636 A:middle
Now, listen up, because now

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.876 A:middle
we're going to move on to event

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:26.926 A:middle
listeners.

00:16:27.306 --> 00:16:29.606 A:middle
Yes? No. Another feature that

00:16:29.606 --> 00:16:31.476 A:middle
has some great defaults, and

00:16:31.476 --> 00:16:33.016 A:middle
some customizability in special

00:16:33.016 --> 00:16:33.466 A:middle
cases.

00:16:34.556 --> 00:16:36.286 A:middle
When any user tries to navigate

00:16:36.286 --> 00:16:37.536 A:middle
a web page with a touch screen,

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:39.096 A:middle
they're going to need to scroll.

00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:40.976 A:middle
And, for every touch to scroll,

00:16:41.206 --> 00:16:42.896 A:middle
a touch event listener can fire,

00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:45.506 A:middle
which can interrupt scrolling

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:47.726 A:middle
and cause it to jump a little.

00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:49.476 A:middle
Take a look at these two

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:49.966 A:middle
examples.

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:52.896 A:middle
Now, the one on the left is

00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:55.546 A:middle
interrupted much more than the

00:16:55.546 --> 00:16:56.156 A:middle
one on the right.

00:16:56.536 --> 00:16:57.606 A:middle
I mean, it's barely moving.

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.966 A:middle
So, what's the one on the right
