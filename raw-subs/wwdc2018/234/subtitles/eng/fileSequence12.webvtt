00:11:59.816 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
tool, to help you test

00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:02.766 A:middle
compatibility with automatic

00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:04.686 A:middle
strong passwords, and develop

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:06.646 A:middle
your own password rules.

00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:09.776 A:middle
Another feature mentioned in the

00:12:09.776 --> 00:12:11.736 A:middle
State of the Union, security

00:12:11.786 --> 00:12:13.316 A:middle
code AutoFill.

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:14.656 A:middle
Another feature most of you will

00:12:14.656 --> 00:12:15.336 A:middle
get for free.

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:17.136 A:middle
This is one I'm going to be

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.936 A:middle
making good use for, because I

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:20.256 A:middle
find it tedious to switch

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.536 A:middle
between my app and the website,

00:12:22.536 --> 00:12:24.076 A:middle
and the messages, and then find

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.636 A:middle
out those numbers for the code,

00:12:25.636 --> 00:12:27.016 A:middle
and input it and try to remember

00:12:27.016 --> 00:12:27.126 A:middle
it.

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:29.096 A:middle
So, having Safari figure out

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:30.916 A:middle
when I have to input a security

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.246 A:middle
code, and then suggesting it in

00:12:32.246 --> 00:12:33.106 A:middle
the quick type bar?

00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:35.556 A:middle
Makes this much more convenient.

00:12:36.346 --> 00:12:38.206 A:middle
And, just like before, you get

00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:40.206 A:middle
this feature for free, because

00:12:40.356 --> 00:12:41.666 A:middle
it uses heuristics, but to

00:12:41.666 --> 00:12:43.246 A:middle
ensure that these heuristics

00:12:43.246 --> 00:12:44.786 A:middle
work, and you get that quick

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:47.596 A:middle
type suggestion, mark your input

00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.236 A:middle
fields with the one-time code

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:50.896 A:middle
value in the AutoComplete

00:12:51.026 --> 00:12:51.596 A:middle
attribute.

00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:53.806 A:middle
For more details, I encourage

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.426 A:middle
you to check out the Automatic

00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:56.936 A:middle
Strong Passwords and Security

00:12:56.936 --> 00:12:58.956 A:middle
Code AutoFill session online.

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:01.946 A:middle
So, that's security.
