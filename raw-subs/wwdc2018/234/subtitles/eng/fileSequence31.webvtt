00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:01.226 A:middle
will drop the name of that

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.506 A:middle
element and its price into my

00:31:03.506 --> 00:31:03.846 A:middle
cart.

00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:05.916 A:middle
Now, you can specify what

00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:07.236 A:middle
happens with drag and drop

00:31:07.266 --> 00:31:08.696 A:middle
behavior, which lets you

00:31:08.696 --> 00:31:10.316 A:middle
implement richer user

00:31:10.446 --> 00:31:11.186 A:middle
interactions.

00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:14.706 A:middle
Next, we move into the API

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.146 A:middle
section of this talk, starting

00:31:16.146 --> 00:31:17.896 A:middle
with the Payment Request API and

00:31:18.246 --> 00:31:18.936 A:middle
Apple Pay.

00:31:19.616 --> 00:31:20.916 A:middle
So, let's talk about Apple Pay.

00:31:21.316 --> 00:31:22.646 A:middle
Apple Pay's not just a way to

00:31:22.646 --> 00:31:22.926 A:middle
pay.

00:31:22.926 --> 00:31:24.516 A:middle
It's a way to rethink electronic

00:31:24.566 --> 00:31:25.666 A:middle
payments entirely.

00:31:26.046 --> 00:31:28.036 A:middle
With Apple Pay, vendors won't

00:31:28.036 --> 00:31:29.466 A:middle
directly receive credit card

00:31:29.466 --> 00:31:31.376 A:middle
information of your customers,

00:31:31.376 --> 00:31:32.576 A:middle
which keeps them more secure.

00:31:33.466 --> 00:31:34.676 A:middle
Now, we know that many of you

00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:36.336 A:middle
have been requesting a way to

00:31:36.336 --> 00:31:37.616 A:middle
support Apple Pay using a

00:31:37.686 --> 00:31:38.326 A:middle
standard API.

00:31:39.096 --> 00:31:40.516 A:middle
And, I'm pleased to tell you, we

00:31:40.516 --> 00:31:42.246 A:middle
listened, and with collaborative

00:31:42.246 --> 00:31:44.456 A:middle
efforts, Apple Pay now works

00:31:44.456 --> 00:31:46.596 A:middle
with the W3C Payment Request

00:31:46.746 --> 00:31:46.936 A:middle
API.

00:31:50.516 --> 00:31:53.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:54.366 --> 00:31:56.116 A:middle
So, while you have the option to

00:31:56.116 --> 00:31:58.906 A:middle
use this API, remember that to

00:31:58.906 --> 00:32:00.416 A:middle
get the benefits of Apple Pay
