00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.606 A:middle
out some great features in

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:01.596 A:middle
Safari and WebKit.

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:03.486 A:middle
So, if you develop websites, and

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:05.385 A:middle
want to make use of the latest

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:06.926 A:middle

versions of Safari, this talk is

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:09.336 A:middle
for you.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:10.706 A:middle
And, if you're a native app

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.426 A:middle
developer that uses web views,

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:14.876 A:middle
or extensions developers, this

talk is for you, too.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.486 A:middle
And, even if you're not in any

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:18.476 A:middle
of these categories, you should

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:20.136 A:middle
still stick around, because the

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.726 A:middle
latest version of Safari has

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.036 A:middle
some great features that will

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:23.906 A:middle
improve your browsing

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:24.466 A:middle
experience.

00:01:25.226 --> 00:01:28.076 A:middle
Now, there've been a lot-- a

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:29.936 A:middle
lot-- of new improvements since

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:31.256 A:middle
we last had a What's New talk.

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:32.626 A:middle
But, today I'm going to

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.046 A:middle
highlight a few that can really

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:35.936 A:middle
help you get secure, performant

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:38.156 A:middle
apps, and use the latest web

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:39.236 A:middle
technologies for a rich

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:39.986 A:middle
experience.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.316 A:middle
And, many of them you can get

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:41.766 A:middle
for free.

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:43.986 A:middle
So, let's kick things off with

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:44.616 A:middle
security.

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:45.956 A:middle
And, a few announcements.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:49.496 A:middle
WKWebView.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:50.156 A:middle
Now, I know what you're

00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:50.856 A:middle
thinking.

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:53.096 A:middle
WKWebView has been around since

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:57.956 A:middle
2014, so it's not technically

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:58.086 A:middle

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
