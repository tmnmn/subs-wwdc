00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:01.176 A:middle
cases, you have two options.

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:03.436 A:middle
One, you can add the decoding

00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:05.176 A:middle
async attribute to your images

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:06.136 A:middle
elements in markup.

00:19:06.756 --> 00:19:09.536 A:middle
Or, you can use the JavaScript

00:19:09.536 --> 00:19:11.996 A:middle
API's HTMLImageElements.decode

00:19:11.996 --> 00:19:13.856 A:middle
method, which returns a promise,

00:19:14.106 --> 00:19:15.726 A:middle
making sure that you know when

00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:17.756 A:middle
an image can be added to the dom

00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:19.546 A:middle
without causing a decoding delay

00:19:19.866 --> 00:19:20.796 A:middle
on the next frame.

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:24.216 A:middle
And, continuing with

00:19:24.216 --> 00:19:26.336 A:middle
asynchronous calls is support

00:19:26.336 --> 00:19:27.416 A:middle
for the Beacon API.

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:29.566 A:middle
We know, as developers, you want

00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:31.466 A:middle
to send data on an unload event.

00:19:31.956 --> 00:19:33.936 A:middle
Perhaps to track outgoing links.

00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:35.896 A:middle
And normally, asynchronous

00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:37.766 A:middle
requests on unload are ignored,

00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:38.776 A:middle
so you're stuck using a

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:40.266 A:middle
synchronous request, which can

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:41.816 A:middle
stall the next page load.

00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:44.206 A:middle
However, we now support the

00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:45.066 A:middle
Beacon API.

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:47.086 A:middle
So, as long as Safari is

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:48.816 A:middle
running, you can send your data

00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:50.866 A:middle
to the server and forget about

00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:52.666 A:middle
it, with the guarantee that it

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:53.466 A:middle
will be delivered.

00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:57.036 A:middle
But, you've heard me talk

00:19:57.036 --> 00:19:57.446 A:middle
enough.

00:19:57.926 --> 00:19:59.096 A:middle
I mean, I'm sure you want to see

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:00.036 A:middle
some of these security and
