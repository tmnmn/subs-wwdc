00:27:58.626 --> 00:28:00.756 A:middle
GIF of a bird furnishing its new

00:28:00.756 --> 00:28:01.196 A:middle
birdhouse.

00:28:01.966 --> 00:28:05.156 A:middle
This image is-- this video's

00:28:05.156 --> 00:28:09.266 A:middle
pretty large-- well, it's a GIF.

00:28:09.406 --> 00:28:10.946 A:middle
Seven-- it's roughly a little

00:28:10.946 --> 00:28:12.236 A:middle
over 7 megabytes.

00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:13.926 A:middle
And, honestly the quality isn't

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:14.366 A:middle
that great.

00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:15.876 A:middle
But, I happen to have the

00:28:15.876 --> 00:28:18.676 A:middle
original H264-encoded MP4, and

00:28:19.226 --> 00:28:20.846 A:middle
now I can just use that directly

00:28:20.846 --> 00:28:21.626 A:middle
on my page.

00:28:22.066 --> 00:28:24.086 A:middle
So, let's go back to my HTML,

00:28:24.926 --> 00:28:25.986 A:middle
and find that image.

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:28.556 A:middle
Here it is.

00:28:28.766 --> 00:28:30.056 A:middle
So, I can just change the

00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:31.846 A:middle
extension to point to the MP4

00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:32.236 A:middle
file.

00:28:33.646 --> 00:28:37.486 A:middle
Reload. And, now I'm using the

00:28:37.486 --> 00:28:38.286 A:middle
actual video.

00:28:38.286 --> 00:28:39.916 A:middle
The quality's a lot better, and

00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:41.366 A:middle
this is only about a megabyte.

00:28:41.906 --> 00:28:43.386 A:middle
Plus, it's a little bit longer

00:28:43.476 --> 00:28:44.606 A:middle
than the animated GIF.

00:28:45.076 --> 00:28:49.096 A:middle
And, as Shloka mentioned, this

00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:50.876 A:middle
can also be used in the source

00:28:50.876 --> 00:28:52.766 A:middle
attribute to provide a fallback

00:28:52.766 --> 00:28:53.686 A:middle
image for browsers that don't

00:28:53.686 --> 00:28:53.966 A:middle
support this.
