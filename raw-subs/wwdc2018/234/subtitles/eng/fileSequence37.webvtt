00:37:01.536 --> 00:37:03.246 A:middle
So, I have this list of all the

00:37:03.246 --> 00:37:04.866 A:middle
supplies that my readers will

00:37:04.866 --> 00:37:05.866 A:middle
need to get started.

00:37:06.856 --> 00:37:07.456 A:middle
And, I thought it'd be

00:37:07.456 --> 00:37:10.906 A:middle
convenient if I could actually

00:37:10.906 --> 00:37:13.226 A:middle
provide them with a way to add

00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:14.156 A:middle
to their shopping list, the

00:37:14.156 --> 00:37:15.406 A:middle
things they might need, and

00:37:15.406 --> 00:37:16.726 A:middle
maybe even purchase some of

00:37:16.726 --> 00:37:18.136 A:middle
these directly from my site.

00:37:18.926 --> 00:37:20.006 A:middle
Plus, I figured I can make a

00:37:20.006 --> 00:37:22.266 A:middle
little extra cash in the

00:37:23.136 --> 00:37:23.326 A:middle
process.

00:37:23.456 --> 00:37:26.456 A:middle
So, I have the ability to drag

00:37:26.456 --> 00:37:28.256 A:middle
and drop the supplies from the

00:37:28.256 --> 00:37:29.976 A:middle
left onto this shopping list.

00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:45.286 A:middle
And, this works great now on my

00:37:45.286 --> 00:37:45.976 A:middle
iPad as well.

00:37:46.076 --> 00:37:48.686 A:middle
So, let's take a look at some of

00:37:48.686 --> 00:37:49.766 A:middle
the code that's used to achieve

00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:49.976 A:middle
this.

00:37:57.046 --> 00:37:57.916 A:middle
Doesn't actually take a lot of

00:37:57.916 --> 00:37:58.856 A:middle
code to do this.

00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
So, for each supply, I add a
