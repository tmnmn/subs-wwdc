00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:00.336 A:middle
And, intelligent tracking

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:01.816 A:middle
prevention can keep the browsing

00:09:01.816 --> 00:09:02.786 A:middle
experience private.

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:04.376 A:middle
Now, I'm sure you heard about

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.826 A:middle
intelligent tracking prevention

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:06.626 A:middle
in the Keynote.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:08.386 A:middle
It's a Safari feature that

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:10.326 A:middle
reduces cross-site tracking by

00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:12.126 A:middle
limiting cookies and website

00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:13.416 A:middle
data for domains with tracking

00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:13.836 A:middle
abilities.

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:15.636 A:middle
And, in previous versions,

00:09:15.906 --> 00:09:17.316 A:middle
cookies were kept according to

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:17.966 A:middle
two rules.

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:19.996 A:middle
One, cookies could be used in

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.276 A:middle
third-party context for 24 hours

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:24.306 A:middle
after user interaction in a

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:25.446 A:middle
first-party context.

00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:28.166 A:middle
And two, for 30 days of Safari

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:30.336 A:middle
use, including that initial 24

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.806 A:middle
hours, those cookies would be

00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:33.856 A:middle
kept in isolated storage before

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:34.556 A:middle
being purged.

00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:37.336 A:middle
But, now we're tightening the

00:09:37.336 --> 00:09:37.936 A:middle
belt a little.

00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:40.856 A:middle
And, we're removing the 24-hour

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:42.516 A:middle
general cookie access window for

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:43.536 A:middle
domains with cross-site

00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:44.036 A:middle
tracking.

00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:47.806 A:middle
But, by default, all cookies are

00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:49.786 A:middle
kept in isolated storage, and as

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.596 A:middle
developers, I know authenticated

00:09:51.596 --> 00:09:53.786 A:middle
embeds are already important to

00:09:54.006 --> 00:09:55.546 A:middle
many of your workflows and

00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:57.036 A:middle
interactions with web content.

00:09:57.686 --> 00:09:58.666 A:middle
So, how do you allow

00:09:59.036 --> 00:09:59.976 A:middle
authenticated embeds?
