00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
So, for each supply, I add a

00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:04.366 A:middle
dragStart eventListener, which

00:38:04.366 --> 00:38:07.576 A:middle
stores the element's text, using

00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:09.556 A:middle
the Data Transfer API.

00:38:10.816 --> 00:38:12.896 A:middle
Then, in my drop zone, which is

00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:15.186 A:middle
my shopping list area, I have a

00:38:15.186 --> 00:38:17.066 A:middle
drop event listener, that

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:18.886 A:middle
retrieves the previously stored

00:38:20.156 --> 00:38:22.286 A:middle
text from the Data Transfer API.

00:38:22.286 --> 00:38:24.046 A:middle
And, appends that to the

00:38:24.046 --> 00:38:24.976 A:middle
shopping list element.

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:30.526 A:middle
Note that you do also need to

00:38:30.526 --> 00:38:32.146 A:middle
add a dragOver eventListener,

00:38:32.636 --> 00:38:34.886 A:middle
and for the area where you want

00:38:34.886 --> 00:38:36.596 A:middle
the element to be dropped, to

00:38:36.596 --> 00:38:39.226 A:middle
prevent the default event, and

00:38:39.226 --> 00:38:41.316 A:middle
indicate that a drop is allowed

00:38:41.316 --> 00:38:42.536 A:middle
on that element.

00:38:43.086 --> 00:38:45.716 A:middle
So, with very little code, I was

00:38:45.716 --> 00:38:47.236 A:middle
able to create this fun shopping

00:38:47.236 --> 00:38:48.986 A:middle
UI that works great on my Mac,

00:38:49.306 --> 00:38:50.786 A:middle
and now on my iPad as well.

00:38:51.076 --> 00:38:54.726 A:middle
So, now that I can place

00:38:54.726 --> 00:38:56.546 A:middle
supplies in my shopping list, I

00:38:56.546 --> 00:38:57.726 A:middle
need a way for my users to

00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:58.756 A:middle
actually make a purchase.

00:38:59.406 --> 00:39:02.726 A:middle
Let's take a look at how we can
