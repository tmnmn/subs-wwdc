And now, when I click this link

00:25:00.676 --> 00:25:02.256 A:middle
you'll see it's nearly instant.

00:25:02.296 --> 00:25:03.216 A:middle
I'm going to click the link

00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:03.696 A:middle
right now.

00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:05.056 A:middle
And, there we go.

00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:08.746 A:middle
So, compared to the XML/http

00:25:08.746 --> 00:25:10.576 A:middle
request this is even less code,

00:25:10.576 --> 00:25:11.796 A:middle
and it's just as reliable.

00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:13.696 A:middle
And now, it'll be much faster

00:25:13.696 --> 00:25:14.826 A:middle
for my users to navigate around

00:25:14.826 --> 00:25:14.976 A:middle
my site.

00:25:15.516 --> 00:25:17.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:18.236 --> 00:25:22.956 A:middle
Thanks. So, next I want to take

00:25:22.956 --> 00:25:24.036 A:middle
a look at a problem that I've

00:25:24.036 --> 00:25:25.446 A:middle
noticed is more apparent on my

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:25.956 A:middle
iPad here.

00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:34.666 A:middle
So, I've organized each step for

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.016 A:middle
building this birdhouse as a

00:25:36.016 --> 00:25:37.386 A:middle
slide in this crossfading

00:25:37.386 --> 00:25:37.926 A:middle
carousel.

00:25:39.776 --> 00:25:41.596 A:middle
Tapping the right-facing arrow

00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:42.916 A:middle
advances this to the next slide.

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.856 A:middle
But, you may have noticed that

00:25:45.856 --> 00:25:48.066 A:middle
brief moment of a blank white

00:25:48.176 --> 00:25:49.826 A:middle
space where the image should be.

00:25:50.286 --> 00:25:51.446 A:middle
Let me go through a few more

00:25:51.446 --> 00:25:51.846 A:middle
slides.

00:25:56.066 --> 00:25:57.316 A:middle
Let's take a look at some of the

00:25:57.316 --> 00:25:58.636 A:middle
code for this carousel, and see

00:25:58.636 --> 00:25:59.356 A:middle
what's going on.

00:25:59.356 --> 00:26:00.326 A:middle
I think this can be a lot
