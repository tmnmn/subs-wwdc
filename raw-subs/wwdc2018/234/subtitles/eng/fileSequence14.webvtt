00:14:00.566 --> 00:14:01.046 A:middle
collections.

00:14:01.656 --> 00:14:03.496 A:middle
Bundling related fonts together

00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:05.076 A:middle
inside a single collection file

00:14:05.316 --> 00:14:07.076 A:middle
can eliminate duplicated tables

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:08.796 A:middle
for character maps.

00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:10.746 A:middle
For example, one of our built-in

00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:13.626 A:middle
fonts, PingFang has an 84%

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:15.286 A:middle
reduction of file size from

00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:16.046 A:middle
using a collection.

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:17.826 A:middle
Font collections can

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.736 A:middle
substantially reduce the size of

00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:21.136 A:middle
your font files, because the

00:14:21.136 --> 00:14:23.296 A:middle
fonts share a table for the same

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:23.956 A:middle
character set.

00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:27.226 A:middle
Now, this next feature,

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:29.776 A:middle
font-display, requires no change

00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:30.826 A:middle
for most developers.

00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:32.826 A:middle
Essentially if you have web

00:14:32.826 --> 00:14:34.746 A:middle
content that uses custom fonts,

00:14:35.146 --> 00:14:36.576 A:middle
if they don't display for your

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:38.496 A:middle
user for whatever reason, by

00:14:38.496 --> 00:14:40.116 A:middle
default we leave a blank

00:14:40.276 --> 00:14:42.076 A:middle
placeholder for the text for up

00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:44.386 A:middle
to three seconds, before your

00:14:44.386 --> 00:14:46.206 A:middle
font displays, to maintain the

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:47.866 A:middle
position of all the content on

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:48.376 A:middle
the screen.

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:51.166 A:middle
But, if this default behavior

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:52.686 A:middle
isn't quite right for you, and

00:14:52.686 --> 00:14:54.006 A:middle
you want to have more control

00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:55.616 A:middle
over what happens instead of

00:14:55.616 --> 00:14:57.446 A:middle
those three seconds, you can use

00:14:57.446 --> 00:14:59.136 A:middle
the font-display descriptor.

00:14:59.806 --> 00:15:01.066 A:middle
Using different values, you can
