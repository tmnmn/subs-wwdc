[ Applause ]

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:09.076 A:middle
Now that we've covered the two

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:11.316 A:middle
biggest announcements for native

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:12.866 A:middle
developers using WebViews, and

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.376 A:middle
extensions developers, the

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:15.656 A:middle
remainder of these features are

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:17.336 A:middle
primarily going to be about web

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:17.906 A:middle
development.

00:07:18.346 --> 00:07:20.016 A:middle
So, let's start with subresource

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:20.756 A:middle
integrity.

00:07:21.626 --> 00:07:23.286 A:middle
Now, as a developer, you may

00:07:23.356 --> 00:07:25.396 A:middle
serve your content over an HTTPS

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:26.596 A:middle
connection to your user.

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:28.546 A:middle
And, that resulting content may

00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:31.056 A:middle
also include content distributed

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:33.356 A:middle
over a third-party server, like

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:34.696 A:middle
a content delivery network.

00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:36.876 A:middle
Now, both connections may be

00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:39.316 A:middle
secure, both may use HTTPS,

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:40.906 A:middle
which means you maintain the

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:43.156 A:middle
confidentiality, authentication,

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:44.616 A:middle
and integrity of the data

00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:45.216 A:middle
transferred.

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:48.326 A:middle
But, what happens if that third

00:07:48.326 --> 00:07:50.686 A:middle
party itself is compromised?

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:51.726 A:middle
It could happen.

00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:54.526 A:middle
And, in this case, while HTTPS

00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:56.256 A:middle
secures the connection, it

00:07:56.256 --> 00:07:57.446 A:middle
doesn't secure against a

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.816 A:middle
compromised server.

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.356 A:middle
It can modify the scripts, and
