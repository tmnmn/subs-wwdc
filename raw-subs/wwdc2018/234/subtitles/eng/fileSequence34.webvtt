00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:00.286 A:middle
appears.

00:34:00.526 --> 00:34:02.586 A:middle
And, after a short delay, if the

00:34:02.586 --> 00:34:04.646 A:middle
content is playing, the button

00:34:04.646 --> 00:34:05.266 A:middle
will disappear.

00:34:07.536 --> 00:34:08.976 A:middle
Now, if you're presenting

00:34:08.976 --> 00:34:10.505 A:middle
content that ends up being

00:34:10.505 --> 00:34:12.126 A:middle
blocked by this Cancel button,

00:34:12.356 --> 00:34:14.186 A:middle
you can use the CSS Environment

00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:16.646 A:middle
Variable fullscreen-inset-top to

00:34:16.646 --> 00:34:17.045 A:middle
avoid it.

00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.485 A:middle
You can also have your content

00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:21.985 A:middle
hide at the same time as the

00:34:21.985 --> 00:34:23.545 A:middle
button, by using the

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.286 A:middle
fullscreen-auto-hide-delay

00:34:25.436 --> 00:34:26.416 A:middle
environment variable.

00:34:26.906 --> 00:34:31.386 A:middle
Last, a couple of cool callouts,

00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:33.525 A:middle
starting with AR.

00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:35.755 A:middle
Oh, you've heard so much about

00:34:35.755 --> 00:34:37.126 A:middle
AR at this conference so far.

00:34:37.356 --> 00:34:39.335 A:middle
And now, you can add AR models

00:34:39.335 --> 00:34:40.846 A:middle
to your UI with image

00:34:40.846 --> 00:34:41.366 A:middle
thumbnails.

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:42.866 A:middle
So, your websites can take

00:34:42.866 --> 00:34:45.036 A:middle
advantage of the brand-new AR

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:45.505 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:34:45.536 --> 00:34:47.246 A:middle
And, the code's fairly short.

00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:48.806 A:middle
You start with an anchor tag,

00:34:49.065 --> 00:34:50.876 A:middle
set the del attribute to "AR"

00:34:51.235 --> 00:34:53.106 A:middle
and set the HREF link to your

00:34:53.306 --> 00:34:55.065 A:middle
USDZ file, then you file format

00:34:55.065 --> 00:34:55.886 A:middle
for AR models.

00:34:56.426 --> 00:34:58.076 A:middle
You add a single child, either

00:34:58.076 --> 00:34:59.426 A:middle
an image or a picture element

00:34:59.666 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
containing an image of the
