00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:03.516 A:middle
So, the value of this attribute

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:06.266 A:middle
is the hashing algorithm that

00:22:06.266 --> 00:22:07.406 A:middle
was used to generate the

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:09.316 A:middle
checksum for the file that I

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:12.586 A:middle
expect my users to see.

00:22:12.826 --> 00:22:14.196 A:middle
I've already prepared a hash

00:22:14.316 --> 00:22:15.566 A:middle
with SHA256.

00:22:16.896 --> 00:22:20.156 A:middle
Next, a hyphen, and then a

00:22:20.156 --> 00:22:22.336 A:middle
base64 representation of the

00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:22.786 A:middle
hash.

00:22:24.006 --> 00:22:26.296 A:middle
Now, let's save this, go back to

00:22:26.296 --> 00:22:28.256 A:middle
our page, reload.

00:22:29.436 --> 00:22:30.866 A:middle
And, we'll see there's no

00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:31.326 A:middle
styles.

00:22:31.876 --> 00:22:32.916 A:middle
Because the hash for the

00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:34.666 A:middle
downloaded file doesn't match

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:36.026 A:middle
the hash in the HTML.

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:38.396 A:middle
So, Safari has blocked it from

00:22:38.396 --> 00:22:38.986 A:middle
being loaded.

00:22:41.916 --> 00:22:43.376 A:middle
Now, let's connect to my CDN.

00:22:43.376 --> 00:22:46.256 A:middle
And, here's my backup on my

00:22:46.256 --> 00:22:46.726 A:middle
desktop.

00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:50.786 A:middle
Let's drag in my backup to the

00:22:50.886 --> 00:22:53.456 A:middle
CDN, replace the compromised

00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:53.876 A:middle
file.

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:57.036 A:middle
And now, when we reload, that

00:22:57.356 --> 00:22:57.976 A:middle
looks a lot better.

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:01.936 A:middle
