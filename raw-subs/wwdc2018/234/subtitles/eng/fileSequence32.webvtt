00:31:58.906 --> 00:32:00.416 A:middle
get the benefits of Apple Pay

00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:02.036 A:middle
for you and your customers, you

00:32:02.036 --> 00:32:03.446 A:middle
will need to make a few changes.

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:05.806 A:middle
For example, adding an Apple Pay

00:32:05.806 --> 00:32:07.376 A:middle
button to your interface, rather

00:32:07.376 --> 00:32:08.836 A:middle
than adding Apple Pay as an

00:32:08.836 --> 00:32:10.376 A:middle
extra option in existing

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:11.016 A:middle
checkout flow.

00:32:11.826 --> 00:32:13.186 A:middle
And, at the moment there are a

00:32:13.326 --> 00:32:15.856 A:middle
few features incorporated in the

00:32:15.856 --> 00:32:18.266 A:middle
Payment Request API, like

00:32:19.176 --> 00:32:20.706 A:middle
granular error-handling,

00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:22.356 A:middle
handling cobranded cards, and

00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:23.136 A:middle
phonetic names.

00:32:23.226 --> 00:32:25.006 A:middle
Features that only appear in

00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:25.676 A:middle
Apple Pay JS.

00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:28.176 A:middle
So, if you need those specific

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.776 A:middle
features for Apple Pay, use

00:32:30.776 --> 00:32:32.496 A:middle
Apple Pay JS.

00:32:33.416 --> 00:32:35.586 A:middle
The next API we're supporting is

00:32:35.666 --> 00:32:37.166 A:middle
the Service Worker API.

00:32:39.716 --> 00:32:42.036 A:middle
And, if your user's network

00:32:42.036 --> 00:32:43.536 A:middle
connection isn't ideal, maybe--

00:32:43.846 --> 00:32:45.306 A:middle
I don't know, they have poor

00:32:45.306 --> 00:32:47.016 A:middle
connectivity, or they're

00:32:47.016 --> 00:32:48.636 A:middle
completely offline, you want to

00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:49.866 A:middle
make sure that you handle that

00:32:49.866 --> 00:32:50.956 A:middle
situation gracefully.

00:32:51.106 --> 00:32:52.326 A:middle
And Service Workers can do that.

00:32:52.946 --> 00:32:54.576 A:middle
A Service Worker is registered

00:32:54.576 --> 00:32:56.506 A:middle
by a unique origin, and it can

00:32:56.506 --> 00:32:58.336 A:middle
cache offline interactions, and

00:32:58.436 --> 00:33:00.336 A:middle
intercept requests made by
