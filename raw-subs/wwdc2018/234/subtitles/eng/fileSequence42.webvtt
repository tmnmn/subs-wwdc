00:41:59.626 --> 00:42:01.026 A:middle
obtaining a payment session from

00:42:01.026 --> 00:42:02.076 A:middle
the Apple Pay server.

00:42:02.346 --> 00:42:04.396 A:middle
To learn more about that, please

00:42:04.426 --> 00:42:06.476 A:middle
see the sessions page on the

00:42:06.476 --> 00:42:08.056 A:middle
Apple developer website for

00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:09.046 A:middle
links to those additional

00:42:09.046 --> 00:42:09.626 A:middle
resources.

00:42:11.076 --> 00:42:14.256 A:middle
Now, finally, I realize I

00:42:14.256 --> 00:42:15.446 A:middle
haven't given a glimpse of my

00:42:15.446 --> 00:42:18.716 A:middle
readers-- what they're actually

00:42:18.946 --> 00:42:19.536 A:middle
building.

00:42:20.326 --> 00:42:21.956 A:middle
So, I want to add an image near

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:23.826 A:middle
the top of my page of the final

00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:24.296 A:middle
product.

00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:27.266 A:middle
But, why stop at a static image?

00:42:27.266 --> 00:42:28.236 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if you

00:42:28.236 --> 00:42:29.626 A:middle
could actually see the birdhouse

00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:31.206 A:middle
in your own environment, get a

00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:32.206 A:middle
sense of its size?

00:42:33.106 --> 00:42:34.486 A:middle
So, with the new AR Quick Look

00:42:34.486 --> 00:42:36.066 A:middle
feature in iOS 12, we can do

00:42:36.066 --> 00:42:36.736 A:middle
this with just a few lines of

00:42:36.736 --> 00:42:36.976 A:middle
code.

00:42:42.296 --> 00:42:43.886 A:middle
So, we'll go into my HTML.

00:42:43.886 --> 00:42:45.916 A:middle
And, I think this is a good

00:42:45.916 --> 00:42:46.606 A:middle
place of it.

00:42:47.586 --> 00:42:49.256 A:middle
So, all I'm doing here is adding

00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:49.736 A:middle
an image.

00:42:50.166 --> 00:42:52.536 A:middle
And, linking to a USDZ file,

00:42:52.866 --> 00:42:53.666 A:middle
that is the model of my

00:42:53.666 --> 00:42:56.226 A:middle
birdhouse, with a rel attribute

00:42:56.336 --> 00:42:56.936 A:middle
of AR.

00:42:57.206 --> 00:43:02.066 A:middle
Switch back to the iPad, and
