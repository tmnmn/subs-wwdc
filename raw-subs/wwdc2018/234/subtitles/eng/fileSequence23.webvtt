[ Applause ]

00:23:02.436 --> 00:23:05.416 A:middle
Thanks. So, with subresource

00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:06.566 A:middle
integrity, I'll be more

00:23:06.566 --> 00:23:08.146 A:middle
confident that my visitors will

00:23:08.146 --> 00:23:09.926 A:middle
see the styles and scripts that

00:23:09.926 --> 00:23:12.686 A:middle
I expect them to get.

00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:13.926 A:middle
Now, let's switch gears a little

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:15.006 A:middle
bit and talk about some

00:23:15.006 --> 00:23:16.166 A:middle
performance improvements we can

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:16.426 A:middle
make.

00:23:16.426 --> 00:23:19.556 A:middle
I found it insightful to know

00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:20.806 A:middle
which links are being clicked on

00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:22.446 A:middle
my site, and which ones aren't.

00:23:22.716 --> 00:23:23.586 A:middle
It helps me make more informed

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:23.976 A:middle
design decisions.

00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:30.956 A:middle
So, I have this click handler

00:23:30.956 --> 00:23:32.106 A:middle
that reports which links are

00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.666 A:middle
being clicked to a server that I

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.176 A:middle
control that aggregates that

00:23:35.176 --> 00:23:35.856 A:middle
data so I can take a look at it

00:23:35.856 --> 00:23:35.976 A:middle
later.

00:23:40.736 --> 00:23:43.106 A:middle
But, notice this delay when I

00:23:43.106 --> 00:23:44.686 A:middle
click on this Woodworking link

00:23:44.846 --> 00:23:45.976 A:middle
that goes to a page that

00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:46.756 A:middle
showcases other

00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:48.616 A:middle
woodworking-related sites on my

00:23:48.616 --> 00:23:49.066 A:middle
page.

00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:51.126 A:middle
I'm going to click the link now.

00:23:52.816 --> 00:23:55.136 A:middle
Took about a half a second to a

00:23:55.136 --> 00:23:59.036 A:middle
second, and this is happening

00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:00.706 A:middle
because I'm making a synchronous
