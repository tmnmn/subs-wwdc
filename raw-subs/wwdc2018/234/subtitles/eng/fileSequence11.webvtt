00:10:59.896 --> 00:11:00.356 A:middle
account.

00:11:00.996 --> 00:11:02.066 A:middle
And, this is good for everyone.

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:03.926 A:middle
I mean, I like to think of

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:05.416 A:middle
myself as someone who chooses

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:06.866 A:middle
strong passwords, but give it a

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.716 A:middle
little bit of time, and I'll

00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:09.956 A:middle
realize that password wasn't as

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:10.746 A:middle
strong as I thought.

00:11:11.256 --> 00:11:12.376 A:middle
And, I probably used it in a

00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:13.066 A:middle
couple places.

00:11:14.276 --> 00:11:15.666 A:middle
For most developers, you won't

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:16.886 A:middle
need to do anything to get this

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:18.436 A:middle
feature, because heuristics will

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:20.156 A:middle
determine if you're on a sign up

00:11:20.156 --> 00:11:21.056 A:middle
or login page.

00:11:21.526 --> 00:11:23.186 A:middle
But, to guarantee this works,

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:26.376 A:middle
regardless of login flow, add

00:11:26.376 --> 00:11:28.086 A:middle
the AutoComplete attribute to

00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:29.446 A:middle
the appropriate input fields.

00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:32.516 A:middle
Now, the strong passwords we

00:11:32.516 --> 00:11:34.466 A:middle
choose are by default 20

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:35.926 A:middle
characters in length, including

00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:38.086 A:middle
upper case, lower case letters,

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:39.426 A:middle
digits and hyphens.

00:11:40.306 --> 00:11:41.436 A:middle
Now, while this was designed to

00:11:41.436 --> 00:11:42.466 A:middle
be compatible with most

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:43.846 A:middle
services, we acknowledge that

00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:45.986 A:middle
sometimes your passwords need to

00:11:45.986 --> 00:11:47.916 A:middle
have specific requirements to be

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.116 A:middle
compatible with the back-end

00:11:49.116 --> 00:11:49.566 A:middle
system.

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:51.516 A:middle
For this reason, there is a

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.486 A:middle
passwordRules attribute that you

00:11:53.486 --> 00:11:55.236 A:middle
can add to your text elements to

00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:56.686 A:middle
specify those requirements.

00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:58.396 A:middle
And, on the developers site,

00:11:58.486 --> 00:11:59.816 A:middle
there's a password validation

00:11:59.816 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
tool, to help you test
