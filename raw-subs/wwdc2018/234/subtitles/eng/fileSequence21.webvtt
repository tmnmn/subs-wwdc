&gt;&gt; Dude! Jason, what did you do?

00:21:01.566 --> 00:21:03.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes, this isn't the elegant

00:21:03.716 --> 00:21:05.226 A:middle
blog I was just bragging about,

00:21:05.226 --> 00:21:06.096 A:middle
is it?

00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:08.526 A:middle
Let's see-- that's the right

00:21:08.526 --> 00:21:08.986 A:middle
URL.

00:21:10.156 --> 00:21:11.806 A:middle
You know, I think I know what

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:12.406 A:middle
happened here.

00:21:12.996 --> 00:21:15.586 A:middle
When I first started this site,

00:21:15.586 --> 00:21:19.436 A:middle
my friends, they warned me that

00:21:19.436 --> 00:21:20.866 A:middle
the lifestyle blogging industry

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:23.516 A:middle
can be pretty cutthroat.

00:21:24.856 --> 00:21:27.176 A:middle
Clearly, this is sabotage.

00:21:27.906 --> 00:21:29.436 A:middle
Someone's replaced my style

00:21:29.436 --> 00:21:30.826 A:middle
sheet on my content delivery

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:31.266 A:middle
network.

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.736 A:middle
But, luckily, I have a backup,

00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:34.396 A:middle
fortunately.

00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:36.536 A:middle
And, we can use subresource

00:21:36.536 --> 00:21:37.936 A:middle
integrity to add a little bit of

00:21:37.936 --> 00:21:39.596 A:middle
an extra layer of security, and

00:21:39.596 --> 00:21:40.706 A:middle
ensure this doesn't happen

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:40.976 A:middle
again.

00:21:46.286 --> 00:21:49.106 A:middle
So, I'll start by adding the new

00:21:49.106 --> 00:21:51.856 A:middle
integrity attribute to my link

00:21:51.856 --> 00:21:52.246 A:middle
tag.

00:21:52.246 --> 00:21:53.896 A:middle
I should also mention this works

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:55.356 A:middle
on scripts, but we're going to

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.046 A:middle
make some changes later, so

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:58.756 A:middle
we'll add that later on.

00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:03.516 A:middle
So, the value of this attribute
