00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:00.036 A:middle
some of these security and

00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:01.316 A:middle
performance features in action.

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:03.056 A:middle
So, I'd like to call Jason onto

00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:04.826 A:middle
the stage to show you how they

00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:05.216 A:middle
all work.

00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:05.826 A:middle
Jason?

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:13.986 A:middle
My name is Jason Sandmeyer, and

00:20:13.986 --> 00:20:15.626 A:middle
I'm a developer on Apple.com.

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:18.046 A:middle
In my free time, I enjoy doing

00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:20.286 A:middle
arts and crafts, like building

00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:22.156 A:middle
birdhouses, and I recently

00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:23.636 A:middle
started this blog to share some

00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:25.116 A:middle
of my projects and inspire

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:25.526 A:middle
others.

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:27.676 A:middle
I spent a lot of time picking

00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:29.146 A:middle
just the right fonts, the right

00:20:29.146 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
colors.

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:31.246 A:middle
I'm pretty proud of it.

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:33.236 A:middle
But, you know what, I don't just

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.696 A:middle
pride myself on good design, I

00:20:34.696 --> 00:20:36.576 A:middle
also pride myself on providing a

00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:38.326 A:middle
good, secure, and performant

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:39.526 A:middle
experience for my users.

00:20:40.056 --> 00:20:41.506 A:middle
So, I'm really excited about all

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:42.756 A:middle
these new performance and

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:44.186 A:middle
security features in WebKit and

00:20:44.186 --> 00:20:46.066 A:middle
Safari, and I really want to

00:20:46.066 --> 00:20:47.646 A:middle
take advantage of them on my own

00:20:48.346 --> 00:20:48.476 A:middle
site.

00:20:48.646 --> 00:20:49.816 A:middle
I'd love to show you how easy

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:50.316 A:middle
that can be.

00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:53.546 A:middle
So, I have my site loaded on my

00:20:53.546 --> 00:20:54.416 A:middle
MacBook Pro here.

00:20:56.716 --> 00:20:58.366 A:middle
And-- whoa.

00:20:58.366 --> 00:20:58.586 A:middle
OK.

00:20:58.586 --> 00:21:01.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dude! Jason, what did you do?
