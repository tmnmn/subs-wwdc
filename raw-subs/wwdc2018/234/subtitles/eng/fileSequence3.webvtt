00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
it's confined to the web view,

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:03.596 A:middle
not the app.

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:05.816 A:middle
WKWebView can provide security

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:07.536 A:middle
benefits while keeping your apps

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.936 A:middle
performant and reliable.

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:10.696 A:middle
So, whether it's hard or easy,

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:12.546 A:middle
the benefits you get using

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.766 A:middle
WKWebView are worth the switch.

00:03:15.316 --> 00:03:18.556 A:middle
The next announcement involves

00:03:18.756 --> 00:03:20.946 A:middle
extensions, but extending

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:24.476 A:middle
Safari-- I mean, it's evolved a

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:25.716 A:middle
lot over the years.

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:27.736 A:middle
So, let me start with a quick

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:30.806 A:middle
recap of the history of Safari

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:31.336 A:middle
extensions.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:34.066 A:middle
Now, in 2010, before we had a

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.496 A:middle
platform concept of app

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:38.116 A:middle
extensibility, we had legacy

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:39.486 A:middle
Safari extensions.

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:42.096 A:middle
Now, these were the Safari EXTZ

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.876 A:middle
files you could build in Safari

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:44.816 A:middle
Extensions Builder.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
They could be distributed

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:47.466 A:middle
through the Safari Extensions

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:49.116 A:middle
Gallery, or in some unusual

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:51.036 A:middle
cases, by developers directly.

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:53.476 A:middle
These legacy extensions were

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:55.216 A:middle
incredibly powerful, because

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.666 A:middle
they had access to all your

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:59.056 A:middle
browsing data, which made them

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:00.896 A:middle
popular, especially for fraud
