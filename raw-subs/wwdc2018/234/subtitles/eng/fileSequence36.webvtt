00:35:59.936 --> 00:36:00.636 A:middle
all the time.

00:36:00.776 --> 00:36:02.716 A:middle
I cannot cook, and I see them in

00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:04.736 A:middle
Messages and emails and now,

00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:06.596 A:middle
when I get that recipe I can see

00:36:06.596 --> 00:36:08.116 A:middle
it right there on my wrist while

00:36:08.116 --> 00:36:09.056 A:middle
I'm following along.

00:36:10.116 --> 00:36:11.256 A:middle
Now, if you use responsive

00:36:11.256 --> 00:36:12.606 A:middle
design, great.

00:36:12.856 --> 00:36:14.136 A:middle
We do all the work for you and

00:36:14.136 --> 00:36:15.126 A:middle
your websites are going to look

00:36:15.156 --> 00:36:16.426 A:middle
great on watchOS.

00:36:16.866 --> 00:36:17.716 A:middle
But, if you would like to

00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:19.326 A:middle
further optimize your webpages

00:36:19.326 --> 00:36:21.086 A:middle
for Apple Watch, there's a video

00:36:21.086 --> 00:36:22.926 A:middle
for Designing Web Content for

00:36:22.926 --> 00:36:24.546 A:middle
watchOS in the WWDC app.

00:36:24.546 --> 00:36:26.056 A:middle
Excuse me.

00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:28.306 A:middle
Designing, yes.

00:36:29.596 --> 00:36:32.476 A:middle
And now, I bet Jason's birdhouse

00:36:32.526 --> 00:36:35.056 A:middle
blog could really up the ante

00:36:35.056 --> 00:36:36.316 A:middle
with some of these great new

00:36:36.316 --> 00:36:37.486 A:middle
rich experience features.

00:36:37.986 --> 00:36:39.416 A:middle
So, I'd like to call Jason back

00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:40.716 A:middle
on the stage to show us how some

00:36:40.716 --> 00:36:41.586 A:middle
of them can be used.

00:36:41.796 --> 00:36:41.976 A:middle
Jason?

00:36:42.516 --> 00:36:46.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:46.606 --> 00:36:47.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks again.

00:36:48.046 --> 00:36:49.256 A:middle
So, I've been thinking about

00:36:49.256 --> 00:36:50.816 A:middle
ways to make it more fun for my

00:36:50.816 --> 00:36:51.996 A:middle
readers to get started with

00:36:51.996 --> 00:36:53.066 A:middle
their birdhouse project.

00:36:53.466 --> 00:36:56.836 A:middle
Let's switch back to the iPad.
