00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
However, it's worth mentioning

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:02.026 A:middle
again because we are now

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:03.636 A:middle
officially deprecating

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:03.976 A:middle
UIWebView.

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:08.996 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.806 A:middle
So, if you're starting a new

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:12.486 A:middle
app, or a new project, and would

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:13.996 A:middle
like to display web content

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:16.346 A:middle
that's not easily put into a

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:18.426 A:middle
native view, use the WKWebView.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.196 A:middle
And, even if you've used

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:21.806 A:middle
UIWebView in the past, switching

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:22.936 A:middle
might be easy for you.

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:24.856 A:middle
It can definitely save you time

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:25.916 A:middle
in development, if you're

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.596 A:middle
developing apps for both macOS

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:30.426 A:middle
and iOS, because WKWebView works

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:31.796 A:middle
on both platforms.

00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:34.396 A:middle
Unlike UIWebView for iOS, and

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:35.336 A:middle
WebView for macOS.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:37.396 A:middle
So, you can share a lot of code

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:38.526 A:middle
between the two versions.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.946 A:middle
WKWebView also runs in a

00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:43.436 A:middle
completely separate process from

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:44.646 A:middle
the rest of your app.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:46.936 A:middle
So, unlike UIWebView, even if

00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:48.746 A:middle
your web process is compromised,

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.816 A:middle
it won't compromise your app.

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:52.386 A:middle
If your web view has complex

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.576 A:middle
content, you can't accidentally

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:55.766 A:middle
cause your app to stall.

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:58.626 A:middle
And, even if WKWebView crashes,

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
it's confined to the web view,
