00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.356 A:middle
But, with asynchronous decoding,

00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:02.546 A:middle
the operations happen in

00:18:02.546 --> 00:18:04.476 A:middle
parallel, and on a separate

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:05.626 A:middle
thread, which means the

00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:07.726 A:middle
interactions aren't blocked.

00:18:08.236 --> 00:18:09.856 A:middle
And now, new this year, async

00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:12.276 A:middle
image decoding happens by

00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:14.226 A:middle
default on the first page load,

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.906 A:middle
which can cover most cases for

00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:17.476 A:middle
web content.

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:20.286 A:middle
However we know that some of you

00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:21.576 A:middle
may have special cases.

00:18:21.656 --> 00:18:24.426 A:middle
Say, you have a tiled map on

00:18:24.426 --> 00:18:26.216 A:middle
your webpage that loads after

00:18:26.216 --> 00:18:27.356 A:middle
the initial page load.

00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:28.986 A:middle
And, if it has lots of images,

00:18:28.986 --> 00:18:31.706 A:middle
some of the tiles may be delayed

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:32.796 A:middle
in their display.

00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:35.716 A:middle
Or, maybe you have a carousel of

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:37.016 A:middle
images in your app that you want

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:38.516 A:middle
to fade into each other, but

00:18:38.516 --> 00:18:40.086 A:middle
when you try to advance the

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.726 A:middle
slides, if the images are

00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:43.296 A:middle
decoded synchronously, they

00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:44.886 A:middle
might not be ready for display.

00:18:45.436 --> 00:18:49.336 A:middle
And, they abruptly switch.

00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:53.216 A:middle
But, on the right, asynchronous

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:54.776 A:middle
decoding gives you a smoother

00:18:54.886 --> 00:18:55.246 A:middle
fade.

00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:58.656 A:middle
Now, if you want to fall into

00:18:58.776 --> 00:18:59.916 A:middle
one of these special dynamic

00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:01.176 A:middle
cases, you have two options.
