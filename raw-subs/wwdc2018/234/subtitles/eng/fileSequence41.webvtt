and add some supplies to my

00:41:01.606 --> 00:41:01.916 A:middle
list.

00:41:11.186 --> 00:41:12.676 A:middle
So, now that we've passed all

00:41:12.676 --> 00:41:13.936 A:middle
the information in, we actually

00:41:13.936 --> 00:41:16.006 A:middle
need to call another method to

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:17.016 A:middle
show the sheet.

00:41:17.286 --> 00:41:20.716 A:middle
And, that's the show method on

00:41:20.716 --> 00:41:21.606 A:middle
the paymentRequest.

00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:23.086 A:middle
And, this method returns a

00:41:23.086 --> 00:41:24.766 A:middle
promise that resolves with a

00:41:24.986 --> 00:41:26.506 A:middle
payment response when the user

00:41:26.506 --> 00:41:28.036 A:middle
authorizes the transaction.

00:41:28.036 --> 00:41:29.546 A:middle
So, [inaudible] with Face ID or

00:41:29.546 --> 00:41:30.206 A:middle
Touch ID.

00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:32.066 A:middle
In here, is where you would

00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:33.446 A:middle
process the transaction.

00:41:33.946 --> 00:41:37.456 A:middle
And then, finally, you'll call

00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:39.846 A:middle
complete with a value of success

00:41:39.846 --> 00:41:41.626 A:middle
or failure, depending on the

00:41:41.626 --> 00:41:42.796 A:middle
state of the transaction.

00:41:42.796 --> 00:41:45.436 A:middle
Alright, now let's check that

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:45.966 A:middle
out on the iPad.

00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:50.976 A:middle
There we go.

00:41:51.516 --> 00:41:56.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:56.546 --> 00:41:58.156 A:middle
So, there are a few additional

00:41:58.156 --> 00:41:59.626 A:middle
steps you'll need to take, like

00:41:59.626 --> 00:42:01.026 A:middle
