00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.356 A:middle
It can modify the scripts, and

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.086 A:middle
styles you serve to users if

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.296 A:middle
that third-party server is

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:05.026 A:middle
compromised.

00:08:06.156 --> 00:08:08.076 A:middle
Subresource integrity ensures

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:09.516 A:middle
that you don't serve compromised

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:10.936 A:middle
scripts to your users.

00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:12.076 A:middle
So, how does it work?

00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:13.566 A:middle
Well, with hashing.

00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:15.626 A:middle
First, you add the integrity

00:08:15.626 --> 00:08:17.196 A:middle
property for a script or link

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:18.306 A:middle
element in your markup.

00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:20.316 A:middle
The value for this property is a

00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:21.786 A:middle
hash that you create using a

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:22.986 A:middle
secure hash algorithm.

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:24.996 A:middle
When a user fetches the files,

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:26.886 A:middle
then another hash is calculated.

00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:28.456 A:middle
The two are compared, and if

00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:30.096 A:middle
they don't match, your script

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:31.106 A:middle
will fail to execute.

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.826 A:middle
This process ensures that

00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:35.535 A:middle
scripts won't execute if they're

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:36.076 A:middle
compromised.

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:38.616 A:middle
Unless they match what you

00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:41.056 A:middle
intended, your scripts will not

00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:41.476 A:middle
execute.

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:43.726 A:middle
And, to make sure you don't lose

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.306 A:middle
functionality, you can also

00:08:45.306 --> 00:08:47.316 A:middle
provide a fallback to reload a

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:49.026 A:middle
resource from your server, in

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:50.676 A:middle
case the third-party script

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:51.896 A:middle
fails to execute.

00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:55.516 A:middle
Now, keeping compromised

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:57.636 A:middle
resources from executing keeps

00:08:57.816 --> 00:08:58.706 A:middle
users secure.

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:00.336 A:middle
And, intelligent tracking
