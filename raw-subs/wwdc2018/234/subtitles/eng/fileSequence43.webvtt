Switch back to the iPad, and

00:43:03.076 --> 00:43:04.726 A:middle
there's our finished product.

00:43:04.766 --> 00:43:06.656 A:middle
That looks pretty nice, but now

00:43:06.656 --> 00:43:08.166 A:middle
my users can also tap on this

00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:09.936 A:middle
Quick Look, AR Quick Look icon

00:43:09.936 --> 00:43:10.926 A:middle
in the corner here.

00:43:11.296 --> 00:43:15.136 A:middle
We can see the model, move it

00:43:15.136 --> 00:43:18.726 A:middle
around, and I can also place it

00:43:18.726 --> 00:43:20.586 A:middle
in the real world, and actually

00:43:20.586 --> 00:43:22.296 A:middle
get a sense of what I'm going to

00:43:22.756 --> 00:43:22.886 A:middle
build.

00:43:30.336 --> 00:43:33.576 A:middle
So, it's actually really easy to

00:43:34.356 --> 00:43:34.806 A:middle
do this.

00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:36.416 A:middle
Please check out that session if

00:43:36.416 --> 00:43:37.226 A:middle
you have the chance.

00:43:37.386 --> 00:43:38.796 A:middle
I'd like to bring Shloka back up

00:43:38.796 --> 00:43:39.776 A:middle
on stage to wrap things up.

00:43:39.776 --> 00:43:39.956 A:middle
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Jason.

00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:51.716 A:middle
And, the AR model looks really,

00:43:51.716 --> 00:43:52.416 A:middle
really cool.

00:43:52.656 --> 00:43:54.536 A:middle
And, I think its inspired me to

00:43:55.626 --> 00:43:57.896 A:middle
try to build a birdhouse.

00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:00.186 A:middle
Not making any promises.
