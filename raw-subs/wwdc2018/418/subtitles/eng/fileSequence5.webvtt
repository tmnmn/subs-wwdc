00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.236 A:middle
selected, enter a message to

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:03.346 A:middle
record the reason for your

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:03.916 A:middle
changes.

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:05.906 A:middle
This message makes it easy to

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:07.126 A:middle
understand the reason for the

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:08.906 A:middle
changes later when going back to

00:05:08.906 --> 00:05:09.506 A:middle
review them.

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.236 A:middle
Now that we've made a couple

00:05:13.236 --> 00:05:15.486 A:middle
commits, let's talk about

00:05:15.486 --> 00:05:16.116 A:middle
viewing them.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:18.336 A:middle
You may want to refer back to

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.116 A:middle
them to better understand how

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:21.566 A:middle
your code and project have

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:22.626 A:middle
changed over time.

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:24.216 A:middle
This can be useful for

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:25.606 A:middle
discovering the timeline of when

00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:26.656 A:middle
code was introduced in your

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:28.486 A:middle
project, and why specific

00:05:28.486 --> 00:05:29.306 A:middle
changes were made.

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:31.616 A:middle
Xcode offers several ways to

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:32.416 A:middle
view this history.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.736 A:middle
First is the comparison mode,

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:38.066 A:middle
which we just saw a little bit

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:38.856 A:middle
in the commit sheet.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.386 A:middle
Xcode lets you view every file

00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:42.626 A:middle
in your project as it has

00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:43.846 A:middle
changed through time in this

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:44.286 A:middle
way.

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:47.206 A:middle
To access it, use the Version

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:48.706 A:middle
Editor mode from the toolbar,

00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:49.816 A:middle
seen here.

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:54.056 A:middle
Clicking and holding the

00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.896 A:middle
selector will let you jump to a

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:57.516 A:middle
specific mode of the version

00:05:57.516 --> 00:05:57.866 A:middle
editor.
