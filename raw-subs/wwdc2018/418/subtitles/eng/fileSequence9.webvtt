00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.596 A:middle
In these cases, the features are

00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:01.866 A:middle
limited to standard Git

00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:04.086 A:middle
operations such as push and

00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:04.356 A:middle
pull.

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:06.356 A:middle
And there is no account to sign

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:06.696 A:middle
into.

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:09.066 A:middle
You just authenticate on demand

00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:09.586 A:middle
as needed.

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:13.456 A:middle
Xcode also supports many common

00:09:13.456 --> 00:09:15.416 A:middle
hosting solutions such as

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:17.896 A:middle
GitHub, BitBucket, and

00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:19.026 A:middle
GitLab.com.

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:21.696 A:middle
With these services, additional

00:09:21.696 --> 00:09:23.836 A:middle
features are supported, such as

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:25.086 A:middle
searching for repositories to

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:26.726 A:middle
clone and creating new

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:28.066 A:middle
repositories on the server

00:09:28.406 --> 00:09:29.456 A:middle
directly from Xcode.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.856 A:middle
In addition to the cloud

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:33.076 A:middle
versions of these services,

00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:34.986 A:middle
self-hosted and enterprise

00:09:34.986 --> 00:09:36.776 A:middle
versions used on premise by

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.946 A:middle
larger teams are also supported

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:39.546 A:middle
in Xcode.

00:09:42.096 --> 00:09:43.486 A:middle
So let's take a look at adding

00:09:43.486 --> 00:09:44.706 A:middle
one of these hosted accounts.

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.816 A:middle
You can add this account type

00:09:47.976 --> 00:09:50.326 A:middle
from Xcode's preferences under

00:09:50.326 --> 00:09:51.696 A:middle
the Account Preference pane.

00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:55.636 A:middle
You just sign into the account

00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:57.476 A:middle
using your username and

00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:59.336 A:middle
password, just like you would on

00:09:59.336 --> 00:09:59.866 A:middle
the website.
