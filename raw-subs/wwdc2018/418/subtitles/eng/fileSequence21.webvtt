00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:01.346 A:middle
viewing changes in your project.

00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:03.996 A:middle
We also saw how repositories can

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.226 A:middle
be hosted and changes

00:21:05.226 --> 00:21:06.266 A:middle
synchronized when working with

00:21:06.336 --> 00:21:06.836 A:middle
teams.

00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:08.816 A:middle
And when syncing those changes,

00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:10.966 A:middle
how you resolve and even avoid

00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:11.656 A:middle
conflicts.

00:21:12.246 --> 00:21:13.956 A:middle
And last, we took a brief look

00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:15.166 A:middle
at some additional hosting

00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.176 A:middle
features like pull requests and

00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:17.656 A:middle
forks.

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:20.646 A:middle
More information for this

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:21.676 A:middle
session is available at

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:23.106 A:middle

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:25.366 A:middle
