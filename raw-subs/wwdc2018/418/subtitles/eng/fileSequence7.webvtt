00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:01.876 A:middle
The source control log looks at

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:04.066 A:middle
a file's entire history so you

00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:06.326 A:middle
can see who made changes and why

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:08.036 A:middle
over the entire history of the

00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:08.396 A:middle
file.

00:07:10.026 --> 00:07:11.426 A:middle
Now, sometimes you want a way to

00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:12.806 A:middle
see changes made using source

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:14.506 A:middle
control across not just a single

00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:16.836 A:middle
file, but your entire project.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:18.896 A:middle
To see this, you can select the

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.956 A:middle
Source Control Navigator as the

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:23.376 A:middle
second navigator in Xcode.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.626 A:middle
The Source Control Navigator

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:30.726 A:middle
provides a view of your whole

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:32.466 A:middle
repository by listing branches

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:33.166 A:middle
and tags.

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.656 A:middle
Branches are the individual

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:37.136 A:middle
streams of history that make up

00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:38.616 A:middle
your project, such as the

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:39.796 A:middle
current in development work.

00:07:40.796 --> 00:07:42.026 A:middle
When you start a new project,

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
you'll have just one branch,

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:45.306 A:middle
typically named Master.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:47.876 A:middle
Selecting it will show the

00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:49.336 A:middle
history of that branch, which

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:50.226 A:middle
can be seen here.

00:07:51.786 --> 00:07:53.676 A:middle
In this history view, you can

00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:54.956 A:middle
see the history is marked with

00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:56.616 A:middle
tags shown in purple.

00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:58.566 A:middle
Tags are bookmarks of

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:00.606 A:middle
particularly important points in
