If you're signing into a

00:10:01.336 --> 00:10:03.666 A:middle
self-hosted version, you'll also

00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:05.256 A:middle
get a chance to provide the URL

00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:06.506 A:middle
for the specific server that you

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:09.806 A:middle
want to connect to.

00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:11.486 A:middle
Now that Xcode is signed into a

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.126 A:middle
hosted source control account,

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:15.026 A:middle
we can start sending our changes

00:10:15.026 --> 00:10:16.686 A:middle
up to the server and getting

00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:19.426 A:middle
other changes from it.

00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:20.956 A:middle
But before we start pushing and

00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:23.456 A:middle
pulling code in Xcode, let's

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.006 A:middle
take a brief moment to discuss

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:26.956 A:middle
how Git and these hosting

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:28.716 A:middle
solutions handle security.

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:34.106 A:middle
Git supports two main methods

00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:35.266 A:middle
for securing changes when

00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:36.456 A:middle
connecting to a server.

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:40.546 A:middle
The first, HTTPS, is the same

00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:42.226 A:middle
way most websites are secured.

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:44.726 A:middle
It trusts the server based on a

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:46.986 A:middle
certificate and uses a username

00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:48.536 A:middle
and password to authenticate you

00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:49.046 A:middle
as a user.

00:10:50.626 --> 00:10:53.676 A:middle
The other method, SSH, works a

00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:55.396 A:middle
bit differently, particularly

00:10:55.396 --> 00:10:56.846 A:middle
with these hosted solutions.

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:00.236 A:middle
In general, SSH connections for
