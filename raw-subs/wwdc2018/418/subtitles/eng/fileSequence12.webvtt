00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
the public portion of the key

00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:01.956 A:middle
directly to the hosting site.

00:12:03.116 --> 00:12:04.766 A:middle
With the public key upload

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.246 A:middle
complete, Xcode can transmit Git

00:12:07.246 --> 00:12:09.636 A:middle
data securely to the server over

00:12:09.636 --> 00:12:11.776 A:middle
the SSH protocol in addition to

00:12:11.776 --> 00:12:12.736 A:middle
HTTPS.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.586 A:middle
That also means we can now

00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:16.076 A:middle
create new repositories on the

00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:18.176 A:middle
server and clone existing ones.

00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:19.796 A:middle
So let's take a quick look at

00:12:19.796 --> 00:12:20.016 A:middle
that.

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:23.596 A:middle
If we go back to our local only

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:26.046 A:middle
repository, we can now create a

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.076 A:middle
new remote for it.

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:29.316 A:middle
This is a full copy of that

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.456 A:middle
repository up on the hosted

00:12:31.456 --> 00:12:31.896 A:middle
site.

00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:34.236 A:middle
We can do this from the Source

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:36.356 A:middle
Control Navigator in the Context

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:38.506 A:middle
menu by selecting Create New

00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:38.936 A:middle
Remote.

00:12:41.216 --> 00:12:42.516 A:middle
We then have a few options

00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:43.936 A:middle
depending on the hosting site.

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:45.626 A:middle
And we can choose to make it

00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:48.086 A:middle
either public or private, based

00:12:48.086 --> 00:12:49.426 A:middle
on our exact needs for this

00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:50.036 A:middle
project.

00:12:51.156 --> 00:12:52.246 A:middle
It can then be shared with other

00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:54.016 A:middle
developers or synched across

00:12:54.016 --> 00:12:54.606 A:middle
machines.

00:12:55.406 --> 00:12:56.766 A:middle
And when you want to download a

00:12:56.766 --> 00:12:57.946 A:middle
project that has already been

00:12:57.946 --> 00:12:59.896 A:middle
hosted on a server, such as on a

00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:01.406 A:middle
new machine or when joining a
