00:17:01.526 --> 00:17:02.806 A:middle
Now, with all the conflicts

00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:04.516 A:middle
resolved, the pull can continue.

00:17:05.705 --> 00:17:06.935 A:middle
If this were a merge pull,

00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:08.626 A:middle
conflicts are all resolved at

00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:09.866 A:middle
once and the resolution is

00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:11.256 A:middle
stored in the merge commit.

00:17:12.796 --> 00:17:14.556 A:middle
If we were doing a pull rebase,

00:17:14.896 --> 00:17:15.955 A:middle
it is possible to have to

00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:17.425 A:middle
resolve a set of conflicts

00:17:17.756 --> 00:17:19.226 A:middle
multiple times as each

00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:21.146 A:middle
individual commit is replayed on

00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:23.056 A:middle
top of your coworker's changes.

00:17:23.906 --> 00:17:25.086 A:middle
The resolution information in

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.296 A:middle
this case is stored on the

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.576 A:middle
original commit as if it never

00:17:29.576 --> 00:17:29.976 A:middle
occurred.

00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:32.656 A:middle
Now, because conflicts can be a

00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:34.316 A:middle
bit annoying to resolve, it can

00:17:34.316 --> 00:17:36.206 A:middle
be very useful to anticipate

00:17:36.206 --> 00:17:37.956 A:middle
conflicts and avoid having them

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.156 A:middle
happen in the first place.

00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:41.566 A:middle
In Xcode Source Control

00:17:41.566 --> 00:17:43.746 A:middle
Preferences, the Change bar can

00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:45.166 A:middle
optionally be shown to show

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.416 A:middle
coworker's changes as they push

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:47.636 A:middle
them.

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:52.806 A:middle
This makes it easy to tell what

00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:54.406 A:middle
part of a file is out of date.

00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:56.226 A:middle
The changes are fetched from the

00:17:56.226 --> 00:17:57.886 A:middle
server at a 10-minute interval.
