00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
project.

00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:03.666 A:middle
Just like when pulling, the work

00:19:03.666 --> 00:19:04.976 A:middle
done on a branch will diverge

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.306 A:middle
from the main branch of code.

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:08.116 A:middle
So a merge will be necessary to

00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:10.196 A:middle
resolve any conflicts and

00:19:10.196 --> 00:19:11.186 A:middle
reintegrate the work.

00:19:12.356 --> 00:19:13.956 A:middle
A pull request, shown here in

00:19:13.956 --> 00:19:16.236 A:middle
yellow, is a way to see what

00:19:16.236 --> 00:19:18.336 A:middle
will be merged and allow the

00:19:18.336 --> 00:19:20.126 A:middle
commenting on that work by other

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:20.756 A:middle
individuals.

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:22.456 A:middle
Often this will mean making

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:24.136 A:middle
additional changes on the branch

00:19:24.476 --> 00:19:25.776 A:middle
before merging and integrating

00:19:25.776 --> 00:19:25.916 A:middle
it.

00:19:27.046 --> 00:19:28.476 A:middle
Since pull requests are built on

00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:30.246 A:middle
Git's branching model, you can

00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:31.836 A:middle
always locally check out that

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:33.326 A:middle
branch from the source control

00:19:33.326 --> 00:19:35.196 A:middle
navigator in Xcode when

00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:35.766 A:middle
reviewing it.

00:19:36.746 --> 00:19:38.036 A:middle
This lets you build and test the

00:19:38.036 --> 00:19:39.426 A:middle
work on your local machine

00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:42.016 A:middle
before approving it and merging

00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.346 A:middle
it back into the main branch.

00:19:44.756 --> 00:19:46.316 A:middle
Forks take advantage of the

00:19:46.316 --> 00:19:48.076 A:middle
distributed nature of Git.

00:19:49.296 --> 00:19:50.646 A:middle
Just like how the server copy of

00:19:50.646 --> 00:19:52.386 A:middle
the repository and the local

00:19:52.386 --> 00:19:54.356 A:middle
copy on your machine are two

00:19:54.356 --> 00:19:55.996 A:middle
copies of the same repository,

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.466 A:middle
you can create multiple copies

00:19:58.466 --> 00:20:00.006 A:middle
of a repository on the same
