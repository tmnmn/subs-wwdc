00:18:00.036 --> 00:18:02.396 A:middle
Here we see the Change bar that

00:18:02.396 --> 00:18:04.726 A:middle
we saw before, when upstream

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:07.366 A:middle
changes are showing, turns to

00:18:07.366 --> 00:18:09.256 A:middle
red to indicate where our

00:18:09.436 --> 00:18:10.436 A:middle
coworkers have been making

00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:10.956 A:middle
changes.

00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.536 A:middle
This indicates a conflict will

00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:14.976 A:middle
have to be resolved to

00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:16.446 A:middle
reintegrate the local changes.

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:18.706 A:middle
In many cases it can be easier

00:18:18.706 --> 00:18:20.446 A:middle
to pull before making changes to

00:18:20.446 --> 00:18:22.356 A:middle
a file that already has changes

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:22.956 A:middle
upstream.

00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:25.926 A:middle
Some details about the

00:18:25.926 --> 00:18:27.786 A:middle
conflicting commit can be seen

00:18:27.826 --> 00:18:29.076 A:middle
by clicking on the Change bar.

00:18:32.416 --> 00:18:33.726 A:middle
All of the hosting solutions

00:18:33.796 --> 00:18:35.676 A:middle
supported in Xcode also support

00:18:35.776 --> 00:18:37.926 A:middle
two other common workflows, pull

00:18:37.926 --> 00:18:39.376 A:middle
requests and forks.

00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:41.686 A:middle
These are based on Git concepts

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:43.546 A:middle
and features, but are distinct

00:18:43.586 --> 00:18:44.616 A:middle
from Git's feature set.

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.556 A:middle
Pull requests are a method for

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:48.586 A:middle
doing code reviews.

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:51.306 A:middle
It is usually best practice to

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:52.596 A:middle
do all disruptive work to a

00:18:52.596 --> 00:18:54.166 A:middle
project on a branch.

00:18:54.616 --> 00:18:55.996 A:middle
This is an isolated line of

00:18:55.996 --> 00:18:58.256 A:middle
commit history that is separate

00:18:58.386 --> 00:18:59.576 A:middle
from the other history of a

00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
project.
