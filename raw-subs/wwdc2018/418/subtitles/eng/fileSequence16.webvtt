00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:00.266 A:middle
pulled.

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:03.436 A:middle
This can make looking back at

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.536 A:middle
history much more simple, as

00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:07.266 A:middle
there is no merge commit or

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:08.726 A:middle
divergence in history.

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:12.666 A:middle
Sometimes when pulling, you will

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:14.586 A:middle
have made local commits that

00:16:14.586 --> 00:16:16.326 A:middle
change something in the same

00:16:16.326 --> 00:16:17.726 A:middle
place as someone else is making

00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:18.176 A:middle
changes.

00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:20.176 A:middle
This can cause what is known in

00:16:20.176 --> 00:16:22.336 A:middle
Git as a conflict, where it is

00:16:22.336 --> 00:16:24.266 A:middle
unclear how to have both changes

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:25.006 A:middle
coexist.

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:29.856 A:middle
Xcode allows you to resolve

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:31.086 A:middle
conflicts when pulling or

00:16:31.086 --> 00:16:32.026 A:middle
merging a branch.

00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:34.196 A:middle
Xcode will present a sheet

00:16:34.196 --> 00:16:35.976 A:middle
similar to the commit sheet with

00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:38.466 A:middle
options to take your change, or

00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:39.226 A:middle
the other change.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:41.716 A:middle
It is also possible to manually

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:43.786 A:middle
edit the file, or take both

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:45.406 A:middle
changes if there are better ways

00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:46.236 A:middle
to combine the work.

00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:50.376 A:middle
In this case, we see that two

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
users have both made changes on

00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:52.786 A:middle
the same line.

00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:55.106 A:middle
It seems that the local changes

00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:56.936 A:middle
are a bit more up to date, so

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:58.406 A:middle
the easiest way to resolve this

00:16:58.486 --> 00:16:59.776 A:middle
is to take the left changes.
