is Unavailable.

00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:03.086 A:middle
Now that you have all this

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:03.996 A:middle
information you're ready to

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.026 A:middle
build some awesome shortcuts

00:21:05.026 --> 00:21:05.976 A:middle
from both the watch and the

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:06.276 A:middle
phone.

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:07.516 A:middle
So, I'd like to hand things over

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.766 A:middle
to Josh to talk a little bit

00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:09.476 A:middle
more about our prediction

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:09.766 A:middle
engine.

00:21:09.766 --> 00:21:09.966 A:middle
Thank you.

00:21:10.516 --> 00:21:17.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:18.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paul.

00:21:19.686 --> 00:21:20.166 A:middle
Good morning.

00:21:20.686 --> 00:21:22.176 A:middle
My name is Josh, and I am an

00:21:22.176 --> 00:21:23.516 A:middle
engineer on the watchOS team.

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:25.236 A:middle
And, we're really excited to see

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:26.536 A:middle
the kinds of relevant shortcuts

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.156 A:middle
that you can surface on the Siri

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:28.766 A:middle
watch face.

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:31.186 A:middle
So, Paul just walked you through

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:32.616 A:middle
some of the API's and different

00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:34.456 A:middle
ways that you can provide your

00:21:34.456 --> 00:21:35.416 A:middle
relevant shortcuts to the

00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:35.866 A:middle
system.

00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:37.916 A:middle
Now, I want to talk about how

00:21:37.916 --> 00:21:38.926 A:middle
the system predicts your

00:21:38.926 --> 00:21:40.336 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and the

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:42.166 A:middle
things that you can do to ensure

00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:43.946 A:middle
the system surfaces your content

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:45.046 A:middle
when it's most appropriate to

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:45.426 A:middle
the user.

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:49.136 A:middle
It's like Paul talked about

00:21:49.136 --> 00:21:50.946 A:middle
earlier, content on the Siri

00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:52.116 A:middle
watch face is ordered by

00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:53.316 A:middle
relevance to the user.

00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.586 A:middle
At a wrist raise, we want to be

00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:57.196 A:middle
surfacing the content the user

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.366 A:middle
cares about most.

00:21:58.666 --> 00:21:59.506 A:middle
Whether that be based on the

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
current time, location, or other
