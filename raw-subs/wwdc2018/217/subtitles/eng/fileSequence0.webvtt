&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:29.246 A:middle
My name's Paul Salzman, and my

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:30.636 A:middle
friend Josh Ford and I are very

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
excited to talk to you today

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:33.066 A:middle
about servicing your Siri

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.276 A:middle
shortcuts on the Siri watch

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:34.626 A:middle
face.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:37.556 A:middle
Last year, we released the Siri

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.276 A:middle
watch face, which has glanceable

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:40.486 A:middle
information and tappable

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:41.686 A:middle
actions, sorted by their

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.056 A:middle
relevance to the user, at every

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:43.516 A:middle
wrist raise.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.786 A:middle
That means our users have access

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:47.326 A:middle
to dynamically updated content,

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:48.646 A:middle
relevant to them throughout the

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:50.006 A:middle
day without any configuration

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:50.436 A:middle
required.

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:53.046 A:middle
And now, in watchOS 5, we are

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.466 A:middle
very excited to add your

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.936 A:middle
applications as data sources to

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:56.766 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.666 A:middle
The shortcuts you provide will

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
show up on the watch face, on
