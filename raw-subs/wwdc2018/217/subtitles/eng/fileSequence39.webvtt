00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:02.216 A:middle
they might be interested in.

00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:03.456 A:middle
We also have an evening

00:39:03.456 --> 00:39:04.136 A:middle
situation.

00:39:04.706 --> 00:39:05.726 A:middle
And so, this allows us to

00:39:05.726 --> 00:39:07.136 A:middle
surface content before the user

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:07.706 A:middle
goes to bed.

00:39:08.586 --> 00:39:10.386 A:middle
So, we use this one for the new

00:39:10.726 --> 00:39:12.956 A:middle
heart rate card in watchOS 5, so

00:39:12.956 --> 00:39:14.046 A:middle
that we can provide the user a

00:39:14.046 --> 00:39:15.246 A:middle
summary of their heart rate

00:39:15.246 --> 00:39:18.296 A:middle
activity throughout the day.

00:39:18.446 --> 00:39:19.046 A:middle
And, creating a

00:39:19.046 --> 00:39:20.406 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider is

00:39:20.406 --> 00:39:20.956 A:middle
really easy.

00:39:20.956 --> 00:39:22.436 A:middle
You've just got to specify which

00:39:22.436 --> 00:39:23.566 A:middle
situation you're interested in.

00:39:23.566 --> 00:39:25.296 A:middle
So, in this case, we can really

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.306 A:middle
easily create a

00:39:26.306 --> 00:39:27.676 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider to

00:39:27.676 --> 00:39:28.796 A:middle
surface content right when the

00:39:28.796 --> 00:39:31.286 A:middle
user wakes up.

00:39:32.206 --> 00:39:33.566 A:middle
And, the behavior for both these

00:39:33.566 --> 00:39:35.226 A:middle
two situations is very similar

00:39:35.226 --> 00:39:36.936 A:middle
to a dateLocation-- or a

00:39:36.936 --> 00:39:37.876 A:middle
dateRelevanceProvider.

00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:39.936 A:middle
Except that the system is

00:39:39.936 --> 00:39:41.706 A:middle
automatically figuring out what

00:39:41.706 --> 00:39:42.616 A:middle
are the dates that we should be

00:39:42.616 --> 00:39:43.606 A:middle
surfacing this content.

00:39:46.526 --> 00:39:47.816 A:middle
We also have a few situations

00:39:47.816 --> 00:39:49.236 A:middle
available to you that allow you

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:50.536 A:middle
to surface content in meaningful

00:39:50.536 --> 00:39:52.186 A:middle
locations to the user, whether

00:39:52.186 --> 00:39:57.086 A:middle
that be home, work, school, or

00:39:57.086 --> 00:39:57.986 A:middle
when the user arrives to the

00:39:57.986 --> 00:39:58.256 A:middle
gym.
