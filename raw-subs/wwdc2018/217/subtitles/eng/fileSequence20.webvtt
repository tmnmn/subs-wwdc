00:19:59.826 --> 00:20:01.956 A:middle
handle your shortcut, except on

00:20:01.956 --> 00:20:03.316 A:middle
iOS, we'll execute it back on

00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:04.366 A:middle
the phone, even if your phone

00:20:04.366 --> 00:20:05.786 A:middle
isn't near the user.

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:08.556 A:middle
Now, because we can be executing

00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:09.846 A:middle
content back on the phone, we

00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:10.766 A:middle
want to make sure that users

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:12.116 A:middle
don't tap on a platter, and then

00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:13.266 A:middle
are immediately told to go find

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:13.676 A:middle
their phone.

00:20:13.676 --> 00:20:15.286 A:middle
So, we have a couple of rules

00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:16.536 A:middle
about the type of shortcuts that

00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:17.536 A:middle
will execute back on the phone

00:20:17.536 --> 00:20:18.516 A:middle
that we're willing to surface.

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:21.126 A:middle
Requirements are that they're

00:20:21.126 --> 00:20:21.756 A:middle
intent-based.

00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:23.166 A:middle
They handle background

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:23.796 A:middle
execution.

00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:25.316 A:middle
And, they don't require access

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:26.076 A:middle
to protected data.

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:27.266 A:middle
And, that's the data that you

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:28.826 A:middle
keep encrypted when the phone is

00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:29.116 A:middle
locked.

00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:31.496 A:middle
The way you can ensure that your

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.316 A:middle
content meets these requirements

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.256 A:middle
is by taking a look at the

00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:35.276 A:middle
parameter combination in your

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.916 A:middle
custom intent, and ensuring that

00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:38.126 A:middle
background execution is

00:20:38.126 --> 00:20:38.576 A:middle
supported.

00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:40.796 A:middle
And, looking at your overall

00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:42.246 A:middle
custom intent and seeing if you

00:20:42.246 --> 00:20:43.576 A:middle
have any authentication

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:44.466 A:middle
restrictions you've applied.

00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:46.306 A:middle
There are three options here,

00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:47.336 A:middle
and we support the first two.

00:20:47.786 --> 00:20:48.636 A:middle
The first one is that there are

00:20:48.636 --> 00:20:49.316 A:middle
no restrictions.

00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:51.626 A:middle
The second one says that you are

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:52.786 A:middle
restricted while the device is

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:53.926 A:middle
locked, which means that at

00:20:53.926 --> 00:20:54.886 A:middle
least the watch has to be

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:55.956 A:middle
unlocked for us to execute.

00:20:56.306 --> 00:20:58.276 A:middle
And the final one is Restricted

00:20:58.276 --> 00:20:59.826 A:middle
While Locked, or Protected Data

00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:00.486 A:middle
is Unavailable.
