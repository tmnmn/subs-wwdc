00:43:00.126 --> 00:43:01.316 A:middle
the most interesting content to

00:43:01.316 --> 00:43:02.636 A:middle
the user right on a wrist raise.

00:43:04.966 --> 00:43:07.126 A:middle
And finally, if the information

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:08.246 A:middle
that you're trying to surface is

00:43:08.246 --> 00:43:10.606 A:middle
timely, indicate that to us

00:43:10.776 --> 00:43:12.086 A:middle
through the relevance providers,

00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:13.846 A:middle
so the system can surface your

00:43:13.846 --> 00:43:15.126 A:middle
content, again, when it's most

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:15.596 A:middle
appropriate.

00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:19.856 A:middle
And so, that is glanceable

00:43:19.856 --> 00:43:20.426 A:middle
information.

00:43:20.846 --> 00:43:21.716 A:middle
Now, let's talk a little bit

00:43:21.716 --> 00:43:23.136 A:middle
about tappable actions on the

00:43:23.136 --> 00:43:23.936 A:middle
Siri watch face.

00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:27.326 A:middle
So, you can see we have this

00:43:27.356 --> 00:43:28.356 A:middle
fitness trainer app again.

00:43:28.676 --> 00:43:30.006 A:middle
And, I can really easily, right

00:43:30.006 --> 00:43:31.426 A:middle
on my wrist, get this reminder

00:43:31.426 --> 00:43:32.266 A:middle
that I need to go out for my

00:43:32.266 --> 00:43:32.586 A:middle
run.

00:43:34.656 --> 00:43:36.156 A:middle
And tapping on it, I get this

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:37.636 A:middle
nice confirmation to make sure

00:43:37.636 --> 00:43:39.026 A:middle
that this is the actual action

00:43:39.026 --> 00:43:39.886 A:middle
that I want to execute.

00:43:41.226 --> 00:43:42.816 A:middle
And, in two taps, I can start

00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:43.376 A:middle
this workout.

00:43:43.576 --> 00:43:44.676 A:middle
I don't need to spend time

00:43:44.676 --> 00:43:46.426 A:middle
digging through apps to find

00:43:46.426 --> 00:43:47.736 A:middle
this particular fitness trainer

00:43:47.736 --> 00:43:49.326 A:middle
app, and start-- kick off my

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:49.776 A:middle
workout.

00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:51.346 A:middle
I can really easily in two taps,

00:43:51.346 --> 00:43:53.126 A:middle
right from my watch face, kick

00:43:53.126 --> 00:43:54.196 A:middle
off this workout.

00:43:57.256 --> 00:43:58.706 A:middle
So, if you're providing tappable

00:43:58.706 --> 00:43:59.936 A:middle
actions, a few things to keep in

00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:00.246 A:middle
mind.
