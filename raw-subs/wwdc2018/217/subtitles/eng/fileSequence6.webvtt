00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
And, the watch will examine it.

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.646 A:middle
And, in this case, it'll

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:02.626 A:middle
determine that there isn't an

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:03.766 A:middle
application that's installed

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:04.916 A:middle
that can handle the shortcut.

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.556 A:middle
So, we'll check with the phone

00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:07.816 A:middle
and see if it has an app that

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:08.576 A:middle
can handle the shortcut.

00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:10.316 A:middle
And, in this case, yes there is.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:11.306 A:middle
So, we're going to forward that

00:06:11.306 --> 00:06:12.496 A:middle
request over to the phone.

00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:14.216 A:middle
And, the proper application, or

00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:15.486 A:middle
intents extension will handle

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:16.016 A:middle
execution.

00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:18.536 A:middle
When execution is complete, a

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:19.676 A:middle
result will be generated on the

00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:21.156 A:middle
phone, and forward back to the

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:22.336 A:middle
watch, and conveyed to the user.

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.806 A:middle
So, now that we understand the

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:26.946 A:middle
key concepts that make up a

00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:28.256 A:middle
shortcut, and how it'll execute

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.446 A:middle
on the watch, let's talk about

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:31.166 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, which take

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.456 A:middle
your shortcuts and show them on

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.376 A:middle
the watch face when they're most

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:33.696 A:middle
relevant.

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:36.466 A:middle
We can automatically populate

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:37.756 A:middle
the fields on the platters on

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:38.936 A:middle
the Siri watch face, based on

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:39.846 A:middle
your shortcut content.

00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:41.706 A:middle
But, you can also customize the

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:42.826 A:middle
platter's display, which is

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:43.846 A:middle
really useful for displaying

00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:44.816 A:middle
glanceable information.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:47.756 A:middle
And, of course when your platter

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:48.666 A:middle
is tapped, the underlying

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:49.706 A:middle
shortcut will be executed.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:51.106 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how

00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:52.186 A:middle
this will run on this watch

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:52.476 A:middle
face.

00:06:53.006 --> 00:06:54.976 A:middle
If your shortcut is backed by a

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.226 A:middle
user activity, when the user

00:06:56.226 --> 00:06:57.916 A:middle
taps on it, your app will be

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.136 A:middle
launched into the appropriate
