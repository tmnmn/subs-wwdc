00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:01.016 A:middle
context to the system, whether

00:32:01.016 --> 00:32:02.286 A:middle
that be a concrete time,

00:32:02.286 --> 00:32:03.796 A:middle
location, or other information,

00:32:04.516 --> 00:32:06.316 A:middle
you can provide that through the

00:32:06.316 --> 00:32:07.346 A:middle
relevanceProvider API.

00:32:07.346 --> 00:32:08.926 A:middle
And so, this allows you to

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.736 A:middle
indicate hints to the system at

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:12.086 A:middle
when your content is most

00:32:12.086 --> 00:32:13.226 A:middle
important to your users.

00:32:15.896 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
It also allows you to surface

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:18.586 A:middle
new content that users may not

00:32:18.586 --> 00:32:19.296 A:middle
have seen before.

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:21.306 A:middle
Since you're providing this

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.646 A:middle
additional hints to the system,

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:24.556 A:middle
we don't need to have seen as

00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:26.166 A:middle
much of the user's past behavior

00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:27.616 A:middle
and consistency before the

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:28.986 A:middle
system becomes confident that

00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:30.216 A:middle
this is something the user cares

00:32:30.216 --> 00:32:30.466 A:middle
about.

00:32:33.056 --> 00:32:34.826 A:middle
But, it's also important to keep

00:32:34.826 --> 00:32:36.816 A:middle
in mind that user engagement is

00:32:36.816 --> 00:32:38.496 A:middle
taken into account at every step

00:32:38.496 --> 00:32:39.256 A:middle
of the process.

00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:40.626 A:middle
If you provide relevance

00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:42.026 A:middle
providers or not, we want to

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.036 A:middle
make sure that the content that

00:32:43.036 --> 00:32:44.416 A:middle
we're surfacing is stuff that

00:32:44.416 --> 00:32:44.976 A:middle
the user cares about.

00:32:49.156 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
So, let's take another look at

00:32:51.266 --> 00:32:52.016 A:middle
this recipes app.

00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:53.376 A:middle
So, like what we talked about

00:32:53.376 --> 00:32:54.926 A:middle
earlier, there's not really a

00:32:54.926 --> 00:32:56.626 A:middle
concrete time or location

00:32:56.626 --> 00:32:58.536 A:middle
associated with it, right?

00:32:58.536 --> 00:32:59.676 A:middle
The time that I want to interact

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.346 A:middle
with this app may be for cooking
