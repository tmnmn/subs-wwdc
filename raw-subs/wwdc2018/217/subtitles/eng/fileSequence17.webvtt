00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:00.506 A:middle
instances where our application

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:02.106 A:middle
will get a callback directly.

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:03.646 A:middle
The first one being if there's

00:17:03.646 --> 00:17:04.856 A:middle
an error during execution, and

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:05.776 A:middle
we say we need to handle this

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:06.846 A:middle
within our app.

00:17:07.116 --> 00:17:08.165 A:middle
The other one, though, might

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:09.096 A:middle
happen if the user wants to

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:09.856 A:middle
tweak a couple of the

00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:10.415 A:middle
parameters.

00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:11.836 A:middle
For instance, they see that

00:17:11.836 --> 00:17:12.806 A:middle
they're about to log a cookie,

00:17:13.076 --> 00:17:13.866 A:middle
when they really know they just

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.356 A:middle
ate 5.

00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:16.195 A:middle
So, we'll tap on the top module,

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
we'll launch into your

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:18.276 A:middle
application, and you'll get a

00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:18.945 A:middle
callback here.

00:17:19.396 --> 00:17:20.945 A:middle
The userActivity you'll receive

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.586 A:middle
will have an activity type equal

00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:23.945 A:middle
to the name of the class of

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:24.846 A:middle
intent you gave us.

00:17:25.386 --> 00:17:27.626 A:middle
At this point, you can extract

00:17:27.626 --> 00:17:28.526 A:middle
an interaction off of

00:17:28.526 --> 00:17:30.546 A:middle
userActivity, and an intent off

00:17:30.546 --> 00:17:31.936 A:middle
of that interaction, which will

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:33.176 A:middle
have all the parameters you set

00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:33.826 A:middle
when you created your

00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:35.086 A:middle
relevantShortcut.

00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:37.366 A:middle
So, now we're ready to create

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:38.506 A:middle
relevant shortcuts whenever our

00:17:38.506 --> 00:17:39.596 A:middle
application has runtime.

00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:40.966 A:middle
But, it's very important to

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:42.136 A:middle
note, that just because your

00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:43.166 A:middle
content is showing up on the

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:44.456 A:middle
Siri watch face, doesn't mean

00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:45.676 A:middle
your application is actively

00:17:45.676 --> 00:17:45.966 A:middle
running.

00:17:46.496 --> 00:17:48.006 A:middle
So, to help you get more runtime

00:17:48.176 --> 00:17:49.256 A:middle
to provide relative shortcuts,

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:50.186 A:middle
we've created the

00:17:50.186 --> 00:17:52.676 A:middle
WKRelevantShortcutRefresh

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:53.336 A:middle
BackgroundTask.

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.026 A:middle
We'll be handing this out to

00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:57.516 A:middle
applications that are providing

00:17:57.596 --> 00:17:58.916 A:middle
awesome relevant shortcuts that

00:17:58.916 --> 00:17:59.896 A:middle
our users are spending time

00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:02.116 A:middle
looking at, tapping through, but
