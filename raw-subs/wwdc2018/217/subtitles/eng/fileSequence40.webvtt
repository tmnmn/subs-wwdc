00:40:00.046 --> 00:40:01.056 A:middle
And again, creating one of these

00:40:01.056 --> 00:40:02.436 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProviders

00:40:02.436 --> 00:40:03.206 A:middle
is really easy.

00:40:03.266 --> 00:40:04.426 A:middle
You just need to specify which

00:40:04.426 --> 00:40:05.556 A:middle
situation you're interested in.

00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:09.646 A:middle
And, for all of these

00:40:09.646 --> 00:40:11.136 A:middle
situations, the behavior of this

00:40:11.136 --> 00:40:12.826 A:middle
relevanceProvider is similar

00:40:12.826 --> 00:40:13.356 A:middle
again to a

00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:14.636 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider,

00:40:14.936 --> 00:40:15.866 A:middle
except that the system is

00:40:15.866 --> 00:40:17.176 A:middle
automatically figuring out the

00:40:17.176 --> 00:40:18.186 A:middle
locations on your behalf.

00:40:19.296 --> 00:40:20.346 A:middle
And so, as the user gets closer

00:40:20.346 --> 00:40:22.046 A:middle
to these locations, your content

00:40:22.046 --> 00:40:23.616 A:middle
will become more relevant to

00:40:23.746 --> 00:40:24.436 A:middle
your users.

00:40:26.086 --> 00:40:28.626 A:middle
So, that is some of the insight

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.006 A:middle
into how we predict your

00:40:30.006 --> 00:40:31.066 A:middle
relevant shortcuts on the Siri

00:40:31.066 --> 00:40:31.656 A:middle
watch face.

00:40:31.906 --> 00:40:33.016 A:middle
And, some of the things that you

00:40:33.016 --> 00:40:34.606 A:middle
can do to provide additional

00:40:34.606 --> 00:40:36.446 A:middle
context to the system so that we

00:40:36.446 --> 00:40:37.836 A:middle
can surface your content when

00:40:37.836 --> 00:40:38.666 A:middle
it's most appropriate.

00:40:39.296 --> 00:40:41.556 A:middle
Now, let's talk about how you

00:40:41.556 --> 00:40:42.886 A:middle
can build a great experience on

00:40:42.886 --> 00:40:43.756 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:40:44.796 --> 00:40:46.076 A:middle
So, we've been working on the

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.516 A:middle
Siri watch face for a while now.

00:40:47.616 --> 00:40:48.576 A:middle
And, we've learned quite a few

00:40:48.576 --> 00:40:49.286 A:middle
things along the way.

00:40:51.556 --> 00:40:52.956 A:middle
First one of those things is

00:40:52.956 --> 00:40:54.426 A:middle
there's kind of, two high-level

00:40:54.426 --> 00:40:56.306 A:middle
categories of content that we

00:40:56.306 --> 00:40:57.656 A:middle
think works great on the Siri

00:40:57.656 --> 00:40:58.326 A:middle
watch face.

00:40:59.736 --> 00:41:00.616 A:middle
The first one of those is
