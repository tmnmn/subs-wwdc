00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
Whereas, Paul and I are having

00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:03.706 A:middle
very consistent conversations,

00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:05.056 A:middle
so the system can really quickly

00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:06.296 A:middle
pick up on this pattern, that

00:29:06.296 --> 00:29:07.206 A:middle
every morning, I'm sending

00:29:07.206 --> 00:29:10.486 A:middle
messages to Paul.

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:12.176 A:middle
Another little more interesting

00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:13.626 A:middle
example, is this app that I use

00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:14.736 A:middle
to order my morning coffee.

00:29:15.846 --> 00:29:17.166 A:middle
And again, this app has gone and

00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.356 A:middle
adopted Siri shortcuts.

00:29:18.746 --> 00:29:20.176 A:middle
So, they support a couple

00:29:20.176 --> 00:29:21.116 A:middle
different parameters.

00:29:21.346 --> 00:29:22.656 A:middle
The first one is the type of

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:23.546 A:middle
coffee I want to buy.

00:29:24.026 --> 00:29:25.606 A:middle
The next one is the condiments,

00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:26.786 A:middle
so do I want cream or sugar?

00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:29.146 A:middle
And, finally, the location that

00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:30.106 A:middle
I want to pick my coffee up

00:29:30.106 --> 00:29:30.376 A:middle
from.

00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.546 A:middle
So, every morning I use this app

00:29:33.546 --> 00:29:34.936 A:middle
and go place an order for my

00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:35.606 A:middle
morning coffee.

00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:37.076 A:middle
But, depending on where I have a

00:29:37.076 --> 00:29:38.426 A:middle
meeting, the location that I

00:29:38.426 --> 00:29:39.676 A:middle
want to pick my coffee up from

00:29:39.676 --> 00:29:40.656 A:middle
will change from day to day.

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.206 A:middle
Maybe I'm going to Infinite

00:29:42.206 --> 00:29:43.726 A:middle
Loop, or Apple Park, or up to

00:29:43.726 --> 00:29:45.556 A:middle
San Francisco, and I want to

00:29:45.556 --> 00:29:46.616 A:middle
pick up my coffee at, you know,

00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:47.416 A:middle
the closest store.

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:50.496 A:middle
So, again, because there's a lot

00:29:50.496 --> 00:29:52.056 A:middle
of variability in the location,

00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:53.436 A:middle
this may not make a good

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:54.276 A:middle
candidate for the primary

00:29:54.276 --> 00:29:54.906 A:middle
shortcut type.

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:56.366 A:middle
It's going to take a lot longer

00:29:56.366 --> 00:29:57.276 A:middle
for the system to, kind of,

00:29:57.276 --> 00:29:58.776 A:middle
understand the patterns in my

00:29:58.776 --> 00:29:59.296 A:middle
behavior.
