00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:00.246 A:middle
mind.

00:44:01.856 --> 00:44:03.606 A:middle
Your intents are running within

00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:04.806 A:middle
your Siri extension.

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.956 A:middle
And, this allows the system to

00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:09.046 A:middle
automatically run your intents

00:44:09.156 --> 00:44:10.476 A:middle
in the background, so the user

00:44:10.476 --> 00:44:11.776 A:middle
never has to leave the Siri

00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.186 A:middle
watch face to go run your

00:44:13.186 --> 00:44:13.626 A:middle
actions.

00:44:16.066 --> 00:44:17.486 A:middle
We always display the standard

00:44:17.486 --> 00:44:19.146 A:middle
system confirmation UI, so that

00:44:19.146 --> 00:44:21.086 A:middle
users know the action they're

00:44:21.086 --> 00:44:22.096 A:middle
going to run, and we can make

00:44:22.096 --> 00:44:23.226 A:middle
sure this is what they want to

00:44:23.226 --> 00:44:24.000 A:middle
perform.

00:44:27.046 --> 00:44:28.076 A:middle
You also want to make sure that

00:44:28.076 --> 00:44:29.176 A:middle
the relevant shortcuts that

00:44:29.176 --> 00:44:30.156 A:middle
you're creating are fully

00:44:30.156 --> 00:44:32.536 A:middle
specified, so that your intents

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:33.956 A:middle
extension can handle them

00:44:33.956 --> 00:44:35.166 A:middle
without any additional user

00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:35.886 A:middle
confirmation.

00:44:37.186 --> 00:44:38.896 A:middle
So that when the user taps on

00:44:38.896 --> 00:44:39.956 A:middle
one of these relevant shortcuts

00:44:39.956 --> 00:44:41.146 A:middle
on the Siri watch face, we don't

00:44:41.146 --> 00:44:42.596 A:middle
need to open up your app to

00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:43.676 A:middle
continue and get, you know,

00:44:43.676 --> 00:44:44.766 A:middle
additional information from the

00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:45.066 A:middle
user.

00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:47.136 A:middle
We can kick off your SiriKit

00:44:47.136 --> 00:44:48.516 A:middle
extension, run it in the

00:44:48.516 --> 00:44:49.786 A:middle
background, and the user can get

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:51.856 A:middle
on with their day.

00:44:52.946 --> 00:44:55.456 A:middle
And, you want to be providing

00:44:55.636 --> 00:44:57.596 A:middle
commonly used tasks within your

00:44:57.596 --> 00:44:58.986 A:middle
app as relevant shortcuts.

00:44:59.436 --> 00:45:00.636 A:middle
These are the kind of tasks that
