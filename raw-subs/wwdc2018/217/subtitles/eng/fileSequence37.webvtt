00:36:59.566 --> 00:37:01.376 A:middle
We actually use both these two

00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:02.696 A:middle
properties with the existing

00:37:02.696 --> 00:37:04.266 A:middle
location based reminders on the

00:37:04.266 --> 00:37:06.036 A:middle
Siri watch face, to get, kind

00:37:06.036 --> 00:37:07.686 A:middle
of, a geofencing-like behavior.

00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:12.106 A:middle
By default on CLRegion, both

00:37:12.106 --> 00:37:13.096 A:middle
these properties are set to

00:37:13.096 --> 00:37:13.476 A:middle
"true."

00:37:14.016 --> 00:37:15.386 A:middle
And, in that case, we'll

00:37:15.706 --> 00:37:17.226 A:middle
smoothly interpolate the

00:37:17.226 --> 00:37:18.766 A:middle
relevance based on how close the

00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:19.806 A:middle
user is to a particular

00:37:19.806 --> 00:37:20.346 A:middle
location.

00:37:21.716 --> 00:37:24.506 A:middle
And so, creating your CLRegion

00:37:24.556 --> 00:37:25.306 A:middle
is really easy.

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:27.866 A:middle
In this example, we're creating

00:37:27.866 --> 00:37:29.396 A:middle
one around Apple Park, so I've

00:37:29.486 --> 00:37:30.386 A:middle
brought in the coordinates for

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:32.546 A:middle
Apple Park, along with the

00:37:32.546 --> 00:37:33.026 A:middle
radius.

00:37:33.026 --> 00:37:34.256 A:middle
So, how close do I need to be?

00:37:34.526 --> 00:37:35.826 A:middle
In this case, 2 kilometers.

00:37:36.276 --> 00:37:39.366 A:middle
Next, I will go adjust the

00:37:39.366 --> 00:37:40.926 A:middle
notifyOnEntry, notifyOnExit

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:42.066 A:middle
properties as they make sense

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:42.836 A:middle
for my use case.

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:44.836 A:middle
And, once I have my region fully

00:37:44.836 --> 00:37:46.846 A:middle
configured, I can really easily

00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:47.266 A:middle
create a

00:37:47.266 --> 00:37:48.436 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.

00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:52.276 A:middle
A couple of quick notes about

00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:53.616 A:middle
the locationRelevanceProvider.

00:37:54.696 --> 00:37:56.086 A:middle
In order to use it, your app

00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:57.596 A:middle
needs location authorization,

00:37:57.736 --> 00:37:58.796 A:middle
otherwise we're going to ignore

00:37:58.796 --> 00:37:59.326 A:middle
this particular

00:37:59.326 --> 00:38:00.606 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.
