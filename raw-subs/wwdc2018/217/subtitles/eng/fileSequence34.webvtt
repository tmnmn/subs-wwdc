00:33:57.726 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
So, here's a couple cards that I

00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:01.516 A:middle
might have on my Siri watch

00:34:01.516 --> 00:34:01.786 A:middle
face.

00:34:01.856 --> 00:34:03.316 A:middle
The first is a reminder from

00:34:03.316 --> 00:34:06.096 A:middle
Calendar for a prep meeting for

00:34:06.656 --> 00:34:06.946 A:middle
this talk.

00:34:06.946 --> 00:34:08.206 A:middle
Next, is an app that I use that

00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:10.126 A:middle
gives me interesting tidbits of

00:34:10.126 --> 00:34:10.775 A:middle
space news.

00:34:11.786 --> 00:34:13.065 A:middle
And finally, we have this

00:34:13.065 --> 00:34:14.076 A:middle
fitness trainer app, so let's

00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:15.330 A:middle
focus in on that.

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:21.656 A:middle
So, I just woke up, I'm getting

00:34:21.656 --> 00:34:22.616 A:middle
ready for my day.

00:34:22.616 --> 00:34:24.016 A:middle
You know, it's, kind of, 8 A.M.

00:34:24.536 --> 00:34:25.815 A:middle
And so, you can see that this

00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:26.946 A:middle
fitness trainer app is actually

00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:28.206 A:middle
already starting to surface on

00:34:28.206 --> 00:34:29.216 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:34:29.686 --> 00:34:30.896 A:middle
We want to make sure that users

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:31.916 A:middle
are, kind of, aware of all the

00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:33.085 A:middle
things they have going on during

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.746 A:middle
the course of the day, but it's

00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:36.396 A:middle
kind of placed much lower on the

00:34:36.396 --> 00:34:36.726 A:middle
face.

00:34:36.726 --> 00:34:37.815 A:middle
It's not the most pressing thing

00:34:37.815 --> 00:34:38.686 A:middle
to the user right now.

00:34:39.795 --> 00:34:41.096 A:middle
But, as we start moving

00:34:41.096 --> 00:34:42.896 A:middle
throughout the day, right, that

00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:44.166 A:middle
calendar event that I had is no

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:45.146 A:middle
longer relevant to me.

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:46.505 A:middle
And so, this fitness trainer

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:47.696 A:middle
suggestion will start to bubble

00:34:47.696 --> 00:34:48.456 A:middle
up the face, right?

00:34:48.706 --> 00:34:49.876 A:middle
We're getting closer and closer

00:34:49.876 --> 00:34:51.246 A:middle
to 8 P.M. This content is

00:34:51.246 --> 00:34:53.226 A:middle
becoming more important to me.

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:55.556 A:middle
And, once we finally reach 8

00:34:55.556 --> 00:34:56.985 A:middle
P.M., right, this is the most

00:34:56.985 --> 00:34:57.996 A:middle
important thing to me right now.

00:34:58.176 --> 00:34:59.186 A:middle
Want to make sure I don't forget

00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:00.026 A:middle
to go for my run.
