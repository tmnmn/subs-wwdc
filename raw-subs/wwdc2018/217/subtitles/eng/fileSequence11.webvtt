00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:00.346 A:middle
intent you've defined in your

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:01.296 A:middle
intents definition file.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:04.336 A:middle
Additionally, that color is

00:11:04.336 --> 00:11:05.706 A:middle
chosen from your application's

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:07.266 A:middle
global tint color in your watch

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.056 A:middle
app storyboard.

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.886 A:middle
Now, it's very important to keep

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:11.946 A:middle
in mind that the intents that

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:13.226 A:middle
you support in your watch app

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:14.816 A:middle
must be a subset of the intents

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:15.686 A:middle
you support in your iOS

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:16.206 A:middle
application.

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:17.406 A:middle
That means you're going to be

00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:19.066 A:middle
sharing the same title strings,

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:21.196 A:middle
and subtitle strings on iOS and

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:21.836 A:middle
watchOS.

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:23.356 A:middle
And, watchOS is a very

00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:24.316 A:middle
constrained canvas.

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:25.446 A:middle
Every word counts.

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:27.426 A:middle
So, we highly recommend using

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:28.776 A:middle
string dictionaries, with the

00:11:28.776 --> 00:11:30.666 A:middle
NSStringVariableWidthRuleType

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:30.956 A:middle
key.

00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:32.636 A:middle
That allows you to give us a

00:11:32.636 --> 00:11:34.356 A:middle
list of varying sizes of strings

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:35.296 A:middle
that we can choose from,

00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:36.456 A:middle
depending on the context we're

00:11:36.456 --> 00:11:37.096 A:middle
displaying them in.

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.496 A:middle
When providing content to

00:11:39.496 --> 00:11:41.876 A:middle
watchOS, we recommend supplying

00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:43.776 A:middle
a string with a width rule of 20

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:45.616 A:middle
for a 38 millimeter watch.

00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:47.506 A:middle
And, a width rule of 24 for a 42

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:48.106 A:middle
millimeter watch.

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:51.266 A:middle
To get more information on

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:53.216 A:middle
adopting this API, please see

00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:54.476 A:middle
the "Localizing with Xcode 9"

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:55.166 A:middle
talk from last year's

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:55.706 A:middle
conference.

00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:58.726 A:middle
So now, let's talk about

00:11:58.726 --> 00:11:59.566 A:middle
relevance providers.
