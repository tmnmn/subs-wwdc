00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:01.436 A:middle
to the system, we can much more

00:28:01.436 --> 00:28:03.296 A:middle
quickly pick up on patterns in

00:28:03.296 --> 00:28:04.866 A:middle
the user behavior, and much more

00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:06.176 A:middle
quickly understand what are the

00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:07.336 A:middle
relevant shortcuts that the user

00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:08.236 A:middle
cares about most.

00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:11.836 A:middle
So, first up, we have this

00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:12.446 A:middle
Messaging app.

00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:13.766 A:middle
And so, this is something that

00:28:13.766 --> 00:28:14.806 A:middle
Paul and I have been using for a

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:16.046 A:middle
while now, so every morning

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:17.086 A:middle
we're sending messages back and

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:17.386 A:middle
forth.

00:28:17.776 --> 00:28:19.086 A:middle
Sometimes it's in preparation

00:28:19.086 --> 00:28:20.666 A:middle
for this talk, and other times

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.316 A:middle
it's about what cookies we want

00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:24.686 A:middle
to get at lunch.

00:28:24.846 --> 00:28:26.396 A:middle
And so, this app has gone ahead

00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:28.006 A:middle
and adopted Siri shortcuts.

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:29.096 A:middle
And, they defined a couple

00:28:29.096 --> 00:28:30.316 A:middle
different parameters that their

00:28:30.316 --> 00:28:30.996 A:middle
app supports.

00:28:31.256 --> 00:28:32.056 A:middle
So, the first one is the

00:28:32.056 --> 00:28:32.566 A:middle
recipient.

00:28:32.886 --> 00:28:34.106 A:middle
So, who am I sending a message

00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:34.326 A:middle
to?

00:28:34.376 --> 00:28:36.246 A:middle
And, the second one is the

00:28:36.246 --> 00:28:36.796 A:middle
message.

00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:38.126 A:middle
So, what is the content of the

00:28:38.126 --> 00:28:39.156 A:middle
message I'm trying to send?

00:28:40.416 --> 00:28:41.946 A:middle
So, like I mentioned before,

00:28:41.946 --> 00:28:43.206 A:middle
right, Paul and I are using this

00:28:43.206 --> 00:28:45.026 A:middle
app every single morning, but

00:28:45.026 --> 00:28:46.266 A:middle
the actual content of the

00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:47.396 A:middle
messages that we're sending

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:48.406 A:middle
varies from day to day.

00:28:49.366 --> 00:28:50.886 A:middle
So, because of this, this may

00:28:50.886 --> 00:28:52.166 A:middle
not make a good candidate for

00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:53.326 A:middle
the primary shortcut type.

00:28:53.326 --> 00:28:54.836 A:middle
It's going to take a lot longer

00:28:54.926 --> 00:28:56.126 A:middle
before the system can, kind of,

00:28:56.126 --> 00:28:57.806 A:middle
understand what are the

00:28:57.806 --> 00:28:59.026 A:middle
shortcuts I'm trying to perform.

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
Whereas, Paul and I are having
