00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:01.736 A:middle
So, while we're developing,

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:02.796 A:middle
we're going to want to go into

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.096 A:middle
the iOS Settings app, into the

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
Developer's page, and find the

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.456 A:middle
Shortcuts Testing section.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:10.456 A:middle
In there, we can ensure that our

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:11.906 A:middle
most recently provided relevant

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:13.376 A:middle
shortcuts show up at the top of

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.216 A:middle
the watch face, by enabling the

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.626 A:middle
Show Recent Shortcuts option.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.616 A:middle
Additionally, as we get further

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:23.146 A:middle
into adopting this API in our

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:25.216 A:middle
iOS application, we can cause

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:26.666 A:middle
the periodic syncing of relevant

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.346 A:middle
shortcuts from the iOS device to

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.816 A:middle
the watch to occur immediately

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:30.816 A:middle
by tapping the Force Sync

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:31.866 A:middle
Shortcuts to Watch button.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.616 A:middle
So, now let's talk about

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:36.426 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and at the

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.846 A:middle
core of a relevant shortcut, is

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:38.286 A:middle
a shortcut.

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:40.706 A:middle
Shortcuts encompass key

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.016 A:middle
functionality, within your

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.116 A:middle
application, that you want to

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:44.226 A:middle
make more accessible to your

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:44.606 A:middle
users.

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:46.126 A:middle
And, they can access these

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.336 A:middle
shortcuts by saying key phrases

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:49.066 A:middle
into Siri, or tapping on various

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:49.476 A:middle
system UI.

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:51.236 A:middle
And, in the case of watchOS,

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:52.376 A:middle
that's a platter on the Siri

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:53.606 A:middle
watch face.

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:55.626 A:middle
There's a lot of in-depth

00:03:55.626 --> 00:03:56.636 A:middle
discussion about how to make

00:03:56.686 --> 00:03:57.596 A:middle
great shortcuts this year.

00:03:57.656 --> 00:03:58.896 A:middle
And all will give a high-level

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
overview of how they work with a
