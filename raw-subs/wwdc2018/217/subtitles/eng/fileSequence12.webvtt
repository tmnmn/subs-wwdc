00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:02.676 A:middle
Relevance providers are your way

00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:04.146 A:middle
to give us a hint as to when we

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:05.116 A:middle
should show your content.

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:07.366 A:middle
They really let us know how we

00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:08.686 A:middle
should incorporate inputs like

00:12:08.716 --> 00:12:09.966 A:middle
the time of day, the user's

00:12:09.966 --> 00:12:11.536 A:middle
location, or their routine, when

00:12:11.536 --> 00:12:12.506 A:middle
calculating relevance.

00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:14.166 A:middle
And, in fact, you can give more

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.366 A:middle
than one relevance provider on a

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:16.266 A:middle
given relevance shortcut.

00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:17.526 A:middle
And, we're going to take the

00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:18.686 A:middle
inner section of their output.

00:12:19.016 --> 00:12:20.076 A:middle
So, if you give us a relevance

00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:21.286 A:middle
provider that says a certain

00:12:21.286 --> 00:12:22.296 A:middle
time of day's very important.

00:12:22.296 --> 00:12:23.336 A:middle
And, another one that says a

00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.606 A:middle
specific location's important,

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:26.256 A:middle
you'll get high relevance output

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:28.136 A:middle
when both it is that time of day

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.296 A:middle
and the user is at that

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:29.806 A:middle
location.

00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:31.866 A:middle
If instead you want the union of

00:12:31.866 --> 00:12:32.816 A:middle
these relevance providers,

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:33.756 A:middle
you're going to want to provide

00:12:33.906 --> 00:12:35.356 A:middle
two separate relevance

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:36.356 A:middle
shortcuts, each one with a

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.246 A:middle
different relevance provider.

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:39.716 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:40.586 A:middle
options we have available.

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:42.246 A:middle
The first one is

00:12:42.436 --> 00:12:44.726 A:middle
INDateRelevanceProvider, which

00:12:44.726 --> 00:12:45.656 A:middle
has a required startDate

00:12:45.656 --> 00:12:46.876 A:middle
parameter, and an optional

00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:47.536 A:middle
endDate parameter.

00:12:48.546 --> 00:12:49.516 A:middle
When you create an instance of

00:12:49.516 --> 00:12:50.986 A:middle
this relevance provider, the

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:52.416 A:middle
closer time of day gets to the

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:53.676 A:middle
start that you've provided, the

00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:54.866 A:middle
higher the relevance output of

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:55.346 A:middle
the provider.

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:57.596 A:middle
After that time of day passes,

00:12:57.836 --> 00:12:58.856 A:middle
the relevance will fall off on a

00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
curve, allowing more content to
