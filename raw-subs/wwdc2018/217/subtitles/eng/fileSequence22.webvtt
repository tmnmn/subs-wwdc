00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
current time, location, or other

00:22:01.726 --> 00:22:03.006 A:middle
factors from across the system.

00:22:03.526 --> 00:22:06.646 A:middle
And, to figure out what content

00:22:06.646 --> 00:22:07.676 A:middle
the user cares about, we're

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:09.276 A:middle
looking at how they interact

00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:10.786 A:middle
with the different platters on

00:22:10.786 --> 00:22:11.716 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:13.306 A:middle
What things are they tapping on?

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:14.196 A:middle
What things are they spending a

00:22:14.196 --> 00:22:15.246 A:middle
lot of time looking at?

00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:15.996 A:middle
And, what things are they

00:22:15.996 --> 00:22:17.636 A:middle
scrolling past to find other

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:18.166 A:middle
content?

00:22:18.696 --> 00:22:20.296 A:middle
And, we use all this information

00:22:20.296 --> 00:22:22.326 A:middle
to understand what are the

00:22:22.326 --> 00:22:23.436 A:middle
different platters that the user

00:22:23.436 --> 00:22:24.736 A:middle
wants to see right on a wrist

00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:25.066 A:middle
raise.

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
And so, because we're trying to

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:30.866 A:middle
surface, again, the content the

00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:32.726 A:middle
user cares about most, you want

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:33.246 A:middle
to make sure that you're

00:22:33.246 --> 00:22:34.846 A:middle
providing relevant, engaging

00:22:34.846 --> 00:22:36.246 A:middle
content to be surfaced on the

00:22:36.246 --> 00:22:36.976 A:middle
Siri watch face.

00:22:40.796 --> 00:22:42.026 A:middle
So, let's talk a little bit more

00:22:42.026 --> 00:22:43.846 A:middle
about how we actually put your

00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:44.896 A:middle
relevant shortcuts on the Siri

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:45.526 A:middle
watch face.

00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:47.346 A:middle
So, like Paul mentioned earlier,

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:48.416 A:middle
the first step is you need to

00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:49.596 A:middle
provide your relevant shortcuts

00:22:49.596 --> 00:22:50.916 A:middle
to the system, into the

00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:52.806 A:middle
defaultRelevantShortcutsStore.

00:22:54.006 --> 00:22:54.986 A:middle
Once you've provided your

00:22:54.986 --> 00:22:56.946 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, we can run

00:22:56.946 --> 00:22:57.816 A:middle
them through our machine

00:22:57.816 --> 00:22:58.846 A:middle
learning model to figure out

00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:00.136 A:middle
what is the best way to be
