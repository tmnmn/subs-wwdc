00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.346 A:middle
with this app may be for cooking

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.446 A:middle
dinner, whereas for you it might

00:33:02.446 --> 00:33:03.326 A:middle
be for cooking lunch.

00:33:04.876 --> 00:33:06.336 A:middle
And so, in this case, we may

00:33:06.556 --> 00:33:08.526 A:middle
actually indicate an empty set

00:33:08.526 --> 00:33:09.566 A:middle
of relevanceProviders.

00:33:12.146 --> 00:33:13.496 A:middle
And, in this case, the system

00:33:13.496 --> 00:33:15.166 A:middle
will determine the relevance of

00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:17.016 A:middle
this particular shortcut based

00:33:17.016 --> 00:33:18.216 A:middle
on how the user's interacted

00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:19.046 A:middle
with it before.

00:33:19.346 --> 00:33:20.736 A:middle
So, for me, I always use this

00:33:20.736 --> 00:33:22.096 A:middle
around 7 P.M. because that's

00:33:22.096 --> 00:33:23.436 A:middle
when I go cook dinner, so that's

00:33:23.436 --> 00:33:24.496 A:middle
when the system will start to

00:33:24.756 --> 00:33:26.356 A:middle
surface this particular relevant

00:33:26.906 --> 00:33:27.126 A:middle
shortcut.

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:30.086 A:middle
If we take a look, however, at

00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:31.446 A:middle
this fitness trainer app, which

00:33:31.746 --> 00:33:33.006 A:middle
does have a concrete time

00:33:33.006 --> 00:33:34.626 A:middle
associated with it, you can

00:33:34.626 --> 00:33:36.156 A:middle
provide that by creating a

00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:37.846 A:middle
dateRelevanceProvider, and in

00:33:37.846 --> 00:33:39.406 A:middle
this case providing the 8 P.M.

00:33:39.406 --> 00:33:39.926 A:middle
start time.

00:33:42.606 --> 00:33:43.906 A:middle
And, by giving this information

00:33:43.906 --> 00:33:45.846 A:middle
to the system, we will surface

00:33:45.846 --> 00:33:47.496 A:middle
this content around a specific

00:33:47.496 --> 00:33:48.146 A:middle
time of day.

00:33:49.596 --> 00:33:50.776 A:middle
And, as you move closer and

00:33:50.776 --> 00:33:52.256 A:middle
closer and closer to 8 P.M.,

00:33:52.346 --> 00:33:53.596 A:middle
this content becomes more and

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:54.656 A:middle
more relevant to the user.

00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:56.506 A:middle
So, let's look at what-- that.

00:33:57.726 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
So, here's a couple cards that I
