00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:02.116 A:middle
looking at, tapping through, but

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:02.956 A:middle
not scrolling past.

00:18:04.286 --> 00:18:05.126 A:middle
When you get one of these

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:06.716 A:middle
refresh background tasks, it's

00:18:06.716 --> 00:18:08.366 A:middle
your opportunity to update the

00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:10.046 A:middle
data that supplies your relevant

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:11.596 A:middle
shortcuts, and give us a fresh

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:12.576 A:middle
set of relevant shortcuts.

00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:15.976 A:middle
And, on a related note, if your

00:18:15.976 --> 00:18:17.136 A:middle
background-capable intent

00:18:17.136 --> 00:18:18.586 A:middle
executes, it's inside of your

00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:19.376 A:middle
intents extension.

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:20.796 A:middle
That means that if you update

00:18:20.796 --> 00:18:22.126 A:middle
your data store, it's possible

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:22.966 A:middle
that your UI and your

00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
application has become stale.

00:18:25.526 --> 00:18:26.796 A:middle
So, in watchOS 5, we've also

00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:28.416 A:middle
created the

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:30.056 A:middle
WKIntentDidRunRefresh

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:30.776 A:middle
BackgroundTask.

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:32.086 A:middle
And, we'll hand that to you with

00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:33.606 A:middle
some runtime when your intents

00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:35.396 A:middle
extension completes a execution

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:35.926 A:middle
of a shortcut.

00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:38.326 A:middle
That is your opportunity to make

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.646 A:middle
sure that your UI's up to date,

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:41.526 A:middle
perhaps request an updated

00:18:41.526 --> 00:18:43.806 A:middle
snapshot, or reload, or extend

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:44.866 A:middle
your complication timeline.

00:18:45.236 --> 00:18:48.916 A:middle
So, let's talk about how we can

00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:50.596 A:middle
take advantage of these API's on

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:50.926 A:middle
iOS.

00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:52.746 A:middle
And, the great news is, with the

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:53.686 A:middle
exception of those

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:55.666 A:middle
WKRefreshBackgroundTasks, we can

00:18:55.666 --> 00:18:57.646 A:middle
use all of the same exact API's

00:18:57.876 --> 00:18:58.996 A:middle
in our iOS application.
