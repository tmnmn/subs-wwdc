00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:00.836 A:middle
In the bottom two cases, if

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:02.126 A:middle
there's no subtitle, we'll allow

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:03.206 A:middle
the title string to wrap from

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.330 A:middle
the top line to the bottom line.

00:10:06.616 --> 00:10:08.796 A:middle
If your shortcut is based on an

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.246 A:middle
intent, when a user taps on it,

00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:11.146 A:middle
they'll see this intent

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:11.906 A:middle
confirmation view.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:13.546 A:middle
In the top left is your

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:14.736 A:middle
application's icon, which is a

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:15.946 A:middle
bit bigger this time, followed

00:10:15.946 --> 00:10:16.666 A:middle
by your app's name.

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:18.416 A:middle
Below that we'll display the

00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:19.936 A:middle
title and subtitle directly from

00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.026 A:middle
your intents definition file.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
And, at this point, the user has

00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:23.516 A:middle
three options.

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:25.286 A:middle
If they want to run your intent,

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:26.716 A:middle
they can click Confirm in that

00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:27.566 A:middle
middle pink button.

00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:28.996 A:middle
If they don't want to run it,

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:30.406 A:middle
they can tap dismiss or the

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:30.976 A:middle
digital crown.

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:32.596 A:middle
And then, the third option is a

00:10:32.596 --> 00:10:33.266 A:middle
bit more subtle.

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:35.486 A:middle
Sometimes users see an intent,

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:37.076 A:middle
realize they want to tweak some

00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:37.886 A:middle
of the parameters.

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:40.426 A:middle
So, they can tap that top

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:41.926 A:middle
module, and we'll launch into

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:43.276 A:middle
your application, and hand you

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.486 A:middle
the intent you've customized.

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:46.146 A:middle
So, you can present some UI to

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.376 A:middle
allow your users to tweak some

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:48.376 A:middle
of the parameters before

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:49.356 A:middle
continuing execution.

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:51.616 A:middle
Now, let's talk about that

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:53.166 A:middle
middle pink Confirm button a

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:55.186 A:middle
little bit more.

00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:56.306 A:middle
The string we show there, where

00:10:56.306 --> 00:10:57.806 A:middle
it says Action Verb, is derived

00:10:57.806 --> 00:10:58.976 A:middle
based off of the category of

00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:00.346 A:middle
intent you've defined in your
