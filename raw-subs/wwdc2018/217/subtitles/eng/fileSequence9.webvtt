00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:00.706 A:middle
order of parameters you have

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:01.576 A:middle
listed in your intents

00:09:01.576 --> 00:09:02.256 A:middle
definition file.

00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:05.106 A:middle
In the case of an

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:06.906 A:middle
NSUserActivity, when you're

00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:07.926 A:middle
creating your userActivity to

00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:09.536 A:middle
make a shortcut, you'll supply

00:09:09.536 --> 00:09:10.896 A:middle
it-- userActivity type that

00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:11.776 A:middle
you've listed in your app's

00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:12.776 A:middle
info.plist.

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:13.986 A:middle
And, for us to be able to

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.076 A:middle
display it without a default

00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:16.116 A:middle
card template, you'll need to

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:17.176 A:middle
give us a title on the title

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:17.596 A:middle
property.

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:20.486 A:middle
In iOS you can also supply a

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:22.526 A:middle
subtitle and a custom image by

00:09:22.526 --> 00:09:22.896 A:middle
creating a

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.066 A:middle
CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:27.336 A:middle
And, on that attribute set,

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
we'll extract a subtitle from

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:29.456 A:middle
the content description

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:31.146 A:middle
property, and the custom image

00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:32.306 A:middle
from the thumbnailData property.

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:34.426 A:middle
When you're done configuring

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:35.926 A:middle
this attribute set, set on your

00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:36.926 A:middle
NSUserActivity's

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:38.336 A:middle
contentAttributeSet property.

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:42.216 A:middle
If you don't want to give us the

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.856 A:middle
content that's baked into your

00:09:43.856 --> 00:09:44.846 A:middle
shortcut, you can supply a

00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:46.306 A:middle
default card template, which has

00:09:46.306 --> 00:09:47.156 A:middle
properties for each of the

00:09:47.156 --> 00:09:48.066 A:middle
fields on this platter.

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:49.376 A:middle
And, depending on what we have

00:09:49.376 --> 00:09:51.106 A:middle
available to us, we will display

00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:51.796 A:middle
a different layout.

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:53.296 A:middle
You can see in the right two

00:09:53.296 --> 00:09:54.746 A:middle
configurations, that if no image

00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:55.796 A:middle
is provided, we'll lay out the

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.296 A:middle
text further to the left, giving

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:58.696 A:middle
you more space for your words.

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:00.836 A:middle
