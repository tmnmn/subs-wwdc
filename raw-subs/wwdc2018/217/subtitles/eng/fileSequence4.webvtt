00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
overview of how they work with a

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:01.526 A:middle
watchOS persecutive.

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:02.946 A:middle
I highly recommend seeing the

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:04.246 A:middle
"Introduction to Siri Shortcuts"

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:05.716 A:middle
talk, and the "Building for

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:07.356 A:middle
Voice with Siri Shortcuts" that

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:08.046 A:middle
happened earlier in the

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:08.626 A:middle
conference.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:11.646 A:middle
So, shortcuts can be made out of

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:12.506 A:middle
one of two things.

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:14.686 A:middle
An NSUserActivity, which

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:15.836 A:middle
represents a state within your

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:16.706 A:middle
application you want to

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:19.096 A:middle
accelerate users back into, or

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:20.796 A:middle
an intent, which can execute a

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.166 A:middle
task on your user's behalf.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:23.886 A:middle
Now, intents are really

00:04:23.886 --> 00:04:24.876 A:middle
powerful, because they can

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:26.076 A:middle
support background execution,

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:27.676 A:middle
which means that users can take

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:28.866 A:middle
advantage of your functionality

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:29.956 A:middle
without having to launch your

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:30.736 A:middle
app into the foreground.

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:32.696 A:middle
In fact, users can request

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:34.256 A:middle
background-capable intents that

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:35.226 A:middle
are available on their iPhone

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:36.266 A:middle
from their Apple watch or

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
HomePod.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.086 A:middle
And, our frameworks provide a

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:40.316 A:middle
lot of built-in intents you can

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:41.386 A:middle
take advantage of right now,

00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:43.236 A:middle
like sending a message, starting

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:44.606 A:middle
a workout, or requesting a ride.

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.916 A:middle
But, new in watchOS 5, and iOS

00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:48.626 A:middle
12, you can make your own custom

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:49.666 A:middle
intents that have the

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.056 A:middle
functionality that your app does

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:51.426 A:middle
best.

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:53.836 A:middle
There's this awesome in-depth

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.616 A:middle
intents definition file and

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:56.736 A:middle
editor built into Xcode.

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:57.906 A:middle
And, I'll give you a couple of

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:58.886 A:middle
pointers related to relevant

00:04:58.886 --> 00:04:59.386 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
But, I highly recommend seeing
