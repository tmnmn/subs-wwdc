00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:01.306 A:middle
content is, the higher up on the

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:02.386 A:middle
watch face it's going to appear.

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:04.196 A:middle
And, we calculate relevance by

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:05.936 A:middle
incorporating a number of inputs

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.286 A:middle
across the system, like the

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.776 A:middle
current time of day, the user's

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.446 A:middle
location, their routine, and

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:11.546 A:middle
their engagement with a given

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:12.136 A:middle
data source.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:14.596 A:middle
You'll provide this content to

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:15.946 A:middle
us with a relevantShortcut,

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.346 A:middle
which associates a shortcut with

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.576 A:middle
UI customization, and the

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:20.626 A:middle
ability to give us hints as to

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:21.786 A:middle
when to deploy your content.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.796 A:middle
Now, we will derive implicit

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:25.876 A:middle
relevance for the shortcuts you

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:27.426 A:middle
provide based off of your user's

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:28.556 A:middle
past interaction with the

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:29.106 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.036 A:middle
But, often you have much more

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:32.116 A:middle
insightful suggestions,

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:33.146 A:middle
especially when showing

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.606 A:middle
glanceable information, or if

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:35.626 A:middle
you want to suggest a shortcut

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:36.836 A:middle
that hasn't yet been executed by

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:37.206 A:middle
a user.

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.466 A:middle
So, you can provide us things

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:39.466 A:middle
called relevance providers.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:41.866 A:middle
And, just like a first-party

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:43.756 A:middle
data source, users can disable

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:46.036 A:middle
or re-enable your data source in

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:47.536 A:middle
the Siri face customization page

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:49.126 A:middle
in the iOS Watch app.

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:51.726 A:middle
Now, before we get too far into

00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:52.736 A:middle
adopting the Relevant Shortcut

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.276 A:middle
API, we want to make sure we're

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.146 A:middle
not contending with these

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:56.676 A:middle
relevance calculations when we

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.216 A:middle
see how our relevant shortcuts

00:02:58.396 --> 00:02:59.546 A:middle
behave and look on the watch

00:02:59.546 --> 00:02:59.916 A:middle
face.
