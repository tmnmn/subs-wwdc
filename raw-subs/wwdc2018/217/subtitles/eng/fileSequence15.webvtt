00:14:58.896 --> 00:15:00.136 A:middle
So, we want to give the system a

00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
hint that this should be

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:02.406 A:middle
displayed in the evening by

00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:02.926 A:middle
passing a

00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:04.566 A:middle
dailyRoutineRelevanceProvider

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:05.636 A:middle
with the situation .evening.

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:07.076 A:middle
And now that our

00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:08.306 A:middle
relevantShortcut is configured,

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:09.246 A:middle
we can pass it along to the

00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:10.466 A:middle
default relevantShortcutStore.

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:14.006 A:middle
For our next example, in our

00:15:14.006 --> 00:15:15.466 A:middle
application, users also have a

00:15:15.466 --> 00:15:16.346 A:middle
bunch of favorites they can

00:15:16.346 --> 00:15:17.786 A:middle
configure for snacks they eat

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:19.196 A:middle
often, or perhaps a breakfast

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:19.886 A:middle
they had every day.

00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:20.726 A:middle
So, we've created a

00:15:20.726 --> 00:15:23.176 A:middle
logFavoriteMealIntent.

00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:25.206 A:middle
We want a couple of these to

00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.146 A:middle
surface on the watch face to

00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:27.206 A:middle
make it even easier for our

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.226 A:middle
users to log their favorite

00:15:28.226 --> 00:15:28.936 A:middle
snacks and meals.

00:15:29.736 --> 00:15:30.896 A:middle
So, we'll create an instance of

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.806 A:middle
our intent, and take one of our

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:33.736 A:middle
favorites, and set it on the

00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:34.466 A:middle
favorites parameter.

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.256 A:middle
In this case, our user likes to

00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:36.746 A:middle
eat cookies.

00:15:36.986 --> 00:15:39.496 A:middle
We'll also set an image for that

00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:40.936 A:middle
parameter, so that when it shows

00:15:40.936 --> 00:15:42.106 A:middle
up on the watch face, they get a

00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:43.136 A:middle
little bit more context about

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:43.876 A:middle
what they're about to log.

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:46.146 A:middle
From here, we can take our

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.416 A:middle
intent and create a shortcut,

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:48.646 A:middle
and from our shortcut, create a

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:49.316 A:middle
relevantShortcut.

00:15:50.536 --> 00:15:51.416 A:middle
At this point, we're ready to

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:52.636 A:middle
pass along our relevantShortcut

00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:54.106 A:middle
to the relevant shortcut store.

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:55.656 A:middle
We don't need a default card

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:56.806 A:middle
template, because the title

00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:58.236 A:middle
strings and image, the image

00:15:58.236 --> 00:15:59.056 A:middle
that we pass along to our

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.086 A:middle
intent, should be sufficient.
