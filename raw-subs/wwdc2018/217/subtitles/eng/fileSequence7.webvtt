00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.136 A:middle
launched into the appropriate

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
context.

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:03.756 A:middle
If instead, your app is-- or,

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.886 A:middle
your shortcut is based off of

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:06.316 A:middle
intents, when the user taps on

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:07.476 A:middle
the platter, we'll see this

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:08.516 A:middle
intent confirmation view.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:10.556 A:middle
And, if they tap to confirm it,

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:11.906 A:middle
if your intent runs at the

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:13.106 A:middle
background, we'll execute it

00:07:13.106 --> 00:07:13.536 A:middle
inline.

00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:15.906 A:middle
If instead your intent can't run

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:16.976 A:middle
in the background, we'll launch

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:18.166 A:middle
your application, and hand you

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.156 A:middle
the intent to continue

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:19.716 A:middle
execution.

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:22.556 A:middle
So, let's look at the API for

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
Relevant Shortcuts.

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:25.146 A:middle
At the core of a relevant

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:25.976 A:middle
shortcut, of course, is a

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:26.396 A:middle
shortcut.

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:28.286 A:middle
If you want to give us hints as

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:29.086 A:middle
to when this content is

00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:30.166 A:middle
relevant, you can provide us

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.256 A:middle
relevanceProviders, which we'll

00:07:31.256 --> 00:07:31.806 A:middle
go over soon.

00:07:33.196 --> 00:07:34.186 A:middle
And, if you want to customize

00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:36.216 A:middle
the UI beyond what your shortcut

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:37.916 A:middle
will provide, you can give us a

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.196 A:middle
defaultCardTemplate on the

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.106 A:middle
watchTemplate property.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:43.246 A:middle
Now, once you're done creating

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:44.166 A:middle
all of your wonderful relevant

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.146 A:middle
shortcuts, you need to let us

00:07:45.146 --> 00:07:45.676 A:middle
know about them.

00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:46.886 A:middle
So, you want to inform the

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.186 A:middle
default relevantShortcutStore.

00:07:48.696 --> 00:07:49.696 A:middle
And, the way you do that is

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:50.576 A:middle
providing an array.

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:52.066 A:middle
And, every time you give us an

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.286 A:middle
array, it'll erase the previous

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:54.596 A:middle
contents we had in our shortcut

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:55.946 A:middle
store, which is really useful

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:57.246 A:middle
for invalidating stale relevant

00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:57.786 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:07:58.116 --> 00:07:58.846 A:middle
But, you just need to keep in

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.406 A:middle
mind to provide us all of the
