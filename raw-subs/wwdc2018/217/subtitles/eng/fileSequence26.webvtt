00:26:01.216 --> 00:26:03.166 A:middle
New in watchOS 5, though, there

00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:03.906 A:middle
is this method

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:05.816 A:middle
updateUserActivity on

00:26:05.816 --> 00:26:07.706 A:middle
WKInterfaceController, where you

00:26:07.706 --> 00:26:09.596 A:middle
can attach your user activity to

00:26:09.596 --> 00:26:11.226 A:middle
an interfaceController, and

00:26:11.226 --> 00:26:11.776 A:middle
whenever this

00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:13.036 A:middle
interfaceController's visible to

00:26:13.116 --> 00:26:14.336 A:middle
the user, the system will

00:26:14.336 --> 00:26:15.836 A:middle
automatically be donating the

00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:17.166 A:middle
user activities on your behalf.

00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:19.416 A:middle
This is similar to the API's

00:26:19.416 --> 00:26:21.116 A:middle
that we have over on iOS, on

00:26:21.116 --> 00:26:22.036 A:middle
UIViewController, and

00:26:22.036 --> 00:26:23.536 A:middle
UIResponder, where you can, kind

00:26:23.536 --> 00:26:26.116 A:middle
of, attach an NSUserActivity to

00:26:26.116 --> 00:26:26.796 A:middle
a piece of your UI.

00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:29.166 A:middle
And so now, this is the

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:30.846 A:middle
recommended way to be providing

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:32.286 A:middle
NSUserActivity donations on

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:32.966 A:middle
watchOS.

00:26:34.416 --> 00:26:37.436 A:middle
If your shortcuts are backed by

00:26:37.436 --> 00:26:39.786 A:middle
an intent, you can provide those

00:26:39.886 --> 00:26:41.726 A:middle
intent donations by using the

00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:42.786 A:middle
INInteraction API.

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:45.096 A:middle
So, if you attended any of the

00:26:45.096 --> 00:26:46.166 A:middle
previous shortcut talks, this

00:26:46.166 --> 00:26:47.286 A:middle
probably looks familiar to you.

00:26:47.286 --> 00:26:49.696 A:middle
But, to provide this donation,

00:26:49.696 --> 00:26:50.786 A:middle
first you create your intent,

00:26:51.196 --> 00:26:52.656 A:middle
and adjust any parameters as

00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:53.576 A:middle
they're necessary for what the

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:54.636 A:middle
user just did within your app.

00:26:55.506 --> 00:26:56.596 A:middle
Next, you create your

00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.476 A:middle
INInteraction with intent, and

00:26:58.476 --> 00:27:00.276 A:middle
call the donate method when
