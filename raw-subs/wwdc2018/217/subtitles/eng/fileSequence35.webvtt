00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:00.026 A:middle
to go for my run.

00:35:00.026 --> 00:35:02.136 A:middle
So, it'd be surfaced up at the

00:35:02.136 --> 00:35:05.926 A:middle
top of the Siri watch face.

00:35:06.056 --> 00:35:07.026 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:35:07.026 --> 00:35:08.436 A:middle
travel guide app, which again is

00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:10.236 A:middle
trying to surface content around

00:35:10.306 --> 00:35:11.396 A:middle
interesting locations of

00:35:11.396 --> 00:35:12.316 A:middle
interest the user.

00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:15.896 A:middle
And, as you may have guessed,

00:35:15.896 --> 00:35:17.096 A:middle
you can provide this information

00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:18.086 A:middle
to the system using a

00:35:18.086 --> 00:35:19.466 A:middle
locationRelevanceProvider.

00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:21.646 A:middle
In this case, near Golden Gate

00:35:21.696 --> 00:35:22.006 A:middle
Park.

00:35:24.176 --> 00:35:26.006 A:middle
And, by providing this

00:35:26.006 --> 00:35:27.616 A:middle
information to the system, we

00:35:27.616 --> 00:35:29.226 A:middle
will automatically be surfacing

00:35:29.226 --> 00:35:30.746 A:middle
this content when the user

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:31.896 A:middle
starts getting close to Golden

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:32.366 A:middle
Gate Park.

00:35:33.376 --> 00:35:34.376 A:middle
And, again, as the user gets

00:35:34.376 --> 00:35:35.606 A:middle
closer and closer and closer to

00:35:35.606 --> 00:35:37.046 A:middle
Golden Gate Park, this content

00:35:37.046 --> 00:35:38.216 A:middle
becomes more relevant to them.

00:35:40.276 --> 00:35:42.216 A:middle
So, if I just arrive up in San

00:35:42.216 --> 00:35:43.606 A:middle
Francisco, you can see that

00:35:43.606 --> 00:35:44.516 A:middle
we're already starting to

00:35:44.516 --> 00:35:45.986 A:middle
surface this suggestion to go

00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:47.006 A:middle
check out Golden Gate Park.

00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:48.726 A:middle
It's displayed lower on the

00:35:48.726 --> 00:35:49.796 A:middle
face, because it's not the most

00:35:49.796 --> 00:35:50.966 A:middle
pressing thing to me right now.

00:35:50.966 --> 00:35:52.586 A:middle
But, we want to make sure that

00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:54.166 A:middle
the user is aware about this.

00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:57.466 A:middle
And, as I move closer and closer

00:35:57.466 --> 00:35:58.756 A:middle
to Golden Gate Park, this

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:00.156 A:middle
content becomes more relevant to
