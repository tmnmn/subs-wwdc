00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.086 A:middle
The relevant shortcuts we

00:19:01.086 --> 00:19:02.656 A:middle
provide in our iOS app will be

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:03.716 A:middle
periodically synced from the

00:19:03.716 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
phone to the watch.

00:19:04.496 --> 00:19:05.896 A:middle
And, merged in with local,

00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:06.766 A:middle
relevant shortcuts for

00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:08.256 A:middle
consideration to be displayed on

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:08.866 A:middle
the watch face.

00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:10.976 A:middle
You have all of the same UI

00:19:10.976 --> 00:19:12.656 A:middle
customization options available.

00:19:12.996 --> 00:19:14.286 A:middle
The only difference is if your

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:15.446 A:middle
relevant shortcut will execute

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:16.726 A:middle
back on the phone, we'll show

00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:18.096 A:middle
your iOS application's icon

00:19:18.096 --> 00:19:18.896 A:middle
instead of your watchOS

00:19:18.896 --> 00:19:19.706 A:middle
applications icon.

00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:23.146 A:middle
And now that we can be showing

00:19:23.146 --> 00:19:24.146 A:middle
relevant shortcuts that will

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:25.026 A:middle
execute on the phone or the

00:19:25.026 --> 00:19:26.276 A:middle
watch, let's talk about where

00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:27.156 A:middle
they will execute when the user

00:19:27.156 --> 00:19:28.316 A:middle
taps on them.

00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:31.246 A:middle
If a relevant shortcut can be

00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:32.406 A:middle
handled by an application that's

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:33.796 A:middle
installed locally on your watch,

00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:35.046 A:middle
regardless of where it came

00:19:35.046 --> 00:19:36.916 A:middle
from, we're going to execute it

00:19:36.956 --> 00:19:38.166 A:middle
in the watchOS application.

00:19:38.836 --> 00:19:40.116 A:middle
That gives the user the best

00:19:40.116 --> 00:19:41.296 A:middle
experience and the lowest

00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:41.726 A:middle
latency.

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
You can ensure that your watchOS

00:19:44.386 --> 00:19:45.956 A:middle
application supports execution

00:19:45.956 --> 00:19:47.336 A:middle
of a shortcut by making sure the

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:48.986 A:middle
user activity's activityType is

00:19:48.986 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
in your info.plist,

00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:51.766 A:middle
NSUserActivityTyped array.

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:53.816 A:middle
Or, if it's an intent, that your

00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:55.156 A:middle
intent is listed in your intents

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:55.656 A:middle
extension.

00:19:56.226 --> 00:19:58.736 A:middle
If instead there is no

00:19:58.736 --> 00:19:59.826 A:middle
application installed that can

00:19:59.826 --> 00:20:01.956 A:middle
handle your shortcut, except on
