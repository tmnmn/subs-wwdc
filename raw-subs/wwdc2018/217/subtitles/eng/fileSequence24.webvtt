00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:00.676 A:middle
personalized to each user.

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.526 A:middle
All of our learning happens

00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:05.496 A:middle
on-device, and we're building a

00:24:05.496 --> 00:24:07.306 A:middle
model for each and every single

00:24:07.306 --> 00:24:08.806 A:middle
user of the Siri watch face.

00:24:08.876 --> 00:24:10.126 A:middle
The way that you interact with

00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:11.226 A:middle
the watch face may be different

00:24:11.226 --> 00:24:12.116 A:middle
from the way that I interact

00:24:12.116 --> 00:24:12.646 A:middle
with the watch.

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:15.546 A:middle
And, once we have this model

00:24:15.546 --> 00:24:17.436 A:middle
trained we can then take your

00:24:17.436 --> 00:24:19.326 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and again,

00:24:19.406 --> 00:24:20.586 A:middle
surface them on the Siri watch

00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:21.796 A:middle
face based on their relevance to

00:24:21.796 --> 00:24:21.976 A:middle
the user.

00:24:26.416 --> 00:24:27.376 A:middle
If you attended some of the

00:24:27.376 --> 00:24:29.136 A:middle
previous shortcut talks, you may

00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:30.396 A:middle
have heard about donations.

00:24:31.126 --> 00:24:32.726 A:middle
This is your way to indicate to

00:24:32.726 --> 00:24:34.606 A:middle
the system what the user's doing

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:35.266 A:middle
within your app.

00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:37.926 A:middle
And, although they don't

00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:39.186 A:middle
actually surface within the UI

00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:41.816 A:middle
of the Siri watch face, we take

00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:43.176 A:middle
them into account when trying to

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:44.346 A:middle
understand the user's past

00:24:44.346 --> 00:24:44.886 A:middle
behavior.

00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:49.556 A:middle
So, again, donations are your

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:51.406 A:middle
way to indicate important tasks,

00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:53.186 A:middle
or other information about what

00:24:53.186 --> 00:24:54.816 A:middle
users are doing inside of your

00:24:54.816 --> 00:24:56.416 A:middle
applications, and providing that

00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:56.936 A:middle
to the system.

00:24:58.546 --> 00:25:00.006 A:middle
And, by giving this information
