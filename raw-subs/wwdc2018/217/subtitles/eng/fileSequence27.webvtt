00:26:58.476 --> 00:27:00.276 A:middle
call the donate method when

00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:01.456 A:middle
users perform this particular

00:27:01.456 --> 00:27:01.916 A:middle
interaction.

00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:05.556 A:middle
The other thing to look out for,

00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:07.526 A:middle
is this primary shortcut type

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:09.466 A:middle
for when we're making watchOS

00:27:09.466 --> 00:27:09.936 A:middle
predictions.

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:11.906 A:middle
And so, let's take a look at

00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:12.716 A:middle
this.

00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:15.216 A:middle
Inside of the Xcode intents

00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:16.466 A:middle
editor, you'll notice that

00:27:16.466 --> 00:27:18.326 A:middle
there's a field to select the

00:27:18.326 --> 00:27:19.446 A:middle
primary shortcut type.

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:21.666 A:middle
So, this allows you to indicate

00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:22.676 A:middle
to the system, like, kind of,

00:27:22.676 --> 00:27:24.296 A:middle
the most critical use cases for

00:27:24.296 --> 00:27:24.646 A:middle
your app.

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:26.616 A:middle
And so, let's talk more about

00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:29.366 A:middle
what that means.

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:31.786 A:middle
So, by indicating the primary

00:27:31.786 --> 00:27:33.086 A:middle
shortcut type, you're, kind of,

00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:34.696 A:middle
telling the system what are the

00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:36.206 A:middle
use cases that you think your

00:27:36.206 --> 00:27:37.426 A:middle
users care about most.

00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:38.906 A:middle
And, this helps us expedite our

00:27:38.906 --> 00:27:39.766 A:middle
learning process.

00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:42.616 A:middle
You can indicate one of these

00:27:42.686 --> 00:27:43.866 A:middle
per intent that you've defined.

00:27:45.616 --> 00:27:46.986 A:middle
And, for the best performance,

00:27:47.246 --> 00:27:48.846 A:middle
the parameter combination, the

00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:50.436 A:middle
selection, have a subset of the

00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.526 A:middle
parameters that you're providing

00:27:51.526 --> 00:27:52.536 A:middle
in your relevant shortcuts.

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:53.786 A:middle
And, we'll walk through a couple

00:27:53.786 --> 00:27:54.796 A:middle
of examples to try to better

00:27:54.796 --> 00:27:58.066 A:middle
understand what that means.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.746 A:middle
But, by giving this information

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:01.436 A:middle
to the system, we can much more
