00:44:59.436 --> 00:45:00.636 A:middle
These are the kind of tasks that

00:45:00.636 --> 00:45:01.866 A:middle
users are using your apps a lot

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.436 A:middle
for, and that they want to have

00:45:03.436 --> 00:45:04.746 A:middle
really quick and easy access to

00:45:04.746 --> 00:45:06.986 A:middle
from the watch face.

00:45:07.796 --> 00:45:09.456 A:middle
And, you also want to make sure

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.456 A:middle
that you're providing relevant

00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:11.276 A:middle
shortcuts often.

00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:13.136 A:middle
You may not know the last time

00:45:13.136 --> 00:45:14.156 A:middle
that you provided relevant

00:45:14.156 --> 00:45:16.146 A:middle
shortcuts to the system is, and

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:16.886 A:middle
you want to make sure that your

00:45:16.886 --> 00:45:18.806 A:middle
users can always access your

00:45:18.806 --> 00:45:19.826 A:middle
actions right from the Siri

00:45:19.826 --> 00:45:20.436 A:middle
watch face.

00:45:21.376 --> 00:45:22.626 A:middle
If you're going to be providing

00:45:22.626 --> 00:45:23.826 A:middle
these when your app starts up,

00:45:24.166 --> 00:45:25.576 A:middle
do it on a background thread so

00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:27.116 A:middle
you're not slowing down your app

00:45:27.116 --> 00:45:27.396 A:middle
launch.

00:45:28.026 --> 00:45:31.356 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about

00:45:31.566 --> 00:45:33.186 A:middle
relevant shortcuts, and the ways

00:45:33.186 --> 00:45:34.416 A:middle
that you can surface your

00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:36.286 A:middle
information and actions right on

00:45:36.286 --> 00:45:37.166 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:40.456 A:middle
You want to make sure that

00:45:40.456 --> 00:45:42.286 A:middle
you're also providing relevant

00:45:42.286 --> 00:45:43.406 A:middle
and engaging content.

00:45:43.726 --> 00:45:44.846 A:middle
This is the kind of content that

00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:45.926 A:middle
users want to see right on a

00:45:45.926 --> 00:45:47.146 A:middle
wrist raise, and the kind of

00:45:47.226 --> 00:45:49.566 A:middle
content that we are surfacing on

00:45:49.566 --> 00:45:50.646 A:middle
the Siri watch face, and trying

00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:52.066 A:middle
to promote to the top.

00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:55.946 A:middle
The richest experience happens

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.256 A:middle
when you have a watchOS app.

00:45:57.906 --> 00:45:59.206 A:middle
This is when the system can give

00:45:59.206 --> 00:46:00.396 A:middle
you additional background
