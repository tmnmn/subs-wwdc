00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:01.826 A:middle
is reinventing surgical care

00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:03.276 A:middle
using machine learning and

00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:04.976 A:middle
computer vision on iOS.

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:07.446 A:middle
And you've got to see this to

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.156 A:middle
believe it.

00:40:08.456 --> 00:40:09.396 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.186 A:middle
Here's Chris and Divia from our

00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:13.786 A:middle
Health Team to show you how it

00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:14.616 A:middle
works.

00:40:15.486 --> 00:40:17.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We love when teams tackle

00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:19.756 A:middle
huge problems in unique ways.

00:40:20.176 --> 00:40:21.936 A:middle
Especially, in healthcare.

00:40:22.616 --> 00:40:24.906 A:middle
Today, many clinicians have no

00:40:24.906 --> 00:40:26.416 A:middle
idea how to estimate how much

00:40:26.416 --> 00:40:28.296 A:middle
blood patients are losing in

00:40:28.296 --> 00:40:28.976 A:middle
procedures.

00:40:28.976 --> 00:40:31.376 A:middle
As a result, a lot of clinical

00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:32.846 A:middle
decisions are made based on

00:40:32.846 --> 00:40:34.886 A:middle
guesstimation, which can lead to

00:40:34.886 --> 00:40:36.806 A:middle
all sorts of complications.

00:40:37.446 --> 00:40:39.036 A:middle
Gauss Surgical is solving this

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.576 A:middle
problem using an iPad, machine

00:40:41.576 --> 00:40:43.216 A:middle
learning, and computer vision.

00:40:43.736 --> 00:40:45.256 A:middle
Before we show you a demo, I'd

00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.626 A:middle
like to introduce you to Chris

00:40:46.626 --> 00:40:47.976 A:middle
and the tools we'll be using.

00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:51.436 A:middle
We have an iPad Pro with an IR

00:40:51.436 --> 00:40:53.016 A:middle
sensor, and some surgical

00:40:53.016 --> 00:40:54.326 A:middle
sponges that are used in

00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:55.906 A:middle
operating rooms to soak up

00:40:55.906 --> 00:40:56.626 A:middle
blood.

00:40:57.176 --> 00:40:58.526 A:middle
Now, for the purposes of this

00:40:58.526 --> 00:40:59.956 A:middle
demo, we're going to mimic some

00:40:59.956 --> 00:41:01.926 A:middle
fake blood by using some red
