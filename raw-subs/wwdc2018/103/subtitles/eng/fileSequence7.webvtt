00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:01.226 A:middle
This chicken looks like she'll

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:01.836 A:middle
be a star.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.330 A:middle
Tap down here.

00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:08.466 A:middle
And I'm going to speed up her

00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:09.716 A:middle
tempo to match my buffalo bass.

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:13.176 A:middle
And, maybe, I'll do a call and

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:16.106 A:middle
response type thing so they can

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:17.676 A:middle
interact with each other.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.196 A:middle
Now, I need one more animal to

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:19.646 A:middle
spice things up.

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:20.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to tap here.

00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:22.656 A:middle
I happen to know there's a

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.666 A:middle
particularly funky jellyfish

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:24.806 A:middle
here.

00:07:24.996 --> 00:07:28.826 A:middle
So, let's give this one a go.

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:30.806 A:middle
Now, let's listen.

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:35.830 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:07:36.376 --> 00:07:36.816 A:middle
Sounds good.

00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:39.516 A:middle
So, as kids create these

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:40.686 A:middle
compositions they're building

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:41.746 A:middle
their sense of rhythm and

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:43.606 A:middle
musicality, very playfully and

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:45.086 A:middle
naturally, without need for any

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.096 A:middle
prior musical knowledge.

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:48.766 A:middle
And the beauty of the app is any

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.026 A:middle
combination of notes is going to

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:51.096 A:middle
sound good, because it's all

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.876 A:middle
playing in pentatonic scale.

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:54.416 A:middle
So, there's always a feeling of

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:55.096 A:middle
success.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.796 A:middle
Let's check out this percussion

00:07:56.796 --> 00:07:57.546 A:middle
section, up here.

00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:59.396 A:middle
So, I'm going to add some high

00:07:59.396 --> 00:07:59.826 A:middle
hat there.

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:02.216 A:middle
Layer in some snare drum and
