00:15:59.386 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
Ah. Again, we love this.

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
And you can, actually, listen to

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:04.506 A:middle
it, too, because it's available

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.286 A:middle
on iTunes and Apple Music.

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:09.316 A:middle
We, also, fell in love with how

00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:11.166 A:middle
it uses the haptic engine on our

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.356 A:middle
devices.

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.076 A:middle
So, Adrienne is getting a slight

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:16.036 A:middle
vibration on the iPhone when

00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:17.696 A:middle
she's, when she's landing a

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:20.316 A:middle
jump, performing a wall ride, or

00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:21.826 A:middle
even, bouncing off of hot air

00:16:21.826 --> 00:16:23.356 A:middle
balloons in the game.

00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:25.696 A:middle
It, also, maintains a super

00:16:25.796 --> 00:16:28.306 A:middle
smooth 60 frames per second on

00:16:28.376 --> 00:16:30.586 A:middle
every device, including previous

00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:31.526 A:middle
generation devices.

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:33.696 A:middle
In large part, thanks to Metal 2

00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:34.426 A:middle
and Unity.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.696 A:middle
And it even maintains that same

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:39.296 A:middle
simple control scheme across

00:16:39.946 --> 00:16:42.266 A:middle
iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

00:16:43.926 --> 00:16:46.796 A:middle
So, Alto's Odyssey is localized

00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:50.136 A:middle
into an incredible 20 languages,

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:53.306 A:middle
has over 2,000 4.5-star ratings

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:54.796 A:middle
since launching just over four

00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:55.396 A:middle
months, ago.

00:16:55.456 --> 00:16:57.616 A:middle
And is available only on the

00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:00.286 A:middle
iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.
