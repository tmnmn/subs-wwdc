00:44:59.536 --> 00:45:01.466 A:middle
job of bringing excitement with

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:03.736 A:middle
every new character, control,

00:45:03.736 --> 00:45:05.666 A:middle
and level, while introducing

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:07.186 A:middle
these at a pace that allows the

00:45:07.266 --> 00:45:08.176 A:middle
players to master it.

00:45:09.556 --> 00:45:11.656 A:middle
The soundtrack influenced by the

00:45:11.736 --> 00:45:13.266 A:middle
traditional Swedish folk music

00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:17.156 A:middle
really gives the game its Nordic

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.716 A:middle
Viking setting at every level.

00:45:19.866 --> 00:45:21.926 A:middle
It was recorded at a studio in a

00:45:21.926 --> 00:45:23.296 A:middle
small village deep in the

00:45:23.376 --> 00:45:25.000 A:middle
forests of southern Sweden.

00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:27.876 A:middle
So, every aspect of the game,

00:45:28.206 --> 00:45:30.516 A:middle
from level design to story to

00:45:30.516 --> 00:45:32.116 A:middle
music was made with great

00:45:32.306 --> 00:45:33.566 A:middle
effort, dedication to detail,

00:45:33.656 --> 00:45:34.536 A:middle
and craft.

00:45:35.386 --> 00:45:37.256 A:middle
As visually stunning as it is

00:45:37.476 --> 00:45:38.556 A:middle
with the level of detail and

00:45:38.626 --> 00:45:40.416 A:middle
artwork, Oddmar calls for a

00:45:40.416 --> 00:45:42.636 A:middle
larger screenplay and we think

00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:44.046 A:middle
you will love it on iPad Pro.

00:45:45.136 --> 00:45:46.496 A:middle
It supports the use of game

00:45:46.496 --> 00:45:48.416 A:middle
controllers, allows you to play

00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:50.546 A:middle
and sync on multiple devices by

00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:51.476 A:middle
saving on iCloud.

00:45:52.746 --> 00:45:54.596 A:middle
Oddmar benefits from using Metal

00:45:54.856 --> 00:45:56.646 A:middle
to create this visually stunning

00:45:56.646 --> 00:45:58.416 A:middle
and fluid gameplay experience.

00:45:59.106 --> 00:45:59.846 A:middle
It uses only [inaudible]
