00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
tonight.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:04.506 A:middle
To honor and celebrate that hard

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:05.286 A:middle
work.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:07.676 A:middle
Today's winners set a new

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.976 A:middle
benchmark in creativity and they

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:11.356 A:middle
demonstrate the mark of

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:13.416 A:middle
brilliance that makes something

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:14.036 A:middle
truly great.

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:18.315 A:middle
Okay. We've got something to do

00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.466 A:middle
here, tonight, which is to give

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:20.646 A:middle
out a bunch of awards.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.406 A:middle
And we're going to do that in a

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:23.536 A:middle
very large room.

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:25.686 A:middle
So, if you hear your name

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:27.766 A:middle
called, if you hear your app's

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.946 A:middle
name called, you need to make it

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:30.746 A:middle
up here fast.

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:32.746 A:middle
Because we want to move this

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.746 A:middle
along and it's a big room.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:36.676 A:middle
There are two sets of stairs

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:37.806 A:middle
here on either side of me.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:40.086 A:middle
So, just head towards me, you'll

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.186 A:middle
find a set of stairs, you'll

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:42.236 A:middle
make it onto the stage, and

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.886 A:middle
we'll move on from there.

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.496 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:50.206 A:middle
Identifying the audience for

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.916 A:middle
your app and developing

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.426 A:middle
something that's perfectly

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:56.566 A:middle
suited for them and their needs

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.116 A:middle
is really important.

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:00.736 A:middle
The developer of our first
