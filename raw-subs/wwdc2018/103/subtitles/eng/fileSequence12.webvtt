00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:00.586 A:middle
I wanted.

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:03.296 A:middle
So, you can imagine after using

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:05.656 A:middle
this for a couple weeks, you end

00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:06.546 A:middle
up with this really great

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:08.226 A:middle
integration with Calendar and

00:12:08.226 --> 00:12:08.596 A:middle
Agenda.

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:09.926 A:middle
And it keeps you super

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:10.366 A:middle
organized.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:15.036 A:middle
Lastly, because I know I'm going

00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:16.816 A:middle
to be doing a lot of HealthKit

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.506 A:middle
talking this week, I'm going to

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:19.636 A:middle
search for all my HealthKit

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:20.516 A:middle
related events.

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.146 A:middle
And I can save this as an

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:23.676 A:middle
overview.

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:24.876 A:middle
And what this does, it creates

00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:25.976 A:middle
this nice little pocket here,

00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:26.896 A:middle
where everything HealthKit

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:27.976 A:middle
related is in one spot.

00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:29.226 A:middle
Super convenient.

00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:31.826 A:middle
The entire app is created in

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:33.566 A:middle
Swift and it leverages iCloud,

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:35.236 A:middle
so it syncs across all of my

00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:35.726 A:middle
devices.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.566 A:middle
Agenda is not simply a place to

00:12:37.566 --> 00:12:38.036 A:middle
store text.

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:39.636 A:middle
Rather, a tool that gently

00:12:39.636 --> 00:12:41.316 A:middle
reinforces great note taking

00:12:41.316 --> 00:12:41.626 A:middle
habits.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.796 A:middle
Agenda is, also, available on

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.566 A:middle
iOS and makes a great addition

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:46.746 A:middle
to your productivity arsenal.

00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:47.626 A:middle
Thank you.

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:48.686 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:12:49.516 --> 00:12:54.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:57.146 --> 00:12:58.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chris.

00:12:59.116 --> 00:13:01.906 A:middle
Great apps always leave a strong
