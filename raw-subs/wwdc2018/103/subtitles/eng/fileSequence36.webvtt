00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926 A:middle
Interactions are so simple and

00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:02.826 A:middle
intuitive and natural.

00:36:03.406 --> 00:36:06.076 A:middle
And just behold how graceful and

00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:08.056 A:middle
beautiful the swarm is, just

00:36:08.056 --> 00:36:08.996 A:middle
with a little bit of

00:36:08.996 --> 00:36:10.076 A:middle
interaction.

00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:11.606 A:middle
It's really pretty.

00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:13.896 A:middle
Now, it seems here that the

00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:16.476 A:middle
objective it to try to take some

00:36:16.476 --> 00:36:17.636 A:middle
of the blue creatures to one

00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:19.136 A:middle
planet and some to the other.

00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:21.666 A:middle
So, to start over I simply tap

00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:22.906 A:middle
anywhere on the screen.

00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:25.676 A:middle
And using multitouch I can draw

00:36:25.676 --> 00:36:27.526 A:middle
two paths to each planet.

00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:29.846 A:middle
Now, when those yellow rings

00:36:29.966 --> 00:36:31.796 A:middle
fill, that's when I know how

00:36:31.796 --> 00:36:33.286 A:middle
many creatures each planet has

00:36:33.516 --> 00:36:34.036 A:middle
to hold.

00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:35.386 A:middle
Little bit more.

00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:37.956 A:middle
And once it fills all the way,

00:36:38.276 --> 00:36:39.776 A:middle
this really beautiful animation

00:36:39.936 --> 00:36:41.126 A:middle
plays to let me know that the

00:36:41.126 --> 00:36:42.246 A:middle
level is complete.

00:36:42.246 --> 00:36:43.756 A:middle
And on iPhone, they use haptics

00:36:43.926 --> 00:36:46.306 A:middle
to punctuate that animation and

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:47.566 A:middle
other special moments.

00:36:47.626 --> 00:36:50.276 A:middle
Now, every level in Frost is a

00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:51.626 A:middle
work of art.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.646 A:middle
But I want to skip ahead here to

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.386 A:middle
a more advanced level and go

00:36:55.386 --> 00:36:58.476 A:middle
from number 4 to number 24.

00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.876 A:middle
Now, as we progress through the
