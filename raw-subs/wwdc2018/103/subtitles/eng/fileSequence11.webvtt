00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
my prior notes attached before I

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:01.636 A:middle
make that phone call.

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:03.726 A:middle
What makes this app really great

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:04.656 A:middle
is its integration with

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:05.176 A:middle
Calendar.

00:11:05.746 --> 00:11:06.796 A:middle
So, on the right-hand side here,

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:08.526 A:middle
you can see all my Calendar

00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:08.776 A:middle
events.

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:11.106 A:middle
There's a HealthKit lab tomorrow

00:11:11.106 --> 00:11:12.566 A:middle
and I need to remember to note

00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:13.466 A:middle
down a couple of questions.

00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:14.386 A:middle
So, we'll do that together.

00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:16.816 A:middle
So, I bring in this note.

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:18.686 A:middle
You can see it brings in all the

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:19.776 A:middle
details from Calendar.

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.766 A:middle
So, the event details, the

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:23.826 A:middle
location, the attendees.

00:11:23.826 --> 00:11:25.186 A:middle
So, I can focus on creating the

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:25.326 A:middle
note.

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:28.326 A:middle
So, as I create this note, you

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:29.946 A:middle
can see the app supports

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:30.546 A:middle
markdown.

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:33.636 A:middle
It also supports tagging, which

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:34.066 A:middle
is really nice.

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:34.806 A:middle
So, I'm going to tag this as a

00:11:34.806 --> 00:11:35.736 A:middle
HealthKit related note.

00:11:36.546 --> 00:11:37.646 A:middle
As I'm making this note, I

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:39.616 A:middle
realize a colleague and I had a

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.686 A:middle
meeting a couple weeks back,

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:41.566 A:middle
where we brainstormed some

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:42.596 A:middle
HealthKit related questions.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:43.806 A:middle
So, I'm going to swing over to

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.286 A:middle
Calendar and find that meeting.

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:50.046 A:middle
This meeting with John.

00:11:50.246 --> 00:11:53.006 A:middle
Agenda provides this link in the

00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:54.756 A:middle
Calendar in my, so as I click on

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.056 A:middle
this it clicks me right back

00:11:56.096 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
into this meeting with John.

00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.666 A:middle
And here are the questions that

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:00.586 A:middle
I wanted.
