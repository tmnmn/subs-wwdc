So, Florence is a beautiful

00:27:11.686 --> 00:27:14.116 A:middle
cinematic story in which you get

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:15.606 A:middle
to experience the impact of

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:18.136 A:middle
decisions and emotions of adult

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:19.826 A:middle
life and first love.

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:21.766 A:middle
Let's take a look.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:29.746 A:middle
I really enjoy playing Florence,

00:27:30.306 --> 00:27:32.436 A:middle
because it is just so compelling

00:27:32.696 --> 00:27:33.326 A:middle
and approachable.

00:27:33.876 --> 00:27:35.046 A:middle
And it's really personal,

00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:37.056 A:middle
because you hold the story of

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:38.886 A:middle
Florence in your hand and use

00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:40.306 A:middle
really familiar controls to

00:27:40.306 --> 00:27:40.636 A:middle
play.

00:27:40.636 --> 00:27:42.746 A:middle
Through beautiful illustrations,

00:27:43.136 --> 00:27:45.036 A:middle
soundtracks, and haptics, you

00:27:45.076 --> 00:27:46.776 A:middle
experience life as Florence.

00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:49.466 A:middle
In this scene it's all about

00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:50.026 A:middle
adult life.

00:27:50.266 --> 00:27:52.406 A:middle
And this game helps you realize

00:27:52.526 --> 00:27:54.136 A:middle
that we're all just trying to

00:27:54.136 --> 00:27:55.446 A:middle
get through our day, to get back

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:56.666 A:middle
to the things that we really

00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:57.136 A:middle
care about.

00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:59.936 A:middle
Another part of adult life, as
