spotlights provide some respite,

00:25:00.506 --> 00:25:04.766 A:middle
but you're never safe for long.

00:25:05.526 --> 00:25:06.686 A:middle
iCloud, actually, allows you to

00:25:06.746 --> 00:25:07.766 A:middle
save your progress across

00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:09.506 A:middle
devices, so you can pick back up

00:25:09.546 --> 00:25:10.396 A:middle
where you left off, whether

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:11.516 A:middle
you're playing on the iPad,

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:15.856 A:middle
much of the game for you, but

there's one more scene I want to

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:17.226 A:middle
show.

00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:19.286 A:middle
And fair warning; it's a little

00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:19.536 A:middle
intense.

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:20.686 A:middle
