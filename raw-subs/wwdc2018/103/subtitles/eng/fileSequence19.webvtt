What would Arnold say to you,

00:19:01.956 --> 00:19:02.936 A:middle
today?

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:03.456 A:middle
[German language] Ich komme

00:19:03.946 --> 00:19:04.076 A:middle
wieder.

00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:05.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'll be back.

00:19:06.976 --> 00:19:07.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But for the purpose of this

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.176 A:middle
demo, we're going to pick

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:13.826 A:middle
Chinese Mandarin.

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:17.196 A:middle
Now, as you can see, the whole

00:19:17.196 --> 00:19:18.406 A:middle
screen of the app turns into a

00:19:18.406 --> 00:19:19.296 A:middle
tappable area.

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:21.986 A:middle
But the developer went one step

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:24.586 A:middle
further by implementing 3D touch

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:25.836 A:middle
and haptic feedback.

00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:27.656 A:middle
So, you can use the app without

00:19:27.656 --> 00:19:28.826 A:middle
even looking at the screen.

00:19:29.706 --> 00:19:31.416 A:middle
Now, let's imaging I have just

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:34.446 A:middle
landed in Beijing and I'm

00:19:35.006 --> 00:19:36.766 A:middle
meeting my colleague, Carol.

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.146 A:middle
And I'm super hungry but I don't

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:40.496 A:middle
speak a single word of Chinese.

00:19:41.116 --> 00:19:44.016 A:middle
So, Carol, do you know where to

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.316 A:middle
have spaghetti?

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:53.500 A:middle
[ Chinese Language ]

00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:56.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Why do you want to eat

00:19:56.956 --> 00:19:57.976 A:middle
spaghetti in Beijing?
