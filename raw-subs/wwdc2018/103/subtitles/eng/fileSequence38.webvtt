00:38:00.616 --> 00:38:01.846 A:middle
But, not me.

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:02.486 A:middle
I like winning.

00:38:02.996 --> 00:38:04.896 A:middle
So, I'm going to try to get the

00:38:04.946 --> 00:38:07.276 A:middle
red creatures to move around,

00:38:07.346 --> 00:38:08.586 A:middle
pick up the blue creatures who

00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:10.306 A:middle
might give a lift to the yellow

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:10.786 A:middle
creatures.

00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:12.296 A:middle
And help them find their way

00:38:12.296 --> 00:38:12.586 A:middle
home.

00:38:13.246 --> 00:38:14.516 A:middle
It's a crazy enough plan that I

00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:15.596 A:middle
think it just might work.

00:38:16.676 --> 00:38:18.536 A:middle
Now, Frost offers hours and

00:38:18.536 --> 00:38:20.136 A:middle
hours of gameplay.

00:38:20.896 --> 00:38:22.326 A:middle
And the sheer beauty of watching

00:38:22.436 --> 00:38:23.896 A:middle
thousands of individually

00:38:23.896 --> 00:38:25.666 A:middle
animating creatures move around

00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:28.036 A:middle
your iPhone or iPad is really

00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:28.756 A:middle
breathtaking.

00:38:29.726 --> 00:38:32.756 A:middle
Now, in order to power this real

00:38:32.756 --> 00:38:34.606 A:middle
time simulation, they needed

00:38:34.606 --> 00:38:35.766 A:middle
Metal on iOS.

00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:37.686 A:middle
It's the only consumer mobile

00:38:37.686 --> 00:38:38.846 A:middle
device which has the

00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:41.406 A:middle
computational power needed to

00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:42.786 A:middle
render these complex

00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:44.836 A:middle
programmatic animations.

00:38:46.046 --> 00:38:47.476 A:middle
But the thing that I love most

00:38:47.866 --> 00:38:50.526 A:middle
about Frost is how anyone can

00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:51.916 A:middle
play this game, regardless of

00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:54.216 A:middle
their age or where they live or

00:38:54.516 --> 00:38:55.676 A:middle
what language they speak.

00:38:55.986 --> 00:38:57.856 A:middle
It can be a delightful, calming,

00:38:57.856 --> 00:38:59.176 A:middle
and engaging experience.
