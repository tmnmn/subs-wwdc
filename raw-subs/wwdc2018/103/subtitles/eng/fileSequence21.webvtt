use the app even without your

00:21:01.366 --> 00:21:01.716 A:middle
iPhone.

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:04.516 A:middle
Now, let me finish by saying

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:06.526 A:middle

That's awesome.

00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:43.216 A:middle
That's an app that can break

00:21:43.216 --> 00:21:45.086 A:middle
down barriers and help us build

00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:46.376 A:middle
meaningful relationships with

00:21:46.436 --> 00:21:49.056 A:middle

00:21:54.066 --> 00:21:55.086 A:middle
looking for apps that are

00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:57.266 A:middle
incredibly well designed, that

00:21:57.266 --> 00:21:58.956 A:middle
are innovative, and they're

00:21:58.956 --> 00:22:00.526 A:middle
optimized for our devices.
