00:28:00.016 --> 00:28:02.646 A:middle
well; getting calls from Mom.

00:28:03.226 --> 00:28:04.576 A:middle
And this part of the game was

00:28:04.576 --> 00:28:05.766 A:middle
just too real for me.

00:28:05.766 --> 00:28:07.556 A:middle
It's like, ''Hi, Mom.

00:28:08.046 --> 00:28:09.376 A:middle
No, I don't need any help

00:28:09.376 --> 00:28:10.346 A:middle
finding a boyfriend.

00:28:10.716 --> 00:28:12.846 A:middle
And yes, work is going just

00:28:12.846 --> 00:28:13.436 A:middle
fine.''

00:28:13.436 --> 00:28:15.616 A:middle
So, with the help of TC, who's

00:28:15.656 --> 00:28:17.646 A:middle
doing a great job demoing today,

00:28:17.966 --> 00:28:19.036 A:middle
we're going to take a look at

00:28:19.236 --> 00:28:21.436 A:middle
another scene.

00:28:21.716 --> 00:28:24.026 A:middle
Florence has a custom composed

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:26.986 A:middle
soundtrack and it's incredible.

00:28:27.546 --> 00:28:29.636 A:middle
Music plays a huge part

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:30.436 A:middle
throughout the entire

00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:31.686 A:middle
experience.

00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:34.466 A:middle
And this is when you hear music

00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:35.996 A:middle
and you decide to tap the notes

00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:37.246 A:middle
to follow it.

00:28:37.476 --> 00:28:39.656 A:middle
And you know how music can make

00:28:39.726 --> 00:28:42.176 A:middle
you feel, how it can just lift

00:28:42.176 --> 00:28:42.846 A:middle
you up.

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.396 A:middle
Well, it also can lead to a

00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:46.526 A:middle
really great story.

00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:48.796 A:middle
Through beautiful fades,

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:50.136 A:middle
transitions, and soundtrack,

00:28:50.746 --> 00:28:52.846 A:middle
this plays just like a great

00:28:52.846 --> 00:28:53.396 A:middle
movie.

00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:55.616 A:middle
And the camera holds on moments

00:28:55.616 --> 00:28:57.196 A:middle
that mean just a little bit

00:28:57.336 --> 00:28:57.506 A:middle
more.

00:28:57.766 --> 00:28:59.966 A:middle
And this well-designed subtlety,
