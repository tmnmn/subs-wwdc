00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.496 A:middle
This is an app that we fell in

00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:03.376 A:middle
love with, just like we did with

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:04.266 A:middle
its predecessor.

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.266 A:middle
Snowman and Team Alto have done

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:09.006 A:middle
an incredible job of taking what

00:14:09.006 --> 00:14:10.216 A:middle
people love from Alto's

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.386 A:middle
Adventure and improving on it in

00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:14.296 A:middle
every way for Odyssey.

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:15.856 A:middle
And I'd like to ask my

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.796 A:middle
colleagues, Adrienne and Jordan,

00:14:17.796 --> 00:14:18.976 A:middle
to show it to us, now.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:25.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.446 A:middle
Alto's Odyssey is an endless

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:31.326 A:middle
sandboarding game, where you

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:33.656 A:middle
ride through sunswept dunes,

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:36.046 A:middle
perform midair stunts, all while

00:14:36.046 --> 00:14:37.966 A:middle
completing fun challenges and

00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:39.246 A:middle
unlocking new characters.

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:40.966 A:middle
So, my colleague Adrienne will

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:41.946 A:middle
be joining us for the demo,

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:42.316 A:middle
today.

00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:43.416 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:46.806 A:middle
The first thing that we loved

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:48.646 A:middle
about Alto's Odyssey was that it

00:14:48.696 --> 00:14:49.756 A:middle
provides the user with

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:52.436 A:middle
contextual clues and elegantly

00:14:52.596 --> 00:14:54.516 A:middle
pauses the game, so the player

00:14:54.616 --> 00:14:56.436 A:middle
learns by playing.

00:14:56.436 --> 00:14:57.576 A:middle
So, here she's getting taught

00:14:57.686 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
how to perform a wall ride,

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.016 A:middle
which is a new feature in the
