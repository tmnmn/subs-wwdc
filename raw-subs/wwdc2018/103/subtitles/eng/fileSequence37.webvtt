00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.876 A:middle
Now, as we progress through the

00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:03.006 A:middle
game we're introduced to new

00:37:03.006 --> 00:37:04.566 A:middle
creative challenges along the

00:37:04.566 --> 00:37:05.296 A:middle
way.

00:37:05.296 --> 00:37:07.656 A:middle
But also, new species with

00:37:07.656 --> 00:37:08.896 A:middle
different types of swarming

00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:09.476 A:middle
behaviors.

00:37:09.516 --> 00:37:11.656 A:middle
So, on this level we have yellow

00:37:11.656 --> 00:37:13.736 A:middle
creatures and blue and red.

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:15.156 A:middle
And it seems, here, that my

00:37:15.156 --> 00:37:16.426 A:middle
objective is to help the yellow

00:37:16.426 --> 00:37:17.446 A:middle
creatures get to the yellow

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:17.886 A:middle
planet.

00:37:18.346 --> 00:37:19.516 A:middle
So, I just make a beeline from

00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:20.416 A:middle
one place to another, but

00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.776 A:middle
they're not responding.

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:23.316 A:middle
Blue ones don't really do

00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:24.256 A:middle
anything, either.

00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:26.646 A:middle
Maybe, if I bring the red ones

00:37:26.646 --> 00:37:28.676 A:middle
over here it'll do something.

00:37:28.676 --> 00:37:29.786 A:middle
Oh, we can see those blue

00:37:29.786 --> 00:37:31.096 A:middle
creatures really scattered.

00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:32.956 A:middle
Now, what I want to do is just

00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:34.466 A:middle
pause here, for a second, and

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:37.196 A:middle
just kind of enjoy this moment

00:37:37.196 --> 00:37:38.506 A:middle
that Frost creates for us.

00:37:39.086 --> 00:37:40.766 A:middle
The mood that it sets is so

00:37:41.086 --> 00:37:42.906 A:middle
ethereal, it's so soothing and

00:37:42.906 --> 00:37:43.646 A:middle
so tranquil.

00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:45.246 A:middle
Watching these creatures move

00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:47.166 A:middle
around is really mesmerizing and

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:48.116 A:middle
kind of hypnotic.

00:37:48.846 --> 00:37:50.076 A:middle
A lot of players will, actually,

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:53.436 A:middle
just kind of stop and enjoy this

00:37:53.476 --> 00:37:55.206 A:middle
experience and experiment and

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.356 A:middle
observe how the creatures

00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:58.426 A:middle
respond to touch, and really

00:37:58.526 --> 00:37:59.056 A:middle
soak it in.
