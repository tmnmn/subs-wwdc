So, again, congratulations to

00:17:02.216 --> 00:17:02.816 A:middle
the team.

00:17:02.816 --> 00:17:03.556 A:middle
And back to you, John.

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:04.346 A:middle
Great going, guys.

Now, talking about localization,

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:18.076 A:middle
localizing your app so that it's

00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:19.356 A:middle
available to people around the

00:17:19.356 --> 00:17:20.536 A:middle
world in their language of

00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:22.715 A:middle
choice is really important.

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:23.935 A:middle
And it's something that we talk

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:25.016 A:middle
about a lot, here at Apple.

00:17:25.016 --> 00:17:26.685 A:middle
And we encourage you to do.

00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:28.886 A:middle
But making an app that helps

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:30.606 A:middle
people converse with others

00:17:30.956 --> 00:17:32.396 A:middle
whose language they don't speak

00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:33.986 A:middle
is a big deal.

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:36.626 A:middle
Our next winner is an app that's

00:17:36.626 --> 00:17:38.896 A:middle
been downloaded more than 80

00:17:38.896 --> 00:17:39.966 A:middle
million times.
