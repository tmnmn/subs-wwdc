00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:02.266 A:middle
paltry .06 gigatons.

00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:04.096 A:middle
Now, if you notice that you've

00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:05.426 A:middle
made a mistake, all you have to

00:33:05.426 --> 00:33:07.776 A:middle
do is go into the expression, 3D

00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:09.356 A:middle
Touch on the operator, put the

00:33:09.356 --> 00:33:10.146 A:middle
correct one in.

00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:12.016 A:middle
And this way, you can see that

00:33:12.016 --> 00:33:13.386 A:middle
the weight of tall bacteria is

00:33:13.386 --> 00:33:15.276 A:middle
about 1,200 times greater than

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.376 A:middle
the weight of all people.

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:17.736 A:middle
That's a lot of bacteria.

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:18.786 A:middle
So, wash your hands before

00:33:18.786 --> 00:33:19.716 A:middle
dinner tonight, folks.

00:33:20.736 --> 00:33:22.556 A:middle
There's a lot more great things

00:33:22.556 --> 00:33:23.586 A:middle
Calzy can do that we don't have

00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:24.486 A:middle
a whole lot of time for.

00:33:24.486 --> 00:33:25.676 A:middle
But it's got support for things

00:33:25.676 --> 00:33:27.886 A:middle
like Handoff and iCloud Sync,

00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:30.166 A:middle
even Face ID, Touch ID

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:32.236 A:middle
protection for the bookmarks,

00:33:32.236 --> 00:33:32.806 A:middle
Drag and Drop.

00:33:32.806 --> 00:33:33.796 A:middle
Whole bunch of great things.

00:33:33.846 --> 00:33:34.756 A:middle
Go ahead and check it out in the

00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:35.326 A:middle
App Store.

00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:37.086 A:middle
But before we go, a quick note

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:38.806 A:middle
about the inspirational story of

00:33:38.806 --> 00:33:39.906 A:middle
the developer behind it.

00:33:40.696 --> 00:33:42.036 A:middle
Gentleman from a small village

00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:43.616 A:middle
in India working as a visual

00:33:43.616 --> 00:33:45.086 A:middle
effects artist who decided he

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:46.706 A:middle
wanted to harness his creativity

00:33:46.706 --> 00:33:47.606 A:middle
in a different way.

00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:49.716 A:middle
So, he taught himself Swift, as

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:50.096 A:middle
you do.

00:33:50.366 --> 00:33:51.716 A:middle
And within just a few months,

00:33:51.836 --> 00:33:53.336 A:middle
was creating great iPhone apps,

00:33:53.506 --> 00:33:54.606 A:middle
including Calzy.

00:33:55.056 --> 00:33:56.076 A:middle
Congratulations, Raja.

00:33:56.156 --> 00:33:56.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:33:57.516 --> 00:34:03.500 A:middle
