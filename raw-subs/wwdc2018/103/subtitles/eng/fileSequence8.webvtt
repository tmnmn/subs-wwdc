Layer in some snare drum and

00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:03.326 A:middle
some more percussion, here.

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:07.326 A:middle
And lastly, my bass drum.

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.206 A:middle
All of these sounds, percussion

00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:11.456 A:middle
and animals, were recorded in

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:12.596 A:middle
the studio using real

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:13.856 A:middle
instruments to get the music and

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.336 A:middle
natural sounds.

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.266 A:middle
I can even add a sound effect by

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:20.176 A:middle
tapping on these mountains.

00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
That's going to give my chicken

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.106 A:middle
an echo.

00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:23.786 A:middle
So, let's check out this

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:24.936 A:middle
reverberating chicken.

00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:31.826 A:middle
So, you can see there's all

00:08:31.826 --> 00:08:32.866 A:middle
sorts of fun to be had with

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:33.726 A:middle
sound in this app.

00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:35.265 A:middle
And it's a great way for kids to

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.806 A:middle
get creative with music and feel

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:38.976 A:middle
their ear and their intuition

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:40.456 A:middle
for the rhythms and sounds that

00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:41.736 A:middle
they like to hear together.

00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:43.816 A:middle
The Yatatoy team of three spent

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.126 A:middle
two years developing this app

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:46.546 A:middle
using Swift, Sprite Kit, and

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:47.306 A:middle
Core Audio.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:48.836 A:middle
They were working remotely

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:50.066 A:middle
between Helsinki and Vienna.

00:08:50.656 --> 00:08:51.706 A:middle
And they were doing this in the

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:53.336 A:middle
afterhours from their day jobs.

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:54.646 A:middle
It's all culminated in an app

00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:55.786 A:middle
that's really magical.

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.816 A:middle
So, congratulations.
