00:24:15.336 --> 00:24:16.356 A:middle
With no onboarding at the

00:24:16.356 --> 00:24:17.816 A:middle
beginning and no loading screen

00:24:17.816 --> 00:24:19.896 A:middle
in the middle, INSIDE is both

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:21.246 A:middle
intuitive and immersive.

00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:25.466 A:middle
Using Unity, Metal, and a custom

00:24:25.466 --> 00:24:26.926 A:middle
temporal reprojection filter,

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:28.446 A:middle
Playdead's crafted this

00:24:28.536 --> 00:24:30.086 A:middle
distinctly surreal environment

00:24:30.446 --> 00:24:31.846 A:middle
and console quality graphics.

00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:34.256 A:middle
They actually fully support HDR

00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:35.826 A:middle
on both the iPhone 10 and the

00:24:35.826 --> 00:24:36.766 A:middle
iPad.

00:24:37.546 --> 00:24:38.776 A:middle
So, that makes dark scenes like

00:24:38.836 --> 00:24:40.386 A:middle
this seem really crisp and

00:24:40.386 --> 00:24:40.766 A:middle
clear.

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:43.656 A:middle
Now, light plays an important

00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:45.406 A:middle
role on INSIDE, and roving

00:24:45.406 --> 00:24:46.316 A:middle
spotlights are, often, your

00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:46.696 A:middle
enemies.

00:24:47.426 --> 00:24:49.066 A:middle
But, in this case, Adrienne has

00:24:49.186 --> 00:24:50.516 A:middle
to, actually, turn the lights on

00:24:50.566 --> 00:24:52.356 A:middle
in order to power that elevator

00:24:52.356 --> 00:24:53.000 A:middle
at the end of the hallway.

00:24:57.066 --> 00:24:58.616 A:middle

spotlights provide some respite,
