00:40:59.956 --> 00:41:01.926 A:middle
fake blood by using some red

00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:02.876 A:middle
food coloring.

00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:04.986 A:middle
But if you start to feel queasy,

00:41:04.986 --> 00:41:07.066 A:middle
at all, please avert your eyes

00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:08.156 A:middle
for just a moment.

00:41:09.256 --> 00:41:11.556 A:middle
Gauss' app is super simple to

00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:11.916 A:middle
use.

00:41:12.426 --> 00:41:14.036 A:middle
All you have to do is hold up a

00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:15.286 A:middle
sponge in front of the camera.

00:41:16.316 --> 00:41:18.696 A:middle
From there, Gauss uses Core ML

00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:20.446 A:middle
to detect the sponge using the

00:41:20.446 --> 00:41:21.836 A:middle
camera and IR sensor.

00:41:22.466 --> 00:41:23.616 A:middle
They've then developed some

00:41:23.706 --> 00:41:24.896 A:middle
custom machine learning

00:41:24.896 --> 00:41:27.166 A:middle
algorithms to analyze the red

00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:28.806 A:middle
spots of blood and, actually,

00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.086 A:middle
calculate blood loss.

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:31.536 A:middle
It's amazing.

00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:34.386 A:middle
Gauss' app is FDA approved and

00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:36.026 A:middle
HIPAA compliant.

00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:38.986 A:middle
But now, let's see if it's hippo

00:41:38.986 --> 00:41:39.616 A:middle
compliant.

00:41:39.616 --> 00:41:42.536 A:middle
As you can imagine.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:44.766 A:middle
As you can imagine, it's

00:41:44.766 --> 00:41:46.156 A:middle
incredibly important in an

00:41:46.156 --> 00:41:47.946 A:middle
operating room to make sure you

00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:49.516 A:middle
don't accidentally double count

00:41:49.516 --> 00:41:50.096 A:middle
a sponge.

00:41:50.636 --> 00:41:52.376 A:middle
So, if Chris hold up the hippo

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.896 A:middle
sponge one more time, even if in

00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:57.366 A:middle
a different orientation, Gauss'

00:41:57.566 --> 00:42:00.156 A:middle
app is able to detect that it's
