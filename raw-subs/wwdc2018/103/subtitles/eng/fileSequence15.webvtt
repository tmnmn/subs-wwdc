00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.016 A:middle
which is a new feature in the

00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
game.

00:15:01.336 --> 00:15:02.716 A:middle
There are no carousels that

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:03.966 A:middle
she's swiping through.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.996 A:middle
It's just her and the game.

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:08.536 A:middle
We, also, love that it maintains

00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:10.406 A:middle
that same simple control scheme

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:12.316 A:middle
for Alto's Adventure but ramps

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.666 A:middle
up the difficulty with new

00:15:13.756 --> 00:15:14.216 A:middle
challenges.

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:16.816 A:middle
Control-wise, all Adrienne is

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.776 A:middle
doing is tapping to jump, and

00:15:18.776 --> 00:15:20.046 A:middle
then tapping and holding to

00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:22.116 A:middle
perform some epic flips.

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:25.416 A:middle
Now, Alto's Odyssey is a real

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:26.956 A:middle
feast for the senses.

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:29.476 A:middle
Visually, there's so much to

00:15:29.516 --> 00:15:30.476 A:middle
look at in this game.

00:15:31.156 --> 00:15:32.116 A:middle
There is elements in the

00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:33.256 A:middle
foreground, in the background

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.676 A:middle
like hot air balloons, sand

00:15:35.676 --> 00:15:36.546 A:middle
coming off the back of the

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:36.976 A:middle
board.

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:39.706 A:middle
But each level has such a

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.336 A:middle
striking color palette to it

00:15:41.336 --> 00:15:42.866 A:middle
that we fell in love with.

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:45.236 A:middle
That same attention to detail,

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.086 A:middle
also, carries over into the

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:47.896 A:middle
audio, as well.

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:49.426 A:middle
So, actually, let's take a

00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:50.326 A:middle
listen to that, right now.

00:15:51.516 --> 00:15:58.500 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:15:59.386 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
Ah. Again, we love this.
