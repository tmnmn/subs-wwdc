Oddmar was developed by a team,

00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:20.226 A:middle
a small team of four, two of

00:43:20.226 --> 00:43:22.156 A:middle
whom are here, at a university

00:43:22.156 --> 00:43:23.906 A:middle
in Turkey, which goes to show

00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:25.296 A:middle
that great games don't always

00:43:25.326 --> 00:43:26.306 A:middle
come from the places that you

00:43:26.306 --> 00:43:26.846 A:middle
would expect.

00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:29.406 A:middle
We've had a blast with this game

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.906 A:middle
and we think you will, too.

00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:32.386 A:middle
We'd like to show it to you,

00:43:32.386 --> 00:43:32.656 A:middle
now.

Oddmar is a gorgeous

00:43:42.076 --> 00:43:44.046 A:middle
action-adventure platformer that

00:43:44.046 --> 00:43:45.856 A:middle
is beautiful, charming, and

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:46.366 A:middle
humorous.

00:43:46.846 --> 00:43:48.606 A:middle
Let us introduce you to Oddmar

00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:50.826 A:middle
and our not so successful Viking

00:43:50.826 --> 00:43:52.356 A:middle
hero on the journey to prove

00:43:52.356 --> 00:43:53.976 A:middle
himself worthy of Valhalla.

00:43:56.686 --> 00:43:57.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The onboarding is smooth and

00:43:57.656 --> 00:43:59.276 A:middle
the controls are easy to use
