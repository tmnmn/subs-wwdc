[ Music ]

00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.016 A:middle
So, Agenda takes a clever new

00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:12.656 A:middle
approach to note taking on the

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:14.886 A:middle
Mac and now, on iOS, as well.

00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:17.216 A:middle
By combining notes, calendars,

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:19.656 A:middle
and tasks in unique ways and

00:10:19.656 --> 00:10:20.556 A:middle
with really powerful

00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:21.326 A:middle
relationships.

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:23.606 A:middle
And as well, it's got a great

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:24.616 A:middle
clean design.

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:26.236 A:middle
And we'd like to show it to you,

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:26.466 A:middle
now.

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:27.586 A:middle
So, I'm going to hand it over to

00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:27.846 A:middle
Chris.

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:31.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Agenda is a simple and fresh

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:32.346 A:middle
way to keep yourself organized.

00:10:32.786 --> 00:10:34.456 A:middle
It combines a To-Do list and a

00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:35.826 A:middle
note taking app with a

00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:37.776 A:middle
delightful calendar integration.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:38.706 A:middle
Let me show you what I mean.

00:10:39.336 --> 00:10:40.676 A:middle
We start out with On the Agenda.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:41.996 A:middle
This is a task manager like

00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:42.506 A:middle
experience.

00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:44.206 A:middle
I can quickly see my highest

00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:45.846 A:middle
priority items and what I need

00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:47.596 A:middle
to do with all my prior notes

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:47.966 A:middle
attached.

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:49.326 A:middle
I can mark things off as I

00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:49.836 A:middle
complete them.

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:50.746 A:middle
So, now that we're done with

00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:52.036 A:middle
Keynote, let's get that off.

00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:53.096 A:middle
And State of the Union.

00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:54.506 A:middle
Actually, in the midst of a

00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:55.666 A:middle
house renovation, so I need to

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:56.996 A:middle
remember to call the contractor.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:58.756 A:middle
It's super convenient to see all

00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
my prior notes attached before I
