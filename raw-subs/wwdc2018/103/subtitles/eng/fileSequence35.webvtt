00:34:58.486 --> 00:35:00.046 A:middle
because another game of theirs,

00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:02.566 A:middle
called Blek, won an Apple Design

00:35:02.566 --> 00:35:03.916 A:middle
Award in 2014.

00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:06.366 A:middle
They've now returned with a

00:35:06.366 --> 00:35:09.416 A:middle
beautiful and calming freeform

00:35:09.416 --> 00:35:11.896 A:middle
puzzle game that offers a deeply

00:35:11.896 --> 00:35:13.546 A:middle
immersive space where players

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:15.656 A:middle
can interact with and experience

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:16.986 A:middle
the natural phenomenon of

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:17.736 A:middle
swarms.

00:35:18.846 --> 00:35:19.996 A:middle
You've got to see this.

00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:21.726 A:middle
Mike Stern.

00:35:21.766 --> 00:35:22.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:24.436 A:middle
So, swarming behavior has

00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:26.336 A:middle
inspired scientists and artists

00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:27.106 A:middle
through the ages.

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:29.276 A:middle
And now, it's inspired a really

00:35:29.276 --> 00:35:31.256 A:middle
gorgeous and inventive game.

00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:33.136 A:middle
Right from the level selection

00:35:33.136 --> 00:35:34.246 A:middle
screen we can see this number

00:35:34.246 --> 00:35:36.296 A:middle
one is comprised of tiny little

00:35:36.296 --> 00:35:37.496 A:middle
light creatures swarming about.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.716 A:middle
And as we switch between levels

00:35:39.716 --> 00:35:41.016 A:middle
we can see them scatter and

00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.206 A:middle
reform giving us a preview of

00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:44.636 A:middle
what's to come.

00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:46.196 A:middle
Now, when we get into the game

00:35:46.196 --> 00:35:47.656 A:middle
we see this stream of blue

00:35:47.656 --> 00:35:49.136 A:middle
creatures enter the gameboard.

00:35:49.136 --> 00:35:50.756 A:middle
And our objective, here, is to

00:35:50.756 --> 00:35:52.456 A:middle
help these little guys find

00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:53.636 A:middle
their way back to their home

00:35:53.636 --> 00:35:54.096 A:middle
planets.

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:56.426 A:middle
Now, Frost was designed for

00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.226 A:middle
Touch and it really shows.

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926 A:middle
Interactions are so simple and
