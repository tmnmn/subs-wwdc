life.

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.016 A:middle
Incredible things come to life.

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
And that's why we feel deeply

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.506 A:middle
that you, as developers, are

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:07.776 A:middle
amazingly creative.

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.586 A:middle
Like a paintbrush to an artist,

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.006 A:middle
chords to a composer, words to

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:17.926 A:middle
an author, code is an even more

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:19.216 A:middle
advanced creative tool.

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.866 A:middle
Because it can really do and

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.136 A:middle
create so much.

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.926 A:middle
As developers, you're developing

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.736 A:middle
on the canvas of the entire

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.816 A:middle
world causing great new

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.086 A:middle
groundbreaking apps and ideas to

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:36.026 A:middle
take shape.

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.006 A:middle
And each year new and

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.366 A:middle
transformative apps are

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.326 A:middle
introduced bases on those ideas.

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.426 A:middle
And each time this happens you

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.116 A:middle
take creativity to new levels.

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
For example, take a look at the

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.326 A:middle
last three years of Apple Design

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:54.706 A:middle
Award winners.

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:57.216 A:middle
There are incredible games here.

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:02.296 A:middle
Powerful design tools.
