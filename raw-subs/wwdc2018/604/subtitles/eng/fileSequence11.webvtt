00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:01.076 A:middle
delineation between commands

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:02.916 A:middle
directed to different sets of

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:03.506 A:middle
render targets.

00:11:04.186 --> 00:11:06.196 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about

00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:07.896 A:middle
the object you'll use for

00:11:07.896 --> 00:11:08.256 A:middle
rendering.

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:10.476 A:middle
Metal has a number of similar

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:11.276 A:middle
objects to OpenGL.

00:11:11.276 --> 00:11:14.346 A:middle
There are textures, buffers,

00:11:15.136 --> 00:11:17.846 A:middle
samplers and pipeline state

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:19.666 A:middle
objects which resemble OpenGL's

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:22.086 A:middle
program objects, and also depth

00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:23.766 A:middle
stencil state objects which

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:24.966 A:middle
don't really exists in OpenGL

00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:26.706 A:middle
but are just the containers for

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.156 A:middle
the same depth and stencil state

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.346 A:middle
that OpenGL's got.

00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:32.996 A:middle
One significant difference

00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:35.556 A:middle
between OpenGL and Metal objects

00:11:35.906 --> 00:11:37.616 A:middle
are how they are created and

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:37.866 A:middle
managed.

00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:40.336 A:middle
The objects are all created from

00:11:40.336 --> 00:11:41.756 A:middle
a device object so they're

00:11:41.756 --> 00:11:43.426 A:middle
associated with a single GPU.

00:11:44.716 --> 00:11:46.156 A:middle
You set most of an object state

00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:48.316 A:middle
when you create it by specifying

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:50.186 A:middle
properties in a descriptor

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:50.656 A:middle
object.

00:11:51.936 --> 00:11:53.656 A:middle
All states set when the object

00:11:53.656 --> 00:11:55.166 A:middle
is created is fixed and

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:55.596 A:middle
immutable.

00:11:56.946 --> 00:11:58.306 A:middle
Although the state of textures

00:11:58.306 --> 00:11:59.856 A:middle
and buffers are fixed upon

00:11:59.856 --> 00:12:02.226 A:middle
creation, data contained by
