00:13:58.466 --> 00:14:00.156 A:middle
Like GLSL there are built-in

00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:02.796 A:middle
vector and matrix types, and

00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:04.176 A:middle
numerous built-in functions and

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.856 A:middle
operators commonly used for

00:14:05.856 --> 00:14:06.436 A:middle
graphics.

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:09.236 A:middle
And there are classes to specify

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.006 A:middle
sampler state and operate on

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:11.426 A:middle
textures.

00:14:12.966 --> 00:14:13.986 A:middle
The best way to describe the

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.166 A:middle
language is just to show you.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.166 A:middle
So here is a vertex and fragment

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:17.846 A:middle
shader pair.

00:14:19.336 --> 00:14:20.966 A:middle
The vertex keyword at the

00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:22.516 A:middle
function at the top specifies

00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:24.196 A:middle
that that function is a vertex

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.886 A:middle
shader, likewise for the

00:14:25.886 --> 00:14:27.496 A:middle
fragment keyword for the

00:14:27.496 --> 00:14:28.306 A:middle
function at the bottom.

00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:31.366 A:middle
Note that they have custom names

00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:33.226 A:middle
unlike GLSL where every shader

00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:34.116 A:middle
is just called main.

00:14:34.756 --> 00:14:35.726 A:middle
This is important because it

00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:37.166 A:middle
allows you to build large

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:38.976 A:middle
libraries of unique shaders

00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:40.966 A:middle
using names to indicate what

00:14:41.026 --> 00:14:41.506 A:middle
they do.

00:14:41.936 --> 00:14:44.446 A:middle
Anything passed from your

00:14:44.446 --> 00:14:46.176 A:middle
application is an argument to

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:47.266 A:middle
one of these shaders.

00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:49.316 A:middle
There aren't any loose variables

00:14:49.316 --> 00:14:50.486 A:middle
outside of functions as there

00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.416 A:middle
are with GLSL.

00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:53.786 A:middle
As you can see, there are these

00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:55.216 A:middle
bracketed symbols next to each

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:55.646 A:middle
parameter.

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:58.136 A:middle
These are attribute specifiers

00:14:58.386 --> 00:14:59.946 A:middle
which extend upon the C++

00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:01.656 A:middle
language to indicate special
