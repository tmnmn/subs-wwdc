00:38:58.756 --> 00:39:01.546 A:middle
optimal synchronization strategy

00:39:01.546 --> 00:39:02.566 A:middle
which suits best for your

00:39:02.566 --> 00:39:03.376 A:middle
applications.

00:39:04.256 --> 00:39:06.966 A:middle
So in most cases, best approach

00:39:07.026 --> 00:39:08.686 A:middle
is to multi-buffer your shared

00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:11.706 A:middle
resources so that CPU and GPU

00:39:11.706 --> 00:39:13.286 A:middle
are never trying to access the

00:39:13.286 --> 00:39:15.136 A:middle
same buffer simultaneously.

00:39:17.436 --> 00:39:19.916 A:middle
So let's see an example, you

00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:22.126 A:middle
have an OpenGL application and

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.676 A:middle
you just ported it to Metal and

00:39:24.736 --> 00:39:26.296 A:middle
it is using single buffer for

00:39:26.296 --> 00:39:28.956 A:middle
these dynamic data updates and

00:39:28.956 --> 00:39:30.386 A:middle
you did not implement any

00:39:30.386 --> 00:39:32.766 A:middle
synchronization method yet in

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:34.306 A:middle
your application, then here's

00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:36.356 A:middle
what will happen.

00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:38.316 A:middle
Your application will write to

00:39:38.316 --> 00:39:39.956 A:middle
that buffer while generating

00:39:39.956 --> 00:39:41.866 A:middle
commands for the first frame and

00:39:41.866 --> 00:39:43.336 A:middle
then submits this command buffer

00:39:43.336 --> 00:39:45.426 A:middle
to GPU.

00:39:45.426 --> 00:39:47.406 A:middle
Then GPU when it is executing

00:39:47.406 --> 00:39:48.876 A:middle
this command buffer will try to

00:39:48.876 --> 00:39:49.896 A:middle
read from this buffer.

00:39:50.436 --> 00:39:53.796 A:middle
And while you're updating the

00:39:53.796 --> 00:39:55.446 A:middle
same buffer for the next frame

00:39:55.686 --> 00:39:57.486 A:middle
GPU is still reading from this

00:39:57.486 --> 00:39:57.816 A:middle
buffer.

00:39:58.076 --> 00:40:01.266 A:middle
So this is clearly a race
