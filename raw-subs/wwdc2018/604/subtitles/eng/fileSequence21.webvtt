00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:00.776 A:middle
them when you run your app.

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.436 A:middle
Finally, if you compile at

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.766 A:middle
runtime you can't include

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:06.246 A:middle
headers in your shaders, so you

00:21:06.246 --> 00:21:07.526 A:middle
can't share types between your

00:21:07.526 --> 00:21:09.396 A:middle
shaders or your application

00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:09.686 A:middle
code.

00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:12.776 A:middle
If you use runtime share

00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:14.546 A:middle
compilation to get your app up

00:21:14.546 --> 00:21:16.066 A:middle
and running quickly I strongly

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.146 A:middle
encourage you to spend some time

00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:19.086 A:middle
getting your shaders to build

00:21:19.086 --> 00:21:19.966 A:middle
within Xcode.

00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:21.676 A:middle
This way you can benefit from

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:23.056 A:middle
not only the runtime performance

00:21:23.056 --> 00:21:24.246 A:middle
savings but also these

00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:25.546 A:middle
conveniences in shader

00:21:25.546 --> 00:21:26.046 A:middle
development.

00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:29.426 A:middle
Let's move onto the steps your

00:21:29.426 --> 00:21:30.646 A:middle
app will need to take to

00:21:30.646 --> 00:21:31.946 A:middle
initialize your Metal renderer,

00:21:32.186 --> 00:21:33.376 A:middle
so this includes creating a

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.246 A:middle
number of objects.

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:36.286 A:middle
I'll start out with the devices

00:21:36.286 --> 00:21:37.666 A:middle
and command queues and then I'll

00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:39.826 A:middle
describe how to create objects

00:21:39.826 --> 00:21:40.966 A:middle
for your assets, including

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.936 A:middle
textures, buffers and pipeline

00:21:42.936 --> 00:21:43.426 A:middle
objects.

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:47.566 A:middle
So devices and queues.

00:21:47.726 --> 00:21:49.246 A:middle
These are the first objects

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:50.016 A:middle
you'll create.

00:21:50.636 --> 00:21:53.506 A:middle
The device is an abstract

00:21:53.506 --> 00:21:54.866 A:middle
representation of a GPU.

00:21:56.226 --> 00:21:57.346 A:middle
It's responsible for creating

00:21:57.346 --> 00:21:58.436 A:middle
objects that are used for

00:21:58.436 --> 00:21:59.416 A:middle
rendering including these

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.956 A:middle
textures, buffers and pipeline
