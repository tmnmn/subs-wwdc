00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:01.336 A:middle
Let's look at this vertex output

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:02.946 A:middle
type returned by our vertex

00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:03.186 A:middle
shader.

00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:06.506 A:middle
Its definition here specifies

00:16:06.506 --> 00:16:07.736 A:middle
what's passed down for the

00:16:07.736 --> 00:16:09.186 A:middle
rasterization stage and

00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:10.466 A:middle
eventually to the fragment

00:16:10.466 --> 00:16:10.806 A:middle
program.

00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:13.756 A:middle
The four-component

00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:15.146 A:middle
floating-point member named

00:16:15.186 --> 00:16:17.396 A:middle
clipPos has this position

00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:18.766 A:middle
attribute specifier next to it.

00:16:19.336 --> 00:16:20.756 A:middle
This indicates that this member

00:16:20.756 --> 00:16:22.096 A:middle
will serve as the output

00:16:22.136 --> 00:16:23.746 A:middle
position of our vertex shader.

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:26.376 A:middle
This texCoord member which

00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:27.326 A:middle
doesn't have an attribute

00:16:27.326 --> 00:16:30.096 A:middle
specifier defaults to a variable

00:16:30.306 --> 00:16:31.656 A:middle
that will be interpolated with

00:16:31.656 --> 00:16:34.986 A:middle
the texture coordinate values of

00:16:34.986 --> 00:16:36.726 A:middle
other vertices defining the

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:38.616 A:middle
rasterized triangle much like a

00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:39.986 A:middle
varying in GLSL.

00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:42.616 A:middle
Let's take a look at some of the

00:16:42.616 --> 00:16:43.786 A:middle
parameters of our fragment

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:44.046 A:middle
shader.

00:16:45.146 --> 00:16:46.796 A:middle
So we're using this vertexOutput

00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:48.966 A:middle
struct that we just looked at

00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:50.846 A:middle
down here as an input to our

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:51.716 A:middle
fragment shader.

00:16:52.336 --> 00:16:53.966 A:middle
And it gives us the interpolated

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:55.446 A:middle
texture coordinate that we

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:57.346 A:middle
constructed in the vertex shader

00:16:58.486 --> 00:17:00.206 A:middle
and we use it here to sample
