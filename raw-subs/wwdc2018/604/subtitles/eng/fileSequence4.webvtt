00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:01.146 A:middle
If the interface needed to be

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:02.416 A:middle
predictable to prevent

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:04.056 A:middle
developers from falling into

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:08.586 A:middle
hidden pitfalls in the API every

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:09.926 A:middle
call should have an obvious

00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:12.146 A:middle
consequence and few operations

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:13.846 A:middle
should be performed implicitly.

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:16.476 A:middle
Part of this predictability

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:17.805 A:middle
would be the need to control

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:19.916 A:middle
where resources were placed and

00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:21.826 A:middle
if and when synchronization was

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:22.376 A:middle
necessary.

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:26.156 A:middle
Now Apple had a few other

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:26.686 A:middle
requirements.

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:29.456 A:middle
We wanted this interface to be

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.416 A:middle
approachable, it needed to have

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:32.536 A:middle
the right balance between

00:04:32.536 --> 00:04:34.306 A:middle
low-level control and clear

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.436 A:middle
usage because the easier it is

00:04:36.436 --> 00:04:37.556 A:middle
for you to understand something

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.156 A:middle
the more effectively and

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:40.566 A:middle
efficiently you can use it.

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:43.766 A:middle
And of course, we designed Metal

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:46.516 A:middle
to map well to all modern GPUs.

00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:49.486 A:middle
In particular, we knew that

00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:50.446 A:middle
hardware coming down the

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:52.666 A:middle
pipeline needed software that

00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:53.216 A:middle
could push it.

00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:55.556 A:middle
This included the Apple designed

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.486 A:middle
GPU of the A11 bionic.

00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:01.326 A:middle
So how is Metal different than
