00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:00.226 A:middle
rendering application.

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:02.166 A:middle
You build the app compiling

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:03.746 A:middle
source and bundling your assets.

00:13:04.696 --> 00:13:05.926 A:middle
Start up and initializing it.

00:13:06.306 --> 00:13:07.796 A:middle
Loading the assets and

00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:09.666 A:middle
initializing objects that will

00:13:09.666 --> 00:13:11.386 A:middle
persist for the lifetime of your

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:11.986 A:middle
application.

00:13:13.236 --> 00:13:14.966 A:middle
And you repeatedly render

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:16.976 A:middle
setting up state, issuing many

00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:19.336 A:middle
draw calls, and presenting frame

00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:19.986 A:middle
after frame.

00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:23.816 A:middle
I'll talk about developing for

00:13:23.816 --> 00:13:25.686 A:middle
Metal in the earlier stages of

00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:26.796 A:middle
the application's lifetime,

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:29.806 A:middle
including building shaders

00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:31.176 A:middle
offline and creating object's

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:32.136 A:middle
initialization.

00:13:33.256 --> 00:13:34.666 A:middle
And Sukanya will describe how to

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:36.396 A:middle
port your per frame rendering

00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:36.656 A:middle
code.

00:13:38.676 --> 00:13:39.936 A:middle
So let's start out with

00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:41.706 A:middle
application build time which is

00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:43.166 A:middle
where shaders are typically

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:43.736 A:middle
compiled.

00:13:44.896 --> 00:13:46.246 A:middle
We'll begin with a look at the

00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:47.006 A:middle
shading language.

00:13:47.866 --> 00:13:49.006 A:middle
The Metal shading language is

00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:50.476 A:middle
based on C++.

00:13:50.936 --> 00:13:53.316 A:middle
So just like C++ you can create

00:13:53.386 --> 00:13:55.206 A:middle
classes, templates, structures,

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:57.336 A:middle
define enums and namespaces.

00:13:58.466 --> 00:14:00.156 A:middle
Like GLSL there are built-in
