00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:01.976 A:middle
you might want to consider

00:36:02.146 --> 00:36:03.396 A:middle
splitting your frame across

00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:04.606 A:middle
multiple command buffers.

00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:08.086 A:middle
And then the GPU can get started

00:36:08.086 --> 00:36:09.796 A:middle
executing one command buffer

00:36:10.086 --> 00:36:11.486 A:middle
while CPU is encoding the

00:36:11.486 --> 00:36:11.886 A:middle
others.

00:36:13.346 --> 00:36:15.106 A:middle
Alternatively, splitting your

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.386 A:middle
frame encoding across multiple

00:36:17.386 --> 00:36:19.136 A:middle
threads requires you to create

00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:20.436 A:middle
one command buffer per thread.

00:36:20.436 --> 00:36:23.196 A:middle
But keep in mind that there is

00:36:23.196 --> 00:36:25.056 A:middle
some additional CPU cost

00:36:25.056 --> 00:36:26.666 A:middle
associated with each command

00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:27.056 A:middle
buffer.

00:36:27.496 --> 00:36:29.446 A:middle
So you should be using as few as

00:36:29.516 --> 00:36:30.066 A:middle
possible.

00:36:32.216 --> 00:36:34.306 A:middle
Metal also provides an API to

00:36:34.356 --> 00:36:36.436 A:middle
register a completion callback,

00:36:37.136 --> 00:36:38.846 A:middle
which will be involved when GPU

00:36:38.846 --> 00:36:41.006 A:middle
completes executing this command

00:36:41.006 --> 00:36:41.386 A:middle
buffer.

00:36:41.986 --> 00:36:43.686 A:middle
So let me show you all these

00:36:43.686 --> 00:36:44.766 A:middle
APIs in action.

00:36:45.216 --> 00:36:48.316 A:middle
So you will have created command

00:36:48.316 --> 00:36:49.516 A:middle
queue in your application

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:50.856 A:middle
initialization method.

00:36:51.356 --> 00:36:53.246 A:middle
Now in render loop you will use

00:36:53.246 --> 00:36:55.676 A:middle
it to obtain command buffer by

00:36:55.676 --> 00:36:56.876 A:middle
calling its command buffer

00:36:56.876 --> 00:36:57.386 A:middle
method.

00:36:57.946 --> 00:37:00.156 A:middle
Now you will encode commands
