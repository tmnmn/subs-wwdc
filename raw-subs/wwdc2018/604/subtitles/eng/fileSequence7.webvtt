things, it tracks API state, it

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:03.766 A:middle
manages OpenGL objects and other

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:05.246 A:middle
memory, and translates and

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:06.506 A:middle
submits GPU commands.

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:09.066 A:middle
Metal splits all of these jobs

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:10.626 A:middle
of an OpenGL context into a

00:07:10.626 --> 00:07:12.956 A:middle
number of smaller objects.

00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:16.336 A:middle
The first object that creates is

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.616 A:middle
a Metal device which is an

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:20.626 A:middle
abstract representation of a

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:21.686 A:middle
physical GPU.

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:26.286 A:middle
The device creates objects such

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:27.646 A:middle
as textures, buffers and

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:29.216 A:middle
pipeline objects which contain

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:29.906 A:middle
shaders.

00:07:31.026 --> 00:07:32.886 A:middle
It also creates a key object

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:34.636 A:middle
called a Metal command queue.

00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:37.816 A:middle
The command queue really only

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:39.796 A:middle
has one job, to create a

00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:41.176 A:middle
sequence of command buffers.

00:07:41.956 --> 00:07:43.506 A:middle
Here we've created one command

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:44.856 A:middle
buffer and a command buffer is

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:46.706 A:middle
simply a list of GPU commands

00:07:46.956 --> 00:07:48.956 A:middle
that your app will fill and send

00:07:48.956 --> 00:07:50.146 A:middle
to the GPU for execution.

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.836 A:middle
Typically your app will create a

00:07:52.836 --> 00:07:54.926 A:middle
single command buffer per frame,

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:55.866 A:middle
however, there are some

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.566 A:middle
situations where it makes sense

00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:00.166 A:middle
to create two or three in a
