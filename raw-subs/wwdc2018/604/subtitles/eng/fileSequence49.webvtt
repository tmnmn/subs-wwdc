00:48:59.846 --> 00:49:01.456 A:middle
commands we will indicate this

00:49:01.456 --> 00:49:03.396 A:middle
to Metal by calling endEncoding

00:49:03.396 --> 00:49:05.376 A:middle
on the encoder object.

00:49:06.196 --> 00:49:07.916 A:middle
So this was a simple example of

00:49:07.916 --> 00:49:09.406 A:middle
a metal render pass.

00:49:09.926 --> 00:49:12.926 A:middle
Now that we have a complete

00:49:12.926 --> 00:49:14.696 A:middle
render pass let's see how to get

00:49:14.696 --> 00:49:16.286 A:middle
these renderings onto the

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:16.806 A:middle
display.

00:49:17.336 --> 00:49:21.526 A:middle
With OpenGL you present your

00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:23.156 A:middle
rendered frame onto the screen

00:49:23.436 --> 00:49:25.336 A:middle
but you don't explicitly manage

00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:27.996 A:middle
the system's render buffers also

00:49:27.996 --> 00:49:29.006 A:middle
known as drawables.

00:49:30.336 --> 00:49:32.126 A:middle
But with Metal to get your

00:49:32.126 --> 00:49:34.476 A:middle
content displayed on the screen

00:49:34.906 --> 00:49:36.186 A:middle
first you need to obtain the

00:49:36.186 --> 00:49:37.516 A:middle
special textures called

00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:39.116 A:middle
drawables from the system.

00:49:39.746 --> 00:49:41.676 A:middle
So you can use a MetalKit view

00:49:41.816 --> 00:49:42.756 A:middle
which will provide you a

00:49:42.756 --> 00:49:44.846 A:middle
drawable texture for each frame.

00:49:45.426 --> 00:49:46.886 A:middle
And once you obtain this

00:49:46.886 --> 00:49:49.276 A:middle
drawable you can encode render

00:49:49.276 --> 00:49:51.226 A:middle
passes and render to these

00:49:51.226 --> 00:49:53.096 A:middle
drawables just like you would

00:49:53.096 --> 00:49:54.586 A:middle
render to any other texture.

00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:57.766 A:middle
However, unlike other textures

00:49:57.766 --> 00:49:59.236 A:middle
now you can present this

00:49:59.236 --> 00:49:59.976 A:middle
drawable to your view.
