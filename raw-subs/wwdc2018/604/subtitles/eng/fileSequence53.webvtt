Metal supports many more great

00:53:05.296 --> 00:53:07.216 A:middle
features which you can adopt in

00:53:07.216 --> 00:53:08.886 A:middle
your application to improve its

00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:09.706 A:middle
performance.

00:53:10.256 --> 00:53:13.556 A:middle
In addition, as part of your

00:53:13.596 --> 00:53:15.186 A:middle
porting process we highly

00:53:15.186 --> 00:53:17.406 A:middle
encourage to use our Metal

00:53:17.406 --> 00:53:19.096 A:middle
powerful debugging and

00:53:19.096 --> 00:53:21.226 A:middle
optimization tools which are

00:53:21.256 --> 00:53:23.456 A:middle
integrated right into Xcode.

00:53:24.446 --> 00:53:26.476 A:middle
So Metal has a great API

00:53:26.476 --> 00:53:28.536 A:middle
validation layer that will print

00:53:28.796 --> 00:53:30.816 A:middle
detailed information about any

00:53:30.816 --> 00:53:33.176 A:middle
improper API usage and also

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:34.756 A:middle
suggests some potential fixes.

00:53:36.316 --> 00:53:38.826 A:middle
This is a GPU debugger which

00:53:38.826 --> 00:53:40.536 A:middle
gives you a capability to step

00:53:40.596 --> 00:53:42.706 A:middle
through your Metal calls and

00:53:42.706 --> 00:53:44.466 A:middle
view how your frame is being

00:53:44.466 --> 00:53:45.816 A:middle
rendered step-by-step.

00:53:46.726 --> 00:53:48.796 A:middle
You can view all the resources

00:53:48.796 --> 00:53:50.246 A:middle
associated with your frame.

00:53:50.926 --> 00:53:53.116 A:middle
It also provides the GPU expert

00:53:53.166 --> 00:53:54.436 A:middle
tips based on your resource

00:53:54.436 --> 00:53:55.036 A:middle
usage.

00:53:55.586 --> 00:53:58.916 A:middle
For this year we have also added

00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:00.556 A:middle
shader debugging capability
