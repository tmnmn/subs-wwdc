00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.326 A:middle
The OpenGL pipeline was

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:03.826 A:middle
originally an entirely fixed

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:05.746 A:middle
function and although today

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.526 A:middle
OpenGL supports a programmable

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:09.726 A:middle
pipeline it doesn't neatly match

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:12.826 A:middle
that of modern GPUs.

00:03:13.036 --> 00:03:15.356 A:middle
Also, asynchronous processing is

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:16.726 A:middle
not a core feature of the API,

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:18.436 A:middle
there are a number of features

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:19.576 A:middle
which allude to the fact that

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:20.656 A:middle
the GPU works in parallel with

00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:22.076 A:middle
your app but much of this is

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:22.586 A:middle
implicit.

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.586 A:middle
And 25 years ago only the most

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:27.766 A:middle
expensive workstations and

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:29.186 A:middle
servers had multiple cores.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.956 A:middle
So designing an efficient

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:32.716 A:middle
multithreading model wasn't a

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:33.216 A:middle
priority.

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:37.516 A:middle
So back in 2014, it was clear to

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:39.116 A:middle
us that a new application

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:40.286 A:middle
interface for the GPU was

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:40.836 A:middle
necessary.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:42.856 A:middle
Obviously, we needed an

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.176 A:middle
interface that could efficiently

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:45.406 A:middle
harness the GPU's power.

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.076 A:middle
To do that the app needed the

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:49.826 A:middle
CPU out of the way so the GPU

00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:51.946 A:middle
could do its thing.

00:03:52.146 --> 00:03:53.836 A:middle
But when an app needs the CPU

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:54.976 A:middle
for rendering it needs to be

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:56.466 A:middle
able to use all of the CPU,

00:03:56.906 --> 00:03:58.176 A:middle
including its multiple cores.

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:01.146 A:middle
If the interface needed to be
