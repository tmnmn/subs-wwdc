00:44:59.956 --> 00:45:00.906 A:middle
to a render pass.

00:45:01.316 --> 00:45:03.636 A:middle
Now all the draws issued by this

00:45:03.636 --> 00:45:05.596 A:middle
encoder will be rendering to

00:45:05.596 --> 00:45:06.936 A:middle
these render targets.

00:45:08.566 --> 00:45:09.816 A:middle
When you want to draw to a

00:45:09.816 --> 00:45:11.406 A:middle
different set of render targets

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:13.246 A:middle
then you end this render pass

00:45:13.246 --> 00:45:14.226 A:middle
and start a new one.

00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:18.936 A:middle
And here is where we are

00:45:18.936 --> 00:45:20.286 A:middle
creating a render pass

00:45:20.286 --> 00:45:22.916 A:middle
descriptor and binding color and

00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:23.876 A:middle
depth attachments.

00:45:25.166 --> 00:45:27.036 A:middle
Now you can use that descriptor

00:45:27.086 --> 00:45:29.026 A:middle
and create a render command

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:29.716 A:middle
encoder.

00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:33.116 A:middle
Now all the draws issued by this

00:45:33.116 --> 00:45:34.506 A:middle
encoder will be rendering to

00:45:34.506 --> 00:45:34.966 A:middle
these targets.

00:45:37.216 --> 00:45:39.426 A:middle
Additionally, in Metal you can

00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:41.856 A:middle
also provide load and store

00:45:41.856 --> 00:45:43.546 A:middle
actions for these attachments

00:45:43.786 --> 00:45:45.526 A:middle
for optional GPU bandwidth

00:45:45.526 --> 00:45:46.126 A:middle
usage.

00:45:48.236 --> 00:45:50.076 A:middle
So these load and store actions

00:45:50.076 --> 00:45:52.086 A:middle
allow you to control how the

00:45:52.086 --> 00:45:53.796 A:middle
texture contents will be handled

00:45:53.956 --> 00:45:55.486 A:middle
before and after a rendered

00:45:55.526 --> 00:45:55.876 A:middle
pass.

00:45:56.266 --> 00:45:59.016 A:middle
So here we have color and depth

00:45:59.016 --> 00:46:01.856 A:middle
attachments for a render pass.
