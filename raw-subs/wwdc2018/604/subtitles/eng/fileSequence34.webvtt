00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:00.526 A:middle
operation, that's not even

00:34:00.526 --> 00:34:01.586 A:middle
accounting for the processing

00:34:01.586 --> 00:34:02.896 A:middle
required to fill in these

00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:03.726 A:middle
resources with data.

00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:06.076 A:middle
However, once you've created

00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:07.866 A:middle
these objects using them in your

00:34:07.866 --> 00:34:09.646 A:middle
render loop requires very little

00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:11.045 A:middle
CPU over [inaudible] since so

00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:12.966 A:middle
much is done up front.

00:34:14.176 --> 00:34:15.485 A:middle
With that I'd like to hand it

00:34:15.485 --> 00:34:16.716 A:middle
over to Sukanya who will talk

00:34:16.716 --> 00:34:17.735 A:middle
about porting your render loop.

00:34:23.045 --> 00:34:24.065 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good evening everyone, I am

00:34:24.065 --> 00:34:25.886 A:middle
Sukanya Sudugu, GPU software

00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:26.856 A:middle
engineer at Apple.

00:34:27.646 --> 00:34:29.696 A:middle
I am super excited to share some

00:34:29.696 --> 00:34:31.496 A:middle
of our porting experience with

00:34:31.496 --> 00:34:32.976 A:middle
you, so let's continue porting.

00:34:35.876 --> 00:34:37.096 A:middle
Dan already talked about

00:34:37.096 --> 00:34:39.496 A:middle
application setup, so by now you

00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:40.795 A:middle
would have built all your

00:34:40.795 --> 00:34:43.596 A:middle
shaders and also created all

00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:45.216 A:middle
persistent objects needed for

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:46.275 A:middle
frame generation.

00:34:47.196 --> 00:34:48.656 A:middle
So now let's dive into your

00:34:48.656 --> 00:34:50.795 A:middle
application's render loop which

00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:52.516 A:middle
is the code that runs for every

00:34:52.516 --> 00:34:52.926 A:middle
frame.

00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:55.996 A:middle
With Metal you will explicitly

00:34:55.996 --> 00:34:57.616 A:middle
manage the asynchronous nature

00:34:57.616 --> 00:34:59.556 A:middle
of GPU's execution in your

00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:00.196 A:middle
render loop.
