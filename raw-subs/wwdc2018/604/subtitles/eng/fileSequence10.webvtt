00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:00.816 A:middle
The set of commands encoded into

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:01.966 A:middle
a Render Command Encoder is

00:10:02.006 --> 00:10:03.686 A:middle
often referred to as a Render

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:03.836 A:middle
Pass.

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:06.576 A:middle
In a Render Pass you set up

00:10:06.576 --> 00:10:08.016 A:middle
render objects for the graphics

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:10.236 A:middle
pipeline and issue draw commands

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:11.586 A:middle
with those objects.

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:13.726 A:middle
This includes operations similar

00:10:13.726 --> 00:10:15.946 A:middle
to glDrawArrays and

00:10:15.946 --> 00:10:18.696 A:middle
glDrawElements and other OpenGL

00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:19.566 A:middle
draw commands.

00:10:21.006 --> 00:10:22.416 A:middle
Each Render Command Encoder is

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.156 A:middle
strongly associated with a set

00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:25.126 A:middle
of render targets.

00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:28.806 A:middle
And the render target is simply

00:10:28.806 --> 00:10:30.306 A:middle
a texture that can be drawn to.

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:32.636 A:middle
This includes color, depth and

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.166 A:middle
stencil textures, as well as

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.356 A:middle
multi-sample textures.

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:37.606 A:middle
You specify a set of render

00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:38.976 A:middle
targets when you create a render

00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:40.686 A:middle
command encoder from a command

00:10:42.196 --> 00:10:42.336 A:middle
buffer.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.906 A:middle
And all draw commands are

00:10:43.906 --> 00:10:45.596 A:middle
directed to these targets for

00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:47.036 A:middle
the lifetime of the encoder.

00:10:48.506 --> 00:10:49.826 A:middle
To direct commands to a new set

00:10:49.826 --> 00:10:51.396 A:middle
of targets you end encoding with

00:10:51.396 --> 00:10:52.886 A:middle
a current render command encoder

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:55.536 A:middle
and create a new encoder with

00:10:55.536 --> 00:10:56.256 A:middle
new targets.

00:10:57.216 --> 00:10:58.836 A:middle
This creates a very clear

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:01.076 A:middle
delineation between commands
