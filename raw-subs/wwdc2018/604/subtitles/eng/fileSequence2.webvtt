00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:00.446 A:middle
options to consider.

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.156 A:middle
Apple offers several high-level

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:04.906 A:middle
frameworks that do rendering,

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.446 A:middle
different kinds of rendering,

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.846 A:middle
SpriteKit for 2D games, SceneKit

00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:10.756 A:middle
for some 3D, Core Image for

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:11.966 A:middle
great effects.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:15.456 A:middle
Also, each of the major

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.366 A:middle
third-party game engines already

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.176 A:middle
use Metal as their primary

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:19.596 A:middle
renderer.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.886 A:middle
But you may decide that these

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.426 A:middle
approaches just aren't for you

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:25.866 A:middle
and the path forward is to do it

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:28.086 A:middle
yourself in Metal, that's what

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.416 A:middle
we'll talk about today.

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:31.746 A:middle
So let's start out with Metal

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:33.416 A:middle
design and some fundamental

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:33.966 A:middle
concepts.

00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:37.246 A:middle
So OpenGL was originally

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.326 A:middle
designed 25 years ago and its

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.286 A:middle
core reflects the origins of

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.736 A:middle
hardware accelerated 3D

00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:43.226 A:middle
graphics.

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:46.676 A:middle
So updates with new versions and

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:48.266 A:middle
extensions have really served us

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.766 A:middle
well by exposing new GPU

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.146 A:middle
features and performance

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:51.666 A:middle
techniques.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:54.436 A:middle
However, there are still some

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:56.276 A:middle
fundamental design choices that

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.016 A:middle
no longer apply to current

00:02:58.016 --> 00:02:58.396 A:middle
hardware.
