00:50:00.096 --> 00:50:02.506 A:middle
So let me show you a code

00:50:02.506 --> 00:50:02.996 A:middle
sample.

00:50:03.516 --> 00:50:06.196 A:middle
First, I want to mention that

00:50:06.196 --> 00:50:07.886 A:middle
these drawables are limited

00:50:08.166 --> 00:50:10.696 A:middle
shade system resources, so you

00:50:10.696 --> 00:50:12.206 A:middle
should hold on to them as

00:50:12.206 --> 00:50:13.536 A:middle
briefly as possible.

00:50:14.236 --> 00:50:15.776 A:middle
This means that you should

00:50:15.776 --> 00:50:18.096 A:middle
encode all your offscreen render

00:50:18.126 --> 00:50:20.016 A:middle
passes before you acquire a

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:20.606 A:middle
drawable.

00:50:21.906 --> 00:50:23.626 A:middle
Then you can create a MetalKit

00:50:23.626 --> 00:50:26.856 A:middle
view for either a fully

00:50:26.856 --> 00:50:29.206 A:middle
populated render pass descriptor

00:50:29.466 --> 00:50:30.926 A:middle
which you can directly use to

00:50:30.926 --> 00:50:33.836 A:middle
create encoders, which is what

00:50:33.836 --> 00:50:36.336 A:middle
you see here or you can ask for

00:50:36.336 --> 00:50:37.746 A:middle
a specific texture using

00:50:37.976 --> 00:50:41.626 A:middle
view.currentDrawable property.

00:50:41.626 --> 00:50:42.706 A:middle
And then you can build your own

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.276 A:middle
render pass descriptor around

00:50:45.016 --> 00:50:45.086 A:middle
it.

00:50:47.136 --> 00:50:48.846 A:middle
Once you are finished encoding

00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:50.496 A:middle
your frame you can call the

00:50:50.496 --> 00:50:51.896 A:middle
command buffer's present

00:50:51.896 --> 00:50:53.456 A:middle
drawable method which puts your

00:50:53.456 --> 00:50:55.626 A:middle
drawable onto the screen when

00:50:55.626 --> 00:50:57.466 A:middle
GPU finishes executing this

00:50:57.466 --> 00:50:58.166 A:middle
command buffer.

00:50:58.986 --> 00:51:00.946 A:middle
So now once GPU is done
