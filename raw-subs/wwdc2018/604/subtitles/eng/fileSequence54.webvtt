00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:00.556 A:middle
shader debugging capability

00:54:00.916 --> 00:54:02.326 A:middle
where you can debug your shader

00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:03.486 A:middle
functions just like other

00:54:03.486 --> 00:54:04.006 A:middle
functions.

00:54:04.516 --> 00:54:07.686 A:middle
We also added a shader profiler

00:54:07.956 --> 00:54:09.646 A:middle
which showing a rich set of

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:11.266 A:middle
performance metrics related to

00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:11.936 A:middle
your shaders.

00:54:12.046 --> 00:54:15.556 A:middle
And also, a dependency viewer

00:54:15.556 --> 00:54:17.156 A:middle
which allows you to evaluate

00:54:17.156 --> 00:54:18.626 A:middle
dependencies between the render

00:54:18.626 --> 00:54:22.096 A:middle
passes and you can potentially

00:54:22.096 --> 00:54:24.336 A:middle
merge any redundant render

00:54:24.336 --> 00:54:26.726 A:middle
passes to improve your

00:54:26.726 --> 00:54:27.976 A:middle
application's performance.

00:54:30.216 --> 00:54:32.166 A:middle
And finally, the Metal system

00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:33.966 A:middle
trace tool in instruments will

00:54:33.966 --> 00:54:36.696 A:middle
give you a complete view of your

00:54:36.736 --> 00:54:38.486 A:middle
application's behavior and

00:54:38.486 --> 00:54:40.276 A:middle
performance so we highly

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:42.396 A:middle
recommend using these tools to

00:54:42.396 --> 00:54:44.146 A:middle
ease your porting effort.

00:54:45.296 --> 00:54:47.906 A:middle
Wrapping it up, OpenGL and

00:54:47.906 --> 00:54:49.536 A:middle
OpenCL are deprecated.

00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:52.656 A:middle
They are still around but we are

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:54.466 A:middle
discouraging their future use.

00:54:54.826 --> 00:54:56.526 A:middle
It is time to adopt Metal.

00:54:57.216 --> 00:54:59.106 A:middle
We have full suite of developer

00:54:59.106 --> 00:55:00.806 A:middle
tools, a lot of experience
