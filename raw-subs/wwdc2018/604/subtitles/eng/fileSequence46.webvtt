00:45:59.016 --> 00:46:01.856 A:middle
attachments for a render pass.

00:46:02.066 --> 00:46:03.856 A:middle
If it specified the load action

00:46:03.856 --> 00:46:05.906 A:middle
as clear for both of these

00:46:05.906 --> 00:46:08.346 A:middle
render targets the GPU will

00:46:08.386 --> 00:46:09.836 A:middle
first clear their contents.

00:46:10.266 --> 00:46:13.246 A:middle
Then the GPU will execute

00:46:13.246 --> 00:46:14.556 A:middle
commands in this encoder

00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:15.686 A:middle
rendering to these render

00:46:15.686 --> 00:46:16.346 A:middle
targets.

00:46:16.886 --> 00:46:19.616 A:middle
Now you can specify the store

00:46:19.616 --> 00:46:21.026 A:middle
actions to be performed at the

00:46:21.136 --> 00:46:22.176 A:middle
end of the render pass.

00:46:22.536 --> 00:46:24.486 A:middle
Here for the color buffer since

00:46:24.486 --> 00:46:25.996 A:middle
the store action is store it

00:46:25.996 --> 00:46:28.656 A:middle
will preserve the contents of

00:46:28.686 --> 00:46:30.256 A:middle
this color buffer at the end of

00:46:30.256 --> 00:46:30.966 A:middle
the render pass.

00:46:31.576 --> 00:46:33.006 A:middle
And for the depth attachment,

00:46:33.006 --> 00:46:35.286 A:middle
since we said store action as

00:46:35.286 --> 00:46:37.176 A:middle
don't care it will discard its

00:46:37.176 --> 00:46:37.786 A:middle
contents.

00:46:39.006 --> 00:46:40.876 A:middle
So these texture load and stores

00:46:40.876 --> 00:46:42.806 A:middle
are expensive GPU operations

00:46:42.806 --> 00:46:44.376 A:middle
that consumes memory bandwidth.

00:46:44.946 --> 00:46:47.346 A:middle
So choose clear and don't care

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:48.416 A:middle
wherever possible.

00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:51.816 A:middle
And here is how you set your

00:46:51.896 --> 00:46:52.246 A:middle
action.

00:46:52.526 --> 00:46:54.876 A:middle
In this example we specify clear

00:46:54.876 --> 00:46:57.246 A:middle
as a load action and set the

00:46:57.286 --> 00:46:57.966 A:middle
clear color.

00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:00.806 A:middle
And here we specify store action
