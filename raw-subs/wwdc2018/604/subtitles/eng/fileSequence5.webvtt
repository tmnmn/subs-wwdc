00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:01.326 A:middle
So how is Metal different than

00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:01.736 A:middle
OpenGL?

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:03.556 A:middle
Well you perform the most

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.036 A:middle
expensive operations less often.

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:08.236 A:middle
Objects are designed in such a

00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:09.916 A:middle
way that API state can be

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:12.226 A:middle
translated and prepackaged into

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:13.926 A:middle
GPU commands at creation.

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:17.406 A:middle
This way, there's much less cost

00:05:17.406 --> 00:05:18.556 A:middle
to use them later on when

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:19.266 A:middle
actually rendering.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:21.656 A:middle
The graphics pipeline with

00:05:21.686 --> 00:05:23.286 A:middle
Vertex and fragment shaders also

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:24.756 A:middle
reflects the modern GPU.

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.396 A:middle
So it's less costly to translate

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:29.526 A:middle
the API's configuration to GP

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:29.986 A:middle
commands.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:32.926 A:middle
This doesn't mean the pipeline

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.296 A:middle
is entirely different or

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:35.666 A:middle
requires some whole new way of

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:36.026 A:middle
thinking.

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.256 A:middle
The main difference in Metal is

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:39.406 A:middle
that the grouping of the

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:41.686 A:middle
pipeline stages into objects is

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.326 A:middle
more efficient, not that the

00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:45.396 A:middle
pipeline itself is changed.

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:49.366 A:middle
Metal also has a clear model for

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:50.616 A:middle
multithreaded execution.

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:52.356 A:middle
There are a number of different

00:05:52.356 --> 00:05:53.976 A:middle
ways for applications to drive

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:55.796 A:middle
the GPU from different threads,

00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:57.906 A:middle
but for each there are explicit

00:05:57.996 --> 00:05:59.456 A:middle
but unconstraining rules to do

00:05:59.456 --> 00:05:59.686 A:middle
this.
