00:54:59.106 --> 00:55:00.806 A:middle
tools, a lot of experience

00:55:00.806 --> 00:55:02.896 A:middle
helping many teams successfully

00:55:02.896 --> 00:55:04.616 A:middle
go through this effort and come

00:55:04.616 --> 00:55:06.376 A:middle
out with substantially improved

00:55:06.376 --> 00:55:07.006 A:middle
performance.

00:55:07.736 --> 00:55:09.236 A:middle
I'm hoping the information we

00:55:09.236 --> 00:55:10.846 A:middle
shared today will give you

00:55:10.846 --> 00:55:12.356 A:middle
smooth porting experience.

00:55:12.866 --> 00:55:15.846 A:middle
And we are very happy to talk to

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:17.376 A:middle
you about your applications and

00:55:17.376 --> 00:55:18.836 A:middle
how to get them up and running

00:55:18.836 --> 00:55:19.406 A:middle
with Metal.

00:55:20.006 --> 00:55:21.776 A:middle
So we will be available tomorrow

00:55:21.776 --> 00:55:23.506 A:middle
afternoon at OpenGL to Metal

00:55:23.666 --> 00:55:25.736 A:middle
porting lab and there are many

00:55:25.736 --> 00:55:27.696 A:middle
upcoming sessions on Metal.

00:55:28.006 --> 00:55:29.426 A:middle
I recommend attending these

00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:31.546 A:middle
sessions to learn more about how

00:55:31.546 --> 00:55:33.106 A:middle
to debug and optimize your

00:55:33.106 --> 00:55:34.466 A:middle
applications with Metal.

00:55:36.106 --> 00:55:37.866 A:middle
With that I thank you all for

00:55:37.866 --> 00:55:39.706 A:middle
attending and I hope you enjoy

00:55:39.706 --> 00:55:40.716 A:middle
the rest of your week.
