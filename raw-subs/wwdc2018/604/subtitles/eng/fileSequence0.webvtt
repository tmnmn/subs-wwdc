00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:28.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:30.746 A:middle
My name is Dan Omachi, I'm an

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:32.036 A:middle
engineer in Apple's Metal

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:32.946 A:middle
Ecosystem Team.

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:35.536 A:middle
Now my main role on that team is

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.136 A:middle
to help developers learn Metal

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.346 A:middle
and have a great experience

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:38.766 A:middle
using it.

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.326 A:middle
But prior to this I worked on

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:43.456 A:middle
Apple's OpenGL and OpenGL ES

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:44.686 A:middle
frameworks for many years.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.716 A:middle
And even before joining Apple I

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:47.746 A:middle
worked on a couple of other

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:48.936 A:middle
OpenGL implementations.

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:53.286 A:middle
So I'm really proud of what

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:55.576 A:middle
we've accomplished with OpenGL

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:57.866 A:middle
over the past years, but I'm

00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.976 A:middle
also really excited about the

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.166 A:middle
direction Metal's taking us.
