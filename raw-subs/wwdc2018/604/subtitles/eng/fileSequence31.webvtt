00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:00.506 A:middle
render pipeline objects that

00:31:00.506 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
contain them.

00:31:02.776 --> 00:31:04.046 A:middle
You create one of these pipeline

00:31:04.046 --> 00:31:05.766 A:middle
state objects using a render

00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:07.096 A:middle
pipeline descriptor object.

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.116 A:middle
The object contains a vertex and

00:31:10.116 --> 00:31:11.066 A:middle
fragment shader pair.

00:31:12.446 --> 00:31:13.886 A:middle
It also specifies the layout of

00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:15.516 A:middle
vertices feeding the vertex

00:31:16.286 --> 00:31:16.416 A:middle
shader.

00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:19.506 A:middle
And also blend state and the

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.586 A:middle
pixel formats of render targets

00:31:21.866 --> 00:31:23.706 A:middle
that the fragment and shader can

00:31:23.706 --> 00:31:24.136 A:middle
render to.

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:27.206 A:middle
Just like with the texture

00:31:27.206 --> 00:31:28.556 A:middle
object you call method on the

00:31:28.556 --> 00:31:30.136 A:middle
device which will produce an

00:31:30.136 --> 00:31:31.996 A:middle
immutable render state pipeline

00:31:31.996 --> 00:31:32.406 A:middle
object.

00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:34.926 A:middle
And also like a texture object

00:31:35.056 --> 00:31:36.306 A:middle
you only need the descriptor to

00:31:36.306 --> 00:31:37.546 A:middle
create that object.

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:40.456 A:middle
Here's some code showing how to

00:31:40.456 --> 00:31:41.726 A:middle
build these pipeline state

00:31:41.726 --> 00:31:42.226 A:middle
objects.

00:31:43.536 --> 00:31:44.916 A:middle
Before you create the pipeline,

00:31:45.096 --> 00:31:47.456 A:middle
you'll need to get the shaders

00:31:47.456 --> 00:31:48.686 A:middle
out of a Metal library.

00:31:49.256 --> 00:31:51.446 A:middle
This line here loads the default

00:31:51.446 --> 00:31:53.816 A:middle
Metal library that we built in

00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:54.586 A:middle
Xcode.

00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:56.616 A:middle
For this library you can obtain

00:31:56.616 --> 00:31:58.316 A:middle
your vertex and fragment shader

00:31:59.116 --> 00:32:00.726 A:middle
using their function names.
