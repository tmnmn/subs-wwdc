00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.956 A:middle
textures, buffers and pipeline

00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:01.386 A:middle
objects.

00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:04.506 A:middle
In iOS since there's only ever

00:22:04.506 --> 00:22:06.826 A:middle
one GPU there's only one device

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.626 A:middle
you can get, but on macOS

00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:10.356 A:middle
systems can have multiple

00:22:10.356 --> 00:22:12.216 A:middle
devices since there may be both

00:22:12.216 --> 00:22:14.126 A:middle
an integrated and discrete GPU

00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:16.026 A:middle
and even multiple eGPUs.

00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:18.286 A:middle
Usually though, getting the

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:20.146 A:middle
default device is sufficient for

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:21.126 A:middle
most applications.

00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:23.776 A:middle
And getting this device is

00:22:23.826 --> 00:22:25.216 A:middle
really simple, you call

00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:26.876 A:middle
MTLCreateSystem

00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:27.616 A:middle
DefaultDevice.

00:22:28.296 --> 00:22:31.136 A:middle
One of the first things you'll

00:22:31.136 --> 00:22:33.396 A:middle
do with this device is create a

00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:33.966 A:middle
command queue.

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:37.416 A:middle
The queue is used mostly in your

00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:38.736 A:middle
applications render loop to

00:22:38.736 --> 00:22:40.036 A:middle
obtain command buffers each

00:22:40.086 --> 00:22:41.536 A:middle
frame, but you want to create

00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:42.836 A:middle
the command queue at

00:22:42.996 --> 00:22:43.826 A:middle
initialization.

00:22:45.036 --> 00:22:46.176 A:middle
Typically, a single queue is

00:22:46.176 --> 00:22:48.006 A:middle
sufficient but more complex apps

00:22:48.276 --> 00:22:49.926 A:middle
that execute many tasks in

00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:51.566 A:middle
parallel may need multiple

00:22:51.596 --> 00:22:51.986 A:middle
queues.

00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:54.696 A:middle
Creating a queue is also really

00:22:54.696 --> 00:22:56.666 A:middle
simple, you call newCommandQueue

00:22:56.906 --> 00:22:57.936 A:middle
with the device you just

00:22:57.936 --> 00:22:58.336 A:middle
created.

00:22:58.956 --> 00:22:59.996 A:middle
And once you've got your queue
