00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:01.656 A:middle
language to indicate special

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:02.236 A:middle
variables.

00:15:03.456 --> 00:15:05.666 A:middle
So this vertex ID attribute

00:15:05.746 --> 00:15:07.446 A:middle
indicates that this VID

00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:08.576 A:middle
parameter should contain the

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:11.126 A:middle
index of the current vertex when

00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:12.826 A:middle
this vertex executes.

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:14.906 A:middle
It's used down here in two

00:15:14.906 --> 00:15:17.166 A:middle
places to index into an array of

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:17.676 A:middle
vertices.

00:15:18.226 --> 00:15:20.636 A:middle
These parameters here with a

00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:22.866 A:middle
buffer attribute specifier these

00:15:22.866 --> 00:15:24.186 A:middle
indicate that these variables

00:15:24.226 --> 00:15:26.106 A:middle
are filled by buffer's objects

00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:27.436 A:middle
set in the Metal API.

00:15:27.436 --> 00:15:29.596 A:middle
I'll talk more about how the

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.106 A:middle
Metal API relates to these in

00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:31.596 A:middle
just a minute.

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:33.626 A:middle
But first let's take a closer

00:15:33.626 --> 00:15:34.926 A:middle
look at some of the types used

00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:35.136 A:middle
here.

00:15:36.056 --> 00:15:37.776 A:middle
Now these are all custom types

00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:39.386 A:middle
that you would define.

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.656 A:middle
The vertices parameter here is

00:15:41.656 --> 00:15:43.606 A:middle
defined as a pointer to a vertex

00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:45.656 A:middle
type and its definition is right

00:15:45.656 --> 00:15:45.886 A:middle
here.

00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:48.836 A:middle
The structure has two members, a

00:15:48.836 --> 00:15:50.586 A:middle
model position member and a

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:51.736 A:middle
texture coordinate member.

00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:54.116 A:middle
It defines the layout and memory

00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:56.186 A:middle
of each vertex in a vertex array

00:15:56.526 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
passed into this vertex shader.

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:01.336 A:middle
Let's look at this vertex output
