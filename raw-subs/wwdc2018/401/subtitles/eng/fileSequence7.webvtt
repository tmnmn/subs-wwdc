00:06:57.696 --> 00:07:00.186 A:middle
Today's focus is on Swift 4.2,

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.596 A:middle
which is an important waypoint

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:02.696 A:middle
toward Swift 5.

00:07:03.426 --> 00:07:05.446 A:middle
Let's talk about source

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:06.166 A:middle
compatibility.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:10.106 A:middle
So just like in Xcode 9, Xcode

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:12.026 A:middle
10 shifts with one Swift

00:07:12.226 --> 00:07:12.696 A:middle
compiler.

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:15.086 A:middle
So if you're using Xcode 10, you

00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:16.256 A:middle
are using Swift 4.2.

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:19.716 A:middle
However, just like in Xcode 9,

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.746 A:middle
the compiler also supports

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:23.896 A:middle
multiple language compatibility

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:24.366 A:middle
modes.

00:07:25.256 --> 00:07:27.026 A:middle
Now in all the modes you can use

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:27.906 A:middle
all the new APIs.

00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:29.926 A:middle
You can use all the new language

00:07:29.926 --> 00:07:30.476 A:middle
features.

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:31.676 A:middle
What these gate are

00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:33.476 A:middle
source-impacting changes.

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:37.286 A:middle
The first two are ones that

00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:39.026 A:middle
existed previously in Xcode 9.

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:40.676 A:middle
They're there to provide an out

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:41.776 A:middle
of the box experience that you

00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:43.046 A:middle
can build your Swift 3 and Swift

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.926 A:middle
4 code without modifications.

00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:47.206 A:middle
The Swift 4.2 mode is almost

00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:49.586 A:middle
identical to the 4 mode except

00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:51.216 A:middle
it gates those SDK improvements

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:52.266 A:middle
that are talked about.

00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:54.346 A:middle
That's it.

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:57.026 A:middle
Just some previous versions of

00:07:57.086 --> 00:07:58.526 A:middle
Xcode, there's Migrator Support

00:07:58.526 --> 00:07:59.436 A:middle
that you can find in the edit

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
menu to mechanize most of your
