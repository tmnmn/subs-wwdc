00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.336 A:middle
project are working on bringing

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:01.506 A:middle
Swift support to other

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:02.106 A:middle
platforms.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:03.786 A:middle
And we'd like to support those

00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:04.166 A:middle
efforts.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.726 A:middle
About a month ago we extended

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:08.545 A:middle
the public continuous

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.006 A:middle
integration systems to support

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:12.066 A:middle
community hosted CI notes.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.576 A:middle
So if you are a member of the

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:14.796 A:middle
community interested in bringing

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:16.386 A:middle
Swift to another platform or

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.046 A:middle
effort, you can now seamlessly

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:19.266 A:middle
plug in your own hardware

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.726 A:middle
support to bring testing there.

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:22.776 A:middle
This is a nice prerequisite for

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:23.956 A:middle
supporting Swift in other

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:24.566 A:middle
places.

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:28.816 A:middle
We've also invested tremendously

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:31.056 A:middle
in the community around the

00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:32.716 A:middle
Swift open source project.

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:34.036 A:middle
This is the community that

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:35.476 A:middle
discusses all changes to the

00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:35.966 A:middle
language.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.936 A:middle
About six months ago we moved

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:40.196 A:middle
from using mailing lists, which

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:42.016 A:middle
were very high traffic to

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:42.556 A:middle
forums.

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:44.096 A:middle
This was at the behest of the

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:44.746 A:middle
community.

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:47.046 A:middle
Various people were concerned

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:48.776 A:middle
that they wanted to be able to

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:50.446 A:middle
engage in the project at a level

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:52.386 A:middle
that worked well for them but

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:54.126 A:middle
found it difficult to do so.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:55.586 A:middle
With the forums you can now

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:57.656 A:middle
engage the level that works well

00:02:57.656 --> 00:02:58.066 A:middle
for you.

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:00.926 A:middle
The forums have also worked so
