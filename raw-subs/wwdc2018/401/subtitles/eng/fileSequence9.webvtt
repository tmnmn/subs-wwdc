00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:00.506 A:middle
So let's talk about some

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:01.446 A:middle
improvements to the tooling.

00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:04.076 A:middle
In the State of the Union we

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.006 A:middle
mentioned that there are some

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:06.206 A:middle
significant improvements to

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:07.416 A:middle
build improvement for Swift

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:09.366 A:middle
projects over Xcode 9.

00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:12.176 A:middle
And so these numbers are run on

00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:13.516 A:middle
a 4-Core MacBook Pro i7.

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:16.946 A:middle
Let's look a little bit closer

00:09:16.946 --> 00:09:17.416 A:middle
at one of them.

00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:20.456 A:middle
This project is a mix and match

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:21.776 A:middle
of Objective-C in Swift.

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:23.406 A:middle
It started out as an Objective-C

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:24.666 A:middle
project and started

00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:25.526 A:middle
incorporating Swift.

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:27.786 A:middle
This is a very common scenario.

00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:29.576 A:middle
Now what this Build time

00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:32.156 A:middle
improvement doesn't really

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:33.826 A:middle
underscore is how much faster

00:09:33.876 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
building this Swift Code

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:35.536 A:middle
actually became.

00:09:36.356 --> 00:09:37.526 A:middle
So if we just focus on how much

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:39.826 A:middle
faster the Swift code built, it

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:41.146 A:middle
actually builds three times

00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:42.896 A:middle
faster than it did before.

00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:44.776 A:middle
And so that's why the project

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:47.086 A:middle
has that more modest 1.6x

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:47.536 A:middle
speedup.

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:51.096 A:middle
And what you will see is that

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:52.216 A:middle
the overall build improvements

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:53.706 A:middle
will depend on the nature of

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:54.766 A:middle
your project, how much Swift

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:56.816 A:middle
code it's using, the number of

00:09:56.816 --> 00:09:58.606 A:middle
cores on your machine, but we've

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.146 A:middle
in practice have seen from many
