00:05:58.156 --> 00:06:01.946 A:middle
culminates in Swift 5, which

00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:04.916 A:middle
will be released in early 2019.

00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:07.486 A:middle
So what is binary compatibility?

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:09.806 A:middle
Binary compatibility means that

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:11.536 A:middle
you can build your Swift code

00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:12.996 A:middle
with the Swift 5 compiler and

00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:13.286 A:middle
layer.

00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:15.036 A:middle
And at the binary level it will

00:06:15.036 --> 00:06:16.626 A:middle
be able to interoperate with

00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:17.866 A:middle
other code built with that

00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:19.686 A:middle
compiler or any other compiler

00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:20.016 A:middle
layer.

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.266 A:middle
This is a very important

00:06:22.266 --> 00:06:23.966 A:middle
milestone for the maturity of

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:24.506 A:middle
the language.

00:06:25.146 --> 00:06:26.606 A:middle
And what this will enable is

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:28.436 A:middle
Apple to shift the Swift runtime

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:30.746 A:middle
in the operating system, which

00:06:30.746 --> 00:06:32.156 A:middle
means apps can directly use it,

00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:33.496 A:middle
meaning that they no longer need

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:34.666 A:middle
it included in the application

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:34.976 A:middle
bundle.

00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:37.446 A:middle
So this is a code size win but

00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:38.966 A:middle
it's also important that it

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.146 A:middle
impacts things like startup

00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:42.286 A:middle
time, memory usage, it's an

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:43.646 A:middle
overall huge win for the

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:44.056 A:middle
community.

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:46.876 A:middle
If you're -- we've been very

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:48.046 A:middle
transparent on the progress

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:50.196 A:middle
towards ABI stability or binary

00:06:50.196 --> 00:06:50.906 A:middle
compatibility.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.826 A:middle
You can follow along on the ABI

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.366 A:middle
stability dashboard on

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:55.806 A:middle
Swift.org.

00:06:57.696 --> 00:07:00.186 A:middle
Today's focus is on Swift 4.2,
