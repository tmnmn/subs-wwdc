00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:01.406 A:middle
pinpoints in the language that

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:03.276 A:middle
came up in the real world and

00:18:03.276 --> 00:18:05.756 A:middle
you came up with the idea for

00:18:05.756 --> 00:18:07.636 A:middle
fixing these pinpoints and you

00:18:07.636 --> 00:18:09.246 A:middle
contributed these improvements

00:18:09.286 --> 00:18:11.126 A:middle
back to Swift so that everybody

00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:11.766 A:middle
benefits.

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:12.516 A:middle
Thank you.

00:18:14.516 --> 00:18:19.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:20.936 A:middle
So for the first improvement

00:18:21.126 --> 00:18:22.226 A:middle
we're going to see how to

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.636 A:middle
eliminate a common source of

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:25.226 A:middle
boilerplate when working with

00:18:25.226 --> 00:18:25.486 A:middle
enum's.

00:18:26.566 --> 00:18:27.896 A:middle
So let's say I have to find an

00:18:27.896 --> 00:18:28.196 A:middle
enum.

00:18:28.616 --> 00:18:30.486 A:middle
And I want to print every

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.096 A:middle
possible value that this data

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:32.846 A:middle
type can have.

00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:36.286 A:middle
So in Swift 4, I had to define a

00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:38.636 A:middle
property perhaps with a list of

00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:40.386 A:middle
all the possible cases.

00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:44.656 A:middle
And if I add a new case then I

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.016 A:middle
have to remember to update that

00:18:46.086 --> 00:18:48.376 A:middle
property, otherwise I just get

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:49.706 A:middle
incorrect behavior or runtime.

00:18:50.976 --> 00:18:53.536 A:middle
And this is just not very good

00:18:53.536 --> 00:18:54.936 A:middle
because you're repeating

00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:56.406 A:middle
yourself to the compiler.

00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:59.296 A:middle
So in Swift 4.2 we've added a

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:01.966 A:middle
new CaseIterable protocol and if
