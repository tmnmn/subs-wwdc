00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
menu to mechanize most of your

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:01.556 A:middle
changes.

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:03.876 A:middle
I want to give an important

00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:06.166 A:middle
disclaimer about the Swift 4.2

00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:07.146 A:middle
SDK changes.

00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:09.436 A:middle
Later Xcode 10 betas will likely

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:11.036 A:middle
have further SDK improvements.

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:13.206 A:middle
This is to provide opportunities

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:14.916 A:middle
to incorporate you feedback from

00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:16.976 A:middle
the betas of how these APIs

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:18.676 A:middle
should be improved and how they

00:08:18.676 --> 00:08:19.626 A:middle
reflect into Swift.

00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:22.246 A:middle
This means if you migrate to 4.2

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:23.926 A:middle
early, you should expect there

00:08:23.926 --> 00:08:24.806 A:middle
are going to be some changes

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.096 A:middle
later.

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.166 A:middle
Or you can hold off and migrate

00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:27.446 A:middle
later.

00:08:27.836 --> 00:08:28.816 A:middle
It's completely up to you.

00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:32.176 A:middle
Now with Swift 4.2 we think we

00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:34.126 A:middle
are rapidly converging on what

00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:35.476 A:middle
Swift code is going to look like

00:08:35.876 --> 00:08:36.635 A:middle
going forward.

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:39.155 A:middle
This is an important phase in

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.716 A:middle
the maturation of the language.

00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:43.046 A:middle
And thus we really think it's

00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:44.596 A:middle
important for everyone to move

00:08:44.596 --> 00:08:47.486 A:middle
off of Swift 3 and embrace using

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:48.086 A:middle
Swift 4.2.

00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:49.216 A:middle
There are important code size

00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:50.456 A:middle
improvements there and just

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:51.396 A:middle
overall improvements to the

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:52.006 A:middle
language.

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:54.106 A:middle
And this is Xcode 10 is going to

00:08:54.156 --> 00:08:55.636 A:middle
be the last release to support

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.916 A:middle
that Swift 3 compatibility mode.

00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:00.506 A:middle
So let's talk about some
