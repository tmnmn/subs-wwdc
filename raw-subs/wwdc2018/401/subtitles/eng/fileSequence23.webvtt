00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:00.256 A:middle
can in Swift 4.2.

00:23:01.176 --> 00:23:02.666 A:middle
And this also works for

00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:03.186 A:middle
Hashable.

00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:07.166 A:middle
So now I can have a set of

00:23:07.356 --> 00:23:09.256 A:middle
either Int's or strings as one

00:23:09.256 --> 00:23:09.786 A:middle
example.

00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:11.656 A:middle
OK.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:15.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:16.176 --> 00:23:18.146 A:middle
Now, there are cases where you

00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:19.526 A:middle
really do have to implement

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:22.766 A:middle
equality and Hashing by hand.

00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:25.216 A:middle
So let's look at one example of

00:23:25.216 --> 00:23:25.456 A:middle
that.

00:23:26.616 --> 00:23:27.866 A:middle
Let's say I have a data type

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:30.796 A:middle
that represents a city and it's

00:23:30.796 --> 00:23:32.166 A:middle
got a name, it's got the state

00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:33.456 A:middle
that it's located in, and it has

00:23:33.456 --> 00:23:34.296 A:middle
the population.

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:35.556 A:middle
And let's say that for the

00:23:35.556 --> 00:23:38.006 A:middle
purposes of this example I only

00:23:38.006 --> 00:23:39.536 A:middle
have to compare the name and the

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:41.456 A:middle
state for equality and if I know

00:23:41.456 --> 00:23:42.826 A:middle
those are equal I don't have to

00:23:42.826 --> 00:23:43.926 A:middle
check the population.

00:23:44.616 --> 00:23:46.446 A:middle
So if I let the compiler

00:23:46.446 --> 00:23:48.056 A:middle
synthesize the implementation of

00:23:48.056 --> 00:23:49.706 A:middle
equality here it's going to do

00:23:49.706 --> 00:23:51.046 A:middle
unnecessary work because it's

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:52.006 A:middle
going to be comparing that

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:53.046 A:middle
population field.

00:23:53.776 --> 00:23:55.436 A:middle
But I certainly write it out by

00:23:55.436 --> 00:23:56.976 A:middle
hand and maybe in this case it's

00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:57.636 A:middle
not too bad.

00:23:58.556 --> 00:23:59.796 A:middle
But what about Hashable?
