00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.146 A:middle
in practice have seen from many

00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:01.476 A:middle
projects it's a 2x speedup.

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:04.366 A:middle
And the win comes from observing

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:06.326 A:middle
that because within a Swift

00:10:06.326 --> 00:10:08.286 A:middle
target you have cross-file

00:10:08.286 --> 00:10:09.846 A:middle
visibility, right, that's one of

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:10.896 A:middle
the great features of Swift

00:10:10.896 --> 00:10:11.626 A:middle
where you don't need header

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:11.946 A:middle
files.

00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:13.976 A:middle
There was a lot of redundant

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:15.586 A:middle
work being done by the compiler.

00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:17.056 A:middle
And what we've done is we've

00:10:17.056 --> 00:10:18.346 A:middle
retooled the compilation

00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.136 A:middle
pipeline to reduce a lot of this

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:21.626 A:middle
redundant work and make better

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.516 A:middle
use of the cores on your

00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:22.936 A:middle
machine.

00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:23.996 A:middle
And that's where these speedups

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:24.466 A:middle
come from.

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:26.116 A:middle
If you're interested in more

00:10:26.116 --> 00:10:27.616 A:middle
details there's these two great

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:28.886 A:middle
talks later this week that dive

00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
into how the build process works

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:31.846 A:middle
under the book including more

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:32.906 A:middle
details about where this

00:10:32.946 --> 00:10:34.146 A:middle
performance win comes from.

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:37.906 A:middle
Now this big win comes from

00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:40.526 A:middle
debug builds.

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:44.776 A:middle
I want to focus on how this is

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:47.336 A:middle
surfacing in the Xcode build

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:47.846 A:middle
settings.

00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:49.926 A:middle
Recently we separated out

00:10:49.926 --> 00:10:51.386 A:middle
compilation mode from

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:52.506 A:middle
optimization level.

00:10:53.206 --> 00:10:55.286 A:middle
Compilation mode is how your

00:10:55.286 --> 00:10:56.726 A:middle
project builds.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.566 A:middle
So for release builds the

00:10:58.566 --> 00:10:59.566 A:middle
default is whole module

00:10:59.566 --> 00:11:01.446 A:middle
compilation that means all the
