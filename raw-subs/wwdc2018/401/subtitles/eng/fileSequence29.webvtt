00:28:58.356 --> 00:29:00.796 A:middle
code that is shared between iOS

00:29:00.796 --> 00:29:03.836 A:middle
and macOS and on iOS you want to

00:29:03.836 --> 00:29:05.206 A:middle
do something with UIKit.

00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:06.776 A:middle
On macOS you want to do

00:29:06.776 --> 00:29:08.156 A:middle
something similar in AppKit.

00:29:08.896 --> 00:29:10.466 A:middle
So if you want to do this today

00:29:10.466 --> 00:29:11.816 A:middle
you're going to write a #if

00:29:12.236 --> 00:29:14.186 A:middle
compile time condition check and

00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:15.386 A:middle
then you have to list out those

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:17.216 A:middle
operating systems where UIKit is

00:29:17.216 --> 00:29:17.736 A:middle
available.

00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:20.046 A:middle
So but what you really care

00:29:20.046 --> 00:29:21.836 A:middle
about is not that you're running

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.016 A:middle
on this particular operating

00:29:23.016 --> 00:29:24.606 A:middle
system, but that you can import

00:29:24.606 --> 00:29:25.096 A:middle
UIKit.

00:29:25.626 --> 00:29:27.956 A:middle
So on Swift 4.2 we've added a

00:29:27.956 --> 00:29:30.086 A:middle
has import Build Configuration

00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:32.486 A:middle
Directive so you can better

00:29:32.486 --> 00:29:33.476 A:middle
express your intent.

00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:36.171 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:36.326 --> 00:29:38.026 A:middle
And with the new features of

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.686 A:middle
Swift 4.2, I can actually

00:29:39.686 --> 00:29:40.766 A:middle
improve this code further.

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:43.326 A:middle
So let's say that I'm also going

00:29:43.326 --> 00:29:44.966 A:middle
to explicitly check for AppKit

00:29:45.306 --> 00:29:47.036 A:middle
and then if neither UIKit nor

00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:48.866 A:middle
AppKit is available, for example

00:29:48.866 --> 00:29:50.576 A:middle
if I'm building on Linux, I'm

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:52.356 A:middle
going to use the new #error

00:29:52.546 --> 00:29:53.916 A:middle
build directive to produce a

00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:55.306 A:middle
friendly compile time error

00:29:55.306 --> 00:29:55.796 A:middle
message.

00:29:57.206 --> 00:29:59.376 A:middle
OK, now here's another similar

00:29:59.376 --> 00:30:00.416 A:middle
source of boilerplate.
