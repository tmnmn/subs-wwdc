00:26:59.876 --> 00:27:01.446 A:middle
because they are different

00:27:01.446 --> 00:27:03.866 A:middle
between platforms and they have

00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:04.876 A:middle
different names, different

00:27:04.876 --> 00:27:06.586 A:middle
behavior, so you have to use

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:08.156 A:middle
build configuration checks.

00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:10.486 A:middle
But also they're quite low level

00:27:10.486 --> 00:27:12.806 A:middle
and these common operations that

00:27:12.806 --> 00:27:14.156 A:middle
are not quite so obvious to

00:27:14.156 --> 00:27:14.566 A:middle
implement.

00:27:15.316 --> 00:27:16.886 A:middle
For example, if I want to get a

00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:19.016 A:middle
random number between 1 and 6,

00:27:19.406 --> 00:27:21.446 A:middle
then I might think to just call

00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:23.716 A:middle
this Darwin arc4random function

00:27:23.826 --> 00:27:25.366 A:middle
and then calculate the remainder

00:27:25.366 --> 00:27:26.556 A:middle
of dividing by 6.

00:27:26.836 --> 00:27:27.916 A:middle
But that actually gives you a

00:27:27.916 --> 00:27:29.476 A:middle
result that is not uniformly

00:27:29.476 --> 00:27:31.566 A:middle
distributed between 1 and 6.

00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:35.386 A:middle
So in Swift 4.2 we've added a

00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:37.236 A:middle
new set of APIs to make this

00:27:37.236 --> 00:27:38.086 A:middle
kind of thing easier.

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:41.186 A:middle
First of all, all the numeric

00:27:41.186 --> 00:27:43.296 A:middle
types now define a random method

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:45.576 A:middle
that takes a range and returns a

00:27:45.576 --> 00:27:47.326 A:middle
number uniformly distributed in

00:27:47.326 --> 00:27:47.986 A:middle
that range.

00:27:48.196 --> 00:27:49.816 A:middle
This uses the correct algorithm

00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:51.316 A:middle
and it even works for floats.

00:27:52.516 --> 00:27:58.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:59.096 --> 00:28:00.676 A:middle
For higher level code we've
