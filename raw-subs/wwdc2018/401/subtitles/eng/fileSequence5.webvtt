00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:01.906 A:middle
major updates occur about twice

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:02.386 A:middle
a year.

00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:04.926 A:middle
And Swift 4.2 is a major update

00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:07.026 A:middle
over Swift 4.1 and 4.0.

00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:10.116 A:middle
Now there are in broad strokes

00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:11.736 A:middle
two themes to this release.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:14.686 A:middle
One is a huge focus on developer

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:15.386 A:middle
productivity.

00:05:15.826 --> 00:05:16.946 A:middle
You can see this in a variety of

00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:17.136 A:middle
ways.

00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:19.186 A:middle
The faster builds for projects.

00:05:19.546 --> 00:05:20.826 A:middle
But also just through and

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.876 A:middle
through massive improvement to

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:24.676 A:middle
the core tooling experience from

00:05:24.676 --> 00:05:26.106 A:middle
the Debugger through the Editor.

00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:28.306 A:middle
And the community has also

00:05:28.306 --> 00:05:30.216 A:middle
focused on language improvements

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:32.206 A:middle
that aim to improve common

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:33.796 A:middle
developer workflows, remove

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.386 A:middle
boilerplate.

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:36.936 A:middle
And Apple has continued invested

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.406 A:middle
improvements to the SDK so that

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:41.646 A:middle
the Objective-C APIs better

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:44.226 A:middle
reflect into Swift making better

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.456 A:middle
use of the language and

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:47.006 A:middle
improving your use of our APIs.

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:49.626 A:middle
And the other side there's been

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.766 A:middle
a massive effort on under the

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.736 A:middle
hood improvements and changes to

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.636 A:middle
the runtime towards this binary

00:05:55.636 --> 00:05:58.156 A:middle
compatibility goal, which

00:05:58.156 --> 00:06:01.946 A:middle
culminates in Swift 5, which
