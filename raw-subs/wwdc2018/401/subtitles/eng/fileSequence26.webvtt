00:25:59.686 --> 00:26:01.616 A:middle
random preprocess seed, which is

00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:03.346 A:middle
generated when your app starts.

00:26:05.136 --> 00:26:07.236 A:middle
And we think that it should be

00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:09.136 A:middle
pretty easy to migrate your code

00:26:09.136 --> 00:26:10.746 A:middle
to using the new Hashable

00:26:10.746 --> 00:26:12.256 A:middle
protocol and we encourage you to

00:26:12.256 --> 00:26:12.756 A:middle
do so.

00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:15.016 A:middle
The one caveat to watch out for

00:26:15.016 --> 00:26:16.936 A:middle
is you might have some code

00:26:16.936 --> 00:26:18.746 A:middle
where you're expecting that Hash

00:26:18.746 --> 00:26:20.426 A:middle
values remain constant from

00:26:20.426 --> 00:26:22.296 A:middle
different runs of your app or

00:26:22.296 --> 00:26:23.566 A:middle
that if you iterate over a

00:26:23.566 --> 00:26:25.416 A:middle
dictionary or a set you're going

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:26.636 A:middle
to get the elements in the same

00:26:26.636 --> 00:26:26.976 A:middle
order.

00:26:27.256 --> 00:26:28.726 A:middle
And this is no longer the case

00:26:28.726 --> 00:26:29.656 A:middle
because of that random

00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:30.676 A:middle
preprocess seed.

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:31.816 A:middle
So you will need to fix your

00:26:31.816 --> 00:26:32.116 A:middle
code.

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:35.096 A:middle
And to make this easier we've

00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:37.336 A:middle
added a build setting, the Swift

00:26:37.336 --> 00:26:38.426 A:middle
Deterministic Hashing

00:26:38.426 --> 00:26:39.996 A:middle
Environment Variable, which you

00:26:39.996 --> 00:26:41.666 A:middle
can enable in the scheme editor

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:43.736 A:middle
to temporarily disable that

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:45.256 A:middle
preprocess random seed.

00:26:45.796 --> 00:26:49.466 A:middle
OK, so let's talk about

00:26:49.606 --> 00:26:51.096 A:middle
generating random numbers.

00:26:52.396 --> 00:26:53.656 A:middle
So how do you generate random

00:26:53.656 --> 00:26:54.706 A:middle
numbers in Swift today?

00:26:55.356 --> 00:26:57.916 A:middle
Well, you have to use imported C

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:58.376 A:middle
APIs.

00:26:58.446 --> 00:26:59.876 A:middle
And this is really not ideal

00:26:59.876 --> 00:27:01.446 A:middle
because they are different
