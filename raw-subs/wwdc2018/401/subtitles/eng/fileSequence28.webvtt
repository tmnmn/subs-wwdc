00:27:59.096 --> 00:28:00.676 A:middle
For higher level code we've

00:28:00.676 --> 00:28:03.076 A:middle
added a random element method to

00:28:03.076 --> 00:28:04.196 A:middle
the collection protocol.

00:28:04.786 --> 00:28:07.026 A:middle
And just like min and max this

00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:08.636 A:middle
returns an optional so that if

00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:10.376 A:middle
you pass in an empty collection

00:28:10.526 --> 00:28:11.506 A:middle
you get back no.

00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:14.326 A:middle
And finally there's a shuffled

00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:17.116 A:middle
method on collection where this

00:28:17.116 --> 00:28:18.926 A:middle
gives you an array with a random

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:20.876 A:middle
permutation of the elements of

00:28:20.876 --> 00:28:21.616 A:middle
that collection.

00:28:22.146 --> 00:28:25.216 A:middle
And we think the default Random

00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:26.636 A:middle
Number Generator is a good

00:28:26.636 --> 00:28:27.996 A:middle
choice for most apps.

00:28:28.296 --> 00:28:29.816 A:middle
But you can also implement your

00:28:29.816 --> 00:28:29.883 A:middle
own.

00:28:30.676 --> 00:28:31.836 A:middle
So there's a random number

00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:34.206 A:middle
generator protocol and once you

00:28:34.206 --> 00:28:35.606 A:middle
write a type that conforms to

00:28:35.606 --> 00:28:37.826 A:middle
this protocol you can pass it to

00:28:37.826 --> 00:28:39.326 A:middle
all these APIs that I talked

00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:40.846 A:middle
about which have an additional

00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:43.416 A:middle
overload with a using parameter

00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:44.706 A:middle
that takes a random number

00:28:44.706 --> 00:28:45.236 A:middle
generator.

00:28:46.746 --> 00:28:49.456 A:middle
OK, so we saw these build

00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:51.446 A:middle
configuration checks earlier.

00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:54.346 A:middle
Let's talk some more about them.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:55.896 A:middle
Well, this is a pretty common

00:28:55.896 --> 00:28:56.806 A:middle
pattern in Swift.

00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:58.356 A:middle
You have a little piece of Swift

00:28:58.356 --> 00:29:00.796 A:middle
code that is shared between iOS
