00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:00.926 A:middle
The forums have also worked so

00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:02.476 A:middle
well that we wanted to extend

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:04.586 A:middle
their utility out to supporting

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:06.746 A:middle
the general open source project.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:10.196 A:middle
If you maintain a Swift open

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:11.696 A:middle
source project such as a popular

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:13.526 A:middle
Swift library, you can now use

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:14.906 A:middle
the forums for use to discuss

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:16.436 A:middle
things on that project such as

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:18.506 A:middle
discussions with your users or

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:19.286 A:middle
development.

00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:22.376 A:middle
We've also looked at ways to

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:24.386 A:middle
continue to extend Swift.org to

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:26.016 A:middle
be of general use the community.

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:27.876 A:middle
This week we've moved to hosting

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:28.936 A:middle
the Swift programming language

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:30.486 A:middle
book to swift.org.

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:33.706 A:middle
Located at docs.swift.org, this

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:35.146 A:middle
will be a natural place for us

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.716 A:middle
to extend more documentation for

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.026 A:middle
use by the community.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:42.876 A:middle
Now the really exciting thing

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:45.006 A:middle
about Swift is that people are

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:46.776 A:middle
really thrilled about using it.

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.406 A:middle
And they're talking about it in

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:49.376 A:middle
a variety of places.

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:51.246 A:middle
At Podcasts, Meetups,

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:52.556 A:middle
conferences.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:54.916 A:middle
And we, Apple, thought it was

00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:56.726 A:middle
very important for us to engage

00:03:56.996 --> 00:03:58.166 A:middle
in those places because that's

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.496 A:middle
where a lot of the discussion is

00:03:59.496 --> 00:03:59.966 A:middle
happening.
