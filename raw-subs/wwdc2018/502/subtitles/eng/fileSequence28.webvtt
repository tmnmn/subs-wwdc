00:27:58.966 --> 00:28:01.336 A:middle
connection, or your user may be

00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:03.306 A:middle
on the go, such as on cellular

00:28:03.596 --> 00:28:04.886 A:middle
while viewing the video.

00:28:05.746 --> 00:28:07.236 A:middle
If you're offering multiple

00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:09.846 A:middle
video, multiple media formats,

00:28:10.616 --> 00:28:12.216 A:middle
each codec combination needs

00:28:12.216 --> 00:28:15.826 A:middle
it's own set of tiers.

00:28:16.806 --> 00:28:20.166 A:middle
Not all stalls are due to

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.096 A:middle
network condition.

00:28:22.356 --> 00:28:23.416 A:middle
Let's look at this one.

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.986 A:middle
Stall happened, Error Log tells

00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:28.486 A:middle
you a different story this time.

00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:32.756 A:middle
It says playlist file unchanged

00:28:32.756 --> 00:28:34.956 A:middle
for two consecutive reads.

00:28:35.976 --> 00:28:37.976 A:middle
If you check the Access Log at

00:28:37.976 --> 00:28:40.566 A:middle
the time, player was playing

00:28:40.566 --> 00:28:40.986 A:middle
live.

00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:43.816 A:middle
They indicated the bitrate is

00:28:43.816 --> 00:28:44.456 A:middle
rather low.

00:28:44.996 --> 00:28:48.296 A:middle
The content is about 400K, and

00:28:48.296 --> 00:28:51.116 A:middle
the network bandwidth is 3.7

00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:51.546 A:middle
mbps.

00:28:51.956 --> 00:28:53.646 A:middle
This look like a content

00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:54.586 A:middle
delivery issue.

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:59.156 A:middle
So to reduce or to avoid stalls

00:28:59.156 --> 00:29:01.696 A:middle
due to content delivery, content
