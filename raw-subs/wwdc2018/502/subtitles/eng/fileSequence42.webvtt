00:41:57.426 --> 00:42:00.576 A:middle
player is allowed to choose this

00:42:00.576 --> 00:42:02.596 A:middle
rendition without any special

00:42:02.596 --> 00:42:03.586 A:middle
input from the user.

00:42:04.316 --> 00:42:05.836 A:middle
Most of the time, you want

00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:07.436 A:middle
Autoselect set to yes.

00:42:08.506 --> 00:42:10.066 A:middle
If you don't set this, the

00:42:10.066 --> 00:42:11.156 A:middle
user's going to have to make an

00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:13.036 A:middle
explicit choice to get that

00:42:13.036 --> 00:42:13.546 A:middle
rendition.

00:42:15.276 --> 00:42:17.496 A:middle
The default on the other hand is

00:42:17.496 --> 00:42:19.496 A:middle
what to pick when the user has

00:42:19.496 --> 00:42:20.916 A:middle
not given a preferred language.

00:42:22.216 --> 00:42:23.406 A:middle
Generally this should be the

00:42:23.406 --> 00:42:25.566 A:middle
original language of your video,

00:42:26.066 --> 00:42:27.186 A:middle
and the default must be

00:42:27.186 --> 00:42:28.986 A:middle
autoselectable because the

00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:30.436 A:middle
system has to do the choosing.

00:42:31.136 --> 00:42:33.696 A:middle
Now, this default has nothing to

00:42:33.696 --> 00:42:34.936 A:middle
do with the default video

00:42:34.936 --> 00:42:35.326 A:middle
variant.

00:42:35.326 --> 00:42:37.346 A:middle
This is the default within the

00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:38.426 A:middle
group of renditions.

00:42:39.916 --> 00:42:41.676 A:middle
So, okay, great.

00:42:41.676 --> 00:42:43.166 A:middle
I've got multiple language, but

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:44.496 A:middle
I'd really like to have some

00:42:44.566 --> 00:42:45.496 A:middle
multichannel audio.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.186 A:middle
I've got 5.1.

00:42:48.126 --> 00:42:48.816 A:middle
Okay.

00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:50.086 A:middle
Well the first thing to remember

00:42:50.086 --> 00:42:52.126 A:middle
is not all devices can play

00:42:52.126 --> 00:42:53.156 A:middle
multichannel audio.

00:42:53.516 --> 00:42:56.606 A:middle
So you want to also provide the

00:42:56.606 --> 00:42:58.236 A:middle
user with a stereo option.

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.066 A:middle
And you should think of this
