00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:02.956 A:middle
time for the new video by AV

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:03.936 A:middle
Queue Player.

00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:07.916 A:middle
Create multiple player items,

00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:10.356 A:middle
include them all on the play

00:22:10.356 --> 00:22:10.706 A:middle
queue.

00:22:11.256 --> 00:22:14.356 A:middle
While the player is playing the

00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:17.796 A:middle
current item, when the media

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.186 A:middle
download finishes for the

00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:22.246 A:middle
current item, player will start

00:22:22.246 --> 00:22:23.626 A:middle
downloading for the next one

00:22:24.226 --> 00:22:25.546 A:middle
while the current one is still

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:26.016 A:middle
playing.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.666 A:middle
Thus, the next player item will

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:32.656 A:middle
start playback as soon as

00:22:32.706 --> 00:22:34.916 A:middle
current event play to the end.

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:39.446 A:middle
So do use AV Queue Player to

00:22:39.446 --> 00:22:42.086 A:middle
play multiple items and enqueue

00:22:42.086 --> 00:22:44.256 A:middle

advance.

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:48.266 A:middle
So what's left now?

00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:50.266 A:middle
Buffering time.

00:22:51.446 --> 00:22:54.316 A:middle
First, what determine network

00:22:54.316 --> 00:22:55.086 A:middle
buffering time.

00:22:55.696 --> 00:22:56.566 A:middle
Four factors.
