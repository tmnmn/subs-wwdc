00:23:58.216 --> 00:24:00.256 A:middle
network bandwidths change, and

00:24:00.256 --> 00:24:02.366 A:middle
the content bitrate also change.

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.506 A:middle
In this case, there are a few

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:05.686 A:middle
segments take longer to

00:24:05.686 --> 00:24:06.176 A:middle
download.

00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:08.106 A:middle
Thus, it takes longer to start.

00:24:09.086 --> 00:24:11.946 A:middle
To solve this problem, offering

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:14.916 A:middle
a variant with lower bitrate may

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:15.236 A:middle
help.

00:24:16.896 --> 00:24:19.936 A:middle
Player may decide to switch down

00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:23.586 A:middle
and start up sooner.

00:24:24.336 --> 00:24:26.056 A:middle
When all other information is

00:24:26.056 --> 00:24:29.026 A:middle
absent, the first listed variant

00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:30.946 A:middle
will be your startup variant.

00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:34.636 A:middle
So in this example, same two

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:35.536 A:middle
variants.

00:24:36.216 --> 00:24:37.466 A:middle
The lower bitrate is listed

00:24:37.506 --> 00:24:39.496 A:middle
first with same network

00:24:39.496 --> 00:24:40.106 A:middle
condition.

00:24:40.636 --> 00:24:43.666 A:middle
Player will start faster, start

00:24:45.196 --> 00:24:47.446 A:middle
up faster and also switch up

00:24:47.766 --> 00:24:50.086 A:middle
pretty quickly given the network

00:24:50.086 --> 00:24:52.196 A:middle
bandwidth is sufficient for

00:24:52.196 --> 00:24:52.646 A:middle
playback.

00:24:53.936 --> 00:24:58.466 A:middle
In summary, to reduce network

00:24:58.466 --> 00:25:00.306 A:middle
buffering time, make a wise
