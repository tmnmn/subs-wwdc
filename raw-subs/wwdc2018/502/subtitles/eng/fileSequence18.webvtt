00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:02.836 A:middle
Every player item also offers

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:05.546 A:middle
startup time in the Access Log.

00:18:06.146 --> 00:18:09.416 A:middle
This time is measured by the AV

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.986 A:middle
Player item, represents the time

00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:13.476 A:middle
for buffering only.

00:18:14.506 --> 00:18:15.816 A:middle
It's measured from the start

00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:17.896 A:middle
media downloading until the

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.976 A:middle
first playback is selected to

00:18:19.976 --> 00:18:20.376 A:middle
keep up.

00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:23.366 A:middle
So our user wants the video to

00:18:23.366 --> 00:18:26.326 A:middle
start fast, in at most a few

00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:26.876 A:middle
seconds.

00:18:27.366 --> 00:18:29.546 A:middle
There are ways to achieve that.

00:18:30.236 --> 00:18:33.606 A:middle
One option, we can move some

00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:36.006 A:middle
operations to a different stage

00:18:36.826 --> 00:18:39.886 A:middle
before the user clicks play.

00:18:40.676 --> 00:18:43.776 A:middle
For example, AV Asset creation

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.266 A:middle
and inspection can be moved out.

00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:50.376 A:middle
Key fetching can be moved out.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.456 A:middle
Thus, when the users starts a

00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:57.766 A:middle
video playback, there is less

00:18:57.766 --> 00:18:58.616 A:middle
waiting time.

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:00.886 A:middle
So where do we move those
