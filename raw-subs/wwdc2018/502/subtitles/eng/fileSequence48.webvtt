00:47:58.086 --> 00:48:00.016 A:middle
We're almost done.

00:48:00.436 --> 00:48:02.366 A:middle
Our last bit is about subtitles

00:48:02.366 --> 00:48:03.316 A:middle
and closed captions.

00:48:03.316 --> 00:48:05.946 A:middle
Now, you can probably guess how

00:48:05.946 --> 00:48:06.536 A:middle
this works.

00:48:07.316 --> 00:48:09.676 A:middle
Our variants need to point at

00:48:10.206 --> 00:48:12.316 A:middle
the subtitle and closed caption

00:48:12.446 --> 00:48:13.616 A:middle
groups that we're using.

00:48:14.096 --> 00:48:15.946 A:middle
So we need to add an attribute

00:48:15.946 --> 00:48:18.686 A:middle
to our video variant, and we

00:48:18.686 --> 00:48:20.166 A:middle
need to describe the renditions.

00:48:20.826 --> 00:48:22.496 A:middle
Now, notice that the closed

00:48:22.496 --> 00:48:24.146 A:middle
caption rendition does not have

00:48:24.146 --> 00:48:25.456 A:middle
a URI attribute.

00:48:26.526 --> 00:48:28.456 A:middle
That tells the system that the

00:48:28.456 --> 00:48:30.396 A:middle
closed caption data is found

00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:33.516 A:middle
within the video content, not in

00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:34.396 A:middle
a separate playlist.

00:48:34.946 --> 00:48:38.216 A:middle
So, there you go, the right

00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:38.816 A:middle
thing to do is to give us

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:39.456 A:middle
everything you've got.

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.166 A:middle
See, now you understand better

00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:41.666 A:middle
what I meant.

00:48:42.476 --> 00:48:42.756 A:middle
Okay.

00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:44.836 A:middle
I'd like to quickly summarize

00:48:44.836 --> 00:48:46.186 A:middle
the talk we've given today.

00:48:47.036 --> 00:48:48.236 A:middle
Emil talked about key

00:48:48.236 --> 00:48:49.976 A:middle
performance indicators, about

00:48:49.976 --> 00:48:51.406 A:middle
how to get or compute the values

00:48:51.406 --> 00:48:52.156 A:middle
and what they mean.

00:48:52.776 --> 00:48:55.246 A:middle
And Zhenheng talked about ways

00:48:55.246 --> 00:48:57.476 A:middle
to reduce startup time and how

00:48:57.476 --> 00:49:00.426 A:middle
to go about resolving stalls and
