00:43:58.146 --> 00:44:00.306 A:middle
that the codecs tag indicates

00:44:00.716 --> 00:44:04.096 A:middle
all the different codecs that

00:44:04.096 --> 00:44:06.226 A:middle
can occur within that rendition

00:44:07.516 --> 00:44:07.766 A:middle
group.

00:44:08.086 --> 00:44:09.126 A:middle
Now, notice that we had to

00:44:09.126 --> 00:44:11.506 A:middle
duplicate our video variant.

00:44:12.196 --> 00:44:13.986 A:middle
So now we've got two entries,

00:44:13.986 --> 00:44:16.186 A:middle
one pointing to one audio group,

00:44:16.536 --> 00:44:17.416 A:middle
and the other pointing to the

00:44:17.416 --> 00:44:18.256 A:middle
other audio group.

00:44:18.476 --> 00:44:19.286 A:middle
And you'll see this kind of

00:44:19.286 --> 00:44:21.106 A:middle
duplication again in later

00:44:21.106 --> 00:44:21.596 A:middle
slides.

00:44:22.936 --> 00:44:25.856 A:middle
Well let's say rather than 5.1,

00:44:25.856 --> 00:44:27.566 A:middle
I've got several audio bitrates.

00:44:27.566 --> 00:44:30.616 A:middle
I've got some high bitrate

00:44:30.616 --> 00:44:32.176 A:middle
audio, and I know I need to

00:44:32.176 --> 00:44:35.476 A:middle
provide a low bitrate for some

00:44:35.786 --> 00:44:36.326 A:middle
users.

00:44:36.996 --> 00:44:38.566 A:middle
So in terms of the renditions,

00:44:38.736 --> 00:44:40.386 A:middle
this is similar to what we had

00:44:40.816 --> 00:44:41.386 A:middle
before.

00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:42.636 A:middle
We still got a matrix.

00:44:42.636 --> 00:44:43.676 A:middle
We want to fill it out with

00:44:44.046 --> 00:44:45.506 A:middle
every language for every

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:45.996 A:middle
bitrate.

00:44:47.126 --> 00:44:48.606 A:middle
And since these are both AAC,

00:44:48.606 --> 00:44:49.566 A:middle
they're considered the same

00:44:49.566 --> 00:44:50.266 A:middle
format.

00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:52.426 A:middle
So if I also want to have

00:44:52.886 --> 00:44:55.556 A:middle
another format, all I do is

00:44:55.556 --> 00:44:56.606 A:middle
extend that matrix.

00:44:57.096 --> 00:44:58.306 A:middle
Now, I want to mention that I've

00:44:58.306 --> 00:44:59.256 A:middle
been saying language for

00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
convenience, but you should
