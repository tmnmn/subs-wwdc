00:20:59.806 --> 00:21:01.456 A:middle
Same with the AV plyer.

00:21:02.006 --> 00:21:03.946 A:middle
As soon as the user click play,

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:07.336 A:middle
set rate before the start

00:21:07.336 --> 00:21:11.056 A:middle
downloading for the AV Player

00:21:11.116 --> 00:21:11.406 A:middle
Item.

00:21:12.086 --> 00:21:13.496 A:middle
Thus, the playback will start

00:21:13.496 --> 00:21:16.586 A:middle
automatically as soon as Player

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.176 A:middle
Item has enough to play back.

00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:22.386 A:middle
In summary, set up AV Player

00:21:22.646 --> 00:21:23.366 A:middle
before buffering.

00:21:24.486 --> 00:21:27.476 A:middle
Set AV Player rate before

00:21:28.366 --> 00:21:31.076 A:middle
setting the player item onto the

00:21:31.146 --> 00:21:31.646 A:middle
player.

00:21:31.696 --> 00:21:36.096 A:middle
A lot of application offers a

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:38.626 A:middle
feature to allow the user choose

00:21:39.176 --> 00:21:41.696 A:middle
multiple videos and play one

00:21:41.746 --> 00:21:43.936 A:middle
after another, such as binge

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:45.576 A:middle
watching TV episodes.

00:21:46.756 --> 00:21:48.636 A:middle
We have seen implementation such

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:50.986 A:middle
as one player and one player

00:21:50.986 --> 00:21:52.266 A:middle
item per video.

00:21:52.846 --> 00:21:54.616 A:middle
There's always a startup

00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:56.616 A:middle
buffering time for each new

00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:57.036 A:middle
video.

00:21:57.706 --> 00:21:59.686 A:middle
You may reduce that buffering
