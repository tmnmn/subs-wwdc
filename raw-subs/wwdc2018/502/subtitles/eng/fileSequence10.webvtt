00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.576 A:middle
will add new events to the

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:02.886 A:middle
Access Log, and that is variant

00:10:02.886 --> 00:10:04.916 A:middle
switch, like in this case, or a

00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:05.806 A:middle
playback seek.

00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:08.056 A:middle
But before a new event is added,

00:10:08.126 --> 00:10:10.036 A:middle
the old one becomes immutable,

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:11.926 A:middle
and then we add the new event.

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:13.606 A:middle
Now, keep in mind that while

00:10:13.606 --> 00:10:16.066 A:middle
these values here are constantly

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:17.876 A:middle
updating as playback occurs, so

00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:20.286 A:middle
the values in the last event,

00:10:21.436 --> 00:10:22.586 A:middle
they are not observable

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:22.976 A:middle
properties.

00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:26.966 A:middle
We also mentioned that we care

00:10:26.966 --> 00:10:29.466 A:middle
about media quality.

00:10:29.956 --> 00:10:31.566 A:middle
How do we compute that?

00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:35.326 A:middle
A way to measure if the user is

00:10:35.326 --> 00:10:36.966 A:middle
presented with the best possible

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:38.346 A:middle
media quality is of course to

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.686 A:middle
look at the video bitrate being

00:10:39.686 --> 00:10:40.136 A:middle
served.

00:10:40.636 --> 00:10:42.646 A:middle
Here we don't really care about

00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:44.416 A:middle
the startup time or the stall

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:46.026 A:middle
duration, so let's remove those.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.646 A:middle
So we're left with the playback

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:47.946 A:middle
state.

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:50.066 A:middle
In this example, we see that we

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.426 A:middle
played for a longer time on the

00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:55.536 A:middle
2 megabit variant and less time

00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:56.476 A:middle
at 1 megabit.

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:59.166 A:middle
By time weighting each bitrate,

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:01.326 A:middle
we can obtain a single value of
