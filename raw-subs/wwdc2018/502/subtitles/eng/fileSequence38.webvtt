00:37:59.976 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
thumbnail image, you need to

00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:04.316 A:middle
give us an I-frame playlist, and

00:38:04.356 --> 00:38:06.226 A:middle
the I-frame playlist is also

00:38:06.506 --> 00:38:09.166 A:middle
what allows us to provide images

00:38:09.206 --> 00:38:10.646 A:middle
in fast forward and reverse

00:38:10.646 --> 00:38:13.156 A:middle
playback on your iPad or your

00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:13.526 A:middle
iPhone.

00:38:14.046 --> 00:38:15.616 A:middle
Now in order to talk about

00:38:15.616 --> 00:38:17.526 A:middle
I-frame playlist, we first need

00:38:17.616 --> 00:38:18.986 A:middle
to talk just for a moment about

00:38:18.986 --> 00:38:19.716 A:middle
normal video.

00:38:20.516 --> 00:38:22.286 A:middle
Now, here's a way of visualizing

00:38:22.866 --> 00:38:24.406 A:middle
regular video segments in HLS.

00:38:25.076 --> 00:38:26.796 A:middle
Each segment has content for a

00:38:26.796 --> 00:38:28.136 A:middle
number of frames, so it has a

00:38:28.136 --> 00:38:30.266 A:middle
duration in frames, and it has a

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:31.776 A:middle
particular average bitrate, and

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.346 A:middle
that bitrate varies from segment

00:38:34.866 --> 00:38:36.176 A:middle
to segment.

00:38:36.516 --> 00:38:38.586 A:middle
Now, because of compression

00:38:38.586 --> 00:38:40.096 A:middle
techniques, most frames in a

00:38:40.096 --> 00:38:41.326 A:middle
video can only be decoded

00:38:41.326 --> 00:38:42.756 A:middle
relative to other frames.

00:38:43.676 --> 00:38:45.436 A:middle
But I-frames, the I stands for

00:38:45.436 --> 00:38:47.056 A:middle
intercoded frames, these are

00:38:47.056 --> 00:38:48.536 A:middle
frames that are independently

00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:49.876 A:middle
decodable, and they're the base

00:38:49.876 --> 00:38:51.056 A:middle
frames that allow everything

00:38:51.056 --> 00:38:52.126 A:middle
else to be decoded.

00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:54.846 A:middle
Now, as I've shown you here, you

00:38:54.846 --> 00:38:56.716 A:middle
might have more than one I-frame

00:38:56.716 --> 00:38:58.696 A:middle
in a single segment, and the

00:38:58.696 --> 00:39:02.836 A:middle
I-frames need not be in a, occur
