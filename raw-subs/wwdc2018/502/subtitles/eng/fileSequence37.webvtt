00:36:59.396 --> 00:37:00.626 A:middle
whether we'll be able to keep up

00:37:00.626 --> 00:37:01.306 A:middle
with a stream.

00:37:02.276 --> 00:37:04.276 A:middle
Codecs is what enables us to

00:37:04.276 --> 00:37:06.416 A:middle
filter out things that we can't

00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:08.806 A:middle
play, and resolution allows us

00:37:08.806 --> 00:37:10.156 A:middle
to make good decisions about

00:37:10.156 --> 00:37:11.236 A:middle
which variant to choose.

00:37:12.086 --> 00:37:13.806 A:middle
Remember, we don't read the

00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:15.776 A:middle
media playlists or the media

00:37:15.776 --> 00:37:17.436 A:middle
segments until we have to.

00:37:17.816 --> 00:37:19.246 A:middle
So you need to tell us things

00:37:19.466 --> 00:37:20.846 A:middle
ahead of time in your master

00:37:20.846 --> 00:37:21.406 A:middle
playlist.

00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:25.406 A:middle
So here's a sample of a simple

00:37:25.406 --> 00:37:26.266 A:middle
master playlist.

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.306 A:middle
This playlist allows the player

00:37:28.306 --> 00:37:30.266 A:middle
to adapt to bandwidth changes

00:37:30.266 --> 00:37:31.876 A:middle
and make good choices about

00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:32.816 A:middle
which variant to use.

00:37:33.756 --> 00:37:36.436 A:middle
Now, everything that we've done

00:37:36.436 --> 00:37:38.066 A:middle
here is invisible to the user.

00:37:38.066 --> 00:37:39.576 A:middle
It just makes the stream play

00:37:39.576 --> 00:37:39.896 A:middle
better.

00:37:41.156 --> 00:37:41.506 A:middle
Okay.

00:37:41.986 --> 00:37:43.516 A:middle
Let's look at a common problem.

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:45.546 A:middle
Your stream plays, but you're

00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:46.876 A:middle
not seeing any images in fast

00:37:46.876 --> 00:37:48.186 A:middle
forward, or your not seeing a

00:37:48.186 --> 00:37:49.496 A:middle
thumbnail in the scrubber bar.

00:37:50.826 --> 00:37:52.376 A:middle
Here's the Apple TV scrubber

00:37:52.376 --> 00:37:52.656 A:middle
bar.

00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:54.506 A:middle
You can see how long your

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:55.356 A:middle
content is.

00:37:55.596 --> 00:37:56.586 A:middle
You can see where you are in the

00:37:56.586 --> 00:37:57.826 A:middle
content, where you want to go.

00:37:58.756 --> 00:37:59.976 A:middle
Now, in order to get that

00:37:59.976 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
thumbnail image, you need to
