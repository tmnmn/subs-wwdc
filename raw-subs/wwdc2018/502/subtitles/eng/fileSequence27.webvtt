00:26:58.396 --> 00:27:00.456 A:middle
detailed information on what has

00:27:00.456 --> 00:27:00.886 A:middle
happened.

00:27:01.456 --> 00:27:03.266 A:middle
In this case, it says media file

00:27:03.266 --> 00:27:05.206 A:middle
not received in 15 seconds.

00:27:06.406 --> 00:27:09.056 A:middle
Application checks Access Log to

00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:12.286 A:middle
find out what the AV Player was

00:27:12.346 --> 00:27:14.086 A:middle
playing at the moment when the

00:27:14.086 --> 00:27:14.856 A:middle
stall happened.

00:27:15.846 --> 00:27:17.886 A:middle
It tells you detailed

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:20.046 A:middle
information such as the player

00:27:20.046 --> 00:27:22.746 A:middle
was playing what content and

00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:23.186 A:middle
such URI.

00:27:24.506 --> 00:27:26.036 A:middle
The indicated bitrate is the

00:27:26.036 --> 00:27:27.046 A:middle
content bitrate.

00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:30.656 A:middle
In this case, 36 mbps, and that

00:27:30.656 --> 00:27:31.756 A:middle
is a [inaudible] content.

00:27:32.606 --> 00:27:35.166 A:middle
An observed bitrate is the

00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:36.766 A:middle
current network bandwidth.

00:27:37.066 --> 00:27:39.616 A:middle
In this case is 2.8 mbps.

00:27:40.236 --> 00:27:43.126 A:middle
It's obviously due to the

00:27:43.126 --> 00:27:45.276 A:middle
network bandwidth can't catch up

00:27:45.316 --> 00:27:47.286 A:middle
with the content bitrate.

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:50.536 A:middle
So to deal with variable

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:53.686 A:middle
networks, remember to provide a

00:27:53.686 --> 00:27:54.706 A:middle
full set of bitrate.

00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:57.436 A:middle
Remember some of your users may

00:27:57.436 --> 00:27:58.966 A:middle
have a slower network

00:27:58.966 --> 00:28:01.336 A:middle
connection, or your user may be
