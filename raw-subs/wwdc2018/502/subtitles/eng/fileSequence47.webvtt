00:47:00.336 --> 00:47:02.876 A:middle
But similar to audio, not every

00:47:02.876 --> 00:47:04.586 A:middle
device supports things like

00:47:04.586 --> 00:47:06.516 A:middle
Dolby Vision, so you want to

00:47:06.516 --> 00:47:09.916 A:middle
provide an H.264 variant as a

00:47:09.916 --> 00:47:10.476 A:middle
fallback.

00:47:11.476 --> 00:47:12.586 A:middle
The main thing to remember is

00:47:12.586 --> 00:47:13.806 A:middle
that in each column you want to

00:47:13.806 --> 00:47:15.476 A:middle
have the bitrate form a nice

00:47:15.476 --> 00:47:16.066 A:middle
progression.

00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:19.266 A:middle
Now, this playlist has gotten a

00:47:19.266 --> 00:47:20.876 A:middle
little too big to show on one

00:47:20.876 --> 00:47:21.946 A:middle
slide, so I'm going to split it

00:47:21.946 --> 00:47:22.806 A:middle
over three slides.

00:47:23.276 --> 00:47:25.196 A:middle
This one shows you the H.264

00:47:25.196 --> 00:47:25.686 A:middle
variant.

00:47:26.336 --> 00:47:29.466 A:middle
On this slide, we have the HEVC

00:47:29.466 --> 00:47:29.946 A:middle
variant.

00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:31.906 A:middle
Now, notice everything has a

00:47:31.906 --> 00:47:34.206 A:middle
different video playlist that

00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:36.046 A:middle
it's pointing to, and here's our

00:47:36.046 --> 00:47:37.926 A:middle
Dolby Vision variant, and notice

00:47:37.926 --> 00:47:40.016 A:middle
that everything here has had the

00:47:40.016 --> 00:47:40.956 A:middle
same audio group.

00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:42.976 A:middle
So, again, if we wanted to have

00:47:42.976 --> 00:47:45.216 A:middle
multiple audio formats, we would

00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:47.146 A:middle
need to replicate the video

00:47:47.146 --> 00:47:49.466 A:middle
variants for each audio format.

00:47:49.796 --> 00:47:51.326 A:middle
And again this wouldn't increase

00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:52.516 A:middle
the number of video playlists we

00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:53.206 A:middle
had to have.

00:47:53.646 --> 00:47:54.566 A:middle
It would just increase the

00:47:54.566 --> 00:47:56.046 A:middle
number of entries that we had in

00:47:56.046 --> 00:47:56.666 A:middle
the playlist.

00:47:57.696 --> 00:47:57.836 A:middle
Okay.

00:47:58.086 --> 00:48:00.016 A:middle
We're almost done.
