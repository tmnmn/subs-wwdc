The choice of your variant, the

00:23:01.136 --> 00:23:04.556 A:middle
content bitrate, your playlist

00:23:04.556 --> 00:23:06.696 A:middle
target duration, and of course,

00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:09.276 A:middle
last, the network bandwidth.

00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:13.706 A:middle
Let's take a look a few examples

00:23:13.706 --> 00:23:14.776 A:middle
of buffering time.

00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:18.476 A:middle
First, it's a simple master

00:23:18.476 --> 00:23:19.016 A:middle
playlist.

00:23:19.396 --> 00:23:22.236 A:middle
It specifies an ATP video at

00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:24.386 A:middle
about 5 mbps.

00:23:24.386 --> 00:23:26.656 A:middle
Let's assume the network

00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.986 A:middle
bandwidth is around 6 mbps.

00:23:28.986 --> 00:23:31.436 A:middle
Our target duration is 10

00:23:31.436 --> 00:23:31.896 A:middle
seconds.

00:23:32.886 --> 00:23:35.116 A:middle
In most of the cases, player

00:23:35.186 --> 00:23:38.556 A:middle
item buffers one segment before

00:23:39.446 --> 00:23:41.216 A:middle
it notifies playback it like to

00:23:41.216 --> 00:23:42.526 A:middle
keep up.

00:23:42.636 --> 00:23:46.336 A:middle
However, the same master

00:23:46.336 --> 00:23:48.816 A:middle
playlist, almost the same

00:23:48.816 --> 00:23:51.676 A:middle
network condition, the user may

00:23:51.676 --> 00:23:54.246 A:middle
observe slower startup.

00:23:55.996 --> 00:23:58.216 A:middle
The reason is, remember, the

00:23:58.216 --> 00:24:00.256 A:middle
network bandwidths change, and
