to go about resolving stalls and

00:49:00.426 --> 00:49:01.206 A:middle
other errors.

00:49:01.336 --> 00:49:02.896 A:middle
And I've talked about how to do

00:49:02.896 --> 00:49:03.756 A:middle
master playlists.

00:49:04.216 --> 00:49:06.156 A:middle
I'd like to briefly mention the

00:49:06.156 --> 00:49:07.586 A:middle
HLS validation tools.

00:49:08.266 --> 00:49:10.466 A:middle
They do identify many issues

00:49:10.466 --> 00:49:12.316 A:middle
with master and media playlists,

00:49:12.566 --> 00:49:14.246 A:middle
and it's worth your time to use

00:49:14.246 --> 00:49:14.446 A:middle
them.

00:49:15.616 --> 00:49:17.816 A:middle
As always, you can get more

00:49:17.816 --> 00:49:20.316 A:middle
information from the WWDC app or

00:49:20.366 --> 00:49:21.496 A:middle
the developer website.

00:49:21.946 --> 00:49:22.906 A:middle
That's all we have today.

00:49:23.136 --> 00:49:23.956 A:middle
Thanks very much for your

00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:24.706 A:middle
attention and time.
