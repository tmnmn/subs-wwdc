00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:01.326 A:middle
we can obtain a single value of

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:02.766 A:middle
video quality that we can

00:11:02.766 --> 00:11:04.956 A:middle
compare across sessions.

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:07.226 A:middle
We call this measure a

00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:09.206 A:middle
Time-Weighted Indicated Bitrate,

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.706 A:middle
and computing it is just as

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.656 A:middle
simple as with the total

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:14.266 A:middle
duration.

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:17.496 A:middle
Once again, we get a reference

00:11:17.496 --> 00:11:19.176 A:middle
to the Player Items Access Log.

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:21.076 A:middle
We iterate through the events in

00:11:21.076 --> 00:11:21.526 A:middle
the log.

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:23.526 A:middle
We compute the time weight of

00:11:23.526 --> 00:11:25.026 A:middle
each event with respect to the

00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:26.936 A:middle
total duration watch we computed

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.396 A:middle
earlier, and finally, we sum up

00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:31.126 A:middle
the weighted bitrate value.

00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:33.036 A:middle
Now keep in mind that some of

00:11:33.036 --> 00:11:35.546 A:middle
these properties may not be

00:11:35.546 --> 00:11:36.516 A:middle
initialized, so do the

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:39.206 A:middle
appropriate checks in your code.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.656 A:middle
Another event which you must

00:11:42.656 --> 00:11:44.286 A:middle
absolutely track is of course

00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:45.306 A:middle
playback failure.

00:11:45.866 --> 00:11:47.526 A:middle
To do that, you observe the AV

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:48.796 A:middle
Player item status.

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:51.256 A:middle
If the value ever changes to

00:11:51.256 --> 00:11:52.986 A:middle
false, it means AV Player

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:54.376 A:middle
encountered an unrecoverable

00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:54.746 A:middle
error.

00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:56.926 A:middle
A good way to transform this

00:11:56.926 --> 00:11:58.576 A:middle
observation into a KPI?

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:02.856 A:middle
Well, one way to do it is to
