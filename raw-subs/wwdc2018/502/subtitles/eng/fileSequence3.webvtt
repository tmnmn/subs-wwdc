00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.416 A:middle
What is this session about?

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.846 A:middle
First, we want to establish a

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:05.456 A:middle
common language for discussing

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:06.946 A:middle
streaming quality of service.

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:09.436 A:middle
Second, we want to discuss how

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:11.156 A:middle
to objectively measure your

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.096 A:middle
application streaming

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:12.836 A:middle
performance.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:15.266 A:middle
Third, we want to help you

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:17.796 A:middle
identify and solve some of the

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.746 A:middle
problems that impair streaming

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:20.906 A:middle
quality of service.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.196 A:middle
And finally, we want to get

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:25.606 A:middle
those master playlists right.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.486 A:middle
This is because many of the

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.376 A:middle
problems and issues that we see

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:31.056 A:middle
with streaming quality are

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:33.226 A:middle
actually rooted in the authoring

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:34.626 A:middle
of the master playlist.

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:37.216 A:middle
Before going into detail, let's

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.916 A:middle
begin with a brief overview of

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:40.246 A:middle
an HLS playback session.

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:42.736 A:middle
As you'd expect, it begins with

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
the download of a master

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:44.426 A:middle
playlist.

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:47.396 A:middle
Once the playlist is passed by

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:49.356 A:middle
AV Player, it knows what content

00:03:49.356 --> 00:03:50.176 A:middle
it refers to.

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:51.496 A:middle
In this case, we have two

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.356 A:middle
bitrates, 1 megabit and 2

00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:53.836 A:middle
megabit.

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:55.546 A:middle
AV Player will pick one of

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:57.406 A:middle
these, will go ahead and

00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:58.846 A:middle
download a media playlist

00:03:58.846 --> 00:03:59.816 A:middle
together with additional

00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:01.806 A:middle
artifacts such as keys, and then
