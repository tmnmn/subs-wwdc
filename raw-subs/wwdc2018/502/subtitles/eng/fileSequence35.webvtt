available on the developer

00:35:00.596 --> 00:35:01.256 A:middle
website.

00:35:02.026 --> 00:35:03.316 A:middle
That's all I want to talk about

00:35:03.316 --> 00:35:03.826 A:middle
it today.

00:35:04.606 --> 00:35:06.226 A:middle
Now let's welcome my colleague,

00:35:06.266 --> 00:35:08.806 A:middle
Eryk Vershen, to talk about how

00:35:10.136 --> 00:35:12.006 A:middle
to author the master playlist

00:35:12.676 --> 00:35:13.266 A:middle
the correct way.

00:35:13.796 --> 00:35:14.166 A:middle
Thank you.

00:35:25.046 --> 00:35:25.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Zhenheng.

00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:27.336 A:middle
My name's Eryk Vershen.

00:35:27.336 --> 00:35:28.956 A:middle
I'm an engineer working on HLS

00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:29.566 A:middle
Tools.

00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:31.596 A:middle
We've spoken about how to

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.606 A:middle
measure your performance and

00:35:33.826 --> 00:35:35.406 A:middle
also how to address many of

00:35:35.406 --> 00:35:36.236 A:middle
those concerns.

00:35:36.746 --> 00:35:38.166 A:middle
However, one of the key elements

00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:40.436 A:middle
to successful and error-free

00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:42.656 A:middle
playback experience is to ensure

00:35:42.656 --> 00:35:44.636 A:middle
that your master playlist is

00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:45.566 A:middle
authored correctly.

00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:47.826 A:middle
The master playlist is what

00:35:47.826 --> 00:35:49.216 A:middle
allows the player to make

00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:51.426 A:middle
intelligent decisions both

00:35:51.476 --> 00:35:53.226 A:middle
before and during playback.

00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:55.196 A:middle
So getting it right is critical.

00:35:56.466 --> 00:35:57.176 A:middle
There we go.

00:35:57.176 --> 00:35:57.846 A:middle
That's my advice.

00:35:58.046 --> 00:35:59.246 A:middle
No, I'm just kidding.

00:35:59.646 --> 00:36:01.066 A:middle
I think I need to give you a
