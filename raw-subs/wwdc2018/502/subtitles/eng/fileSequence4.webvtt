00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:01.806 A:middle
artifacts such as keys, and then

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:03.026 A:middle
continue to download media

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:05.216 A:middle
segments until the buffer level

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:06.596 A:middle
is sufficient for playback.

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:10.446 A:middle
When that happens, the AV Player

00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:11.916 A:middle
item will communicate a

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:14.516 A:middle
prediction of playability by

00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:16.176 A:middle
setting the is playback likely

00:04:16.176 --> 00:04:17.766 A:middle
to keep up property to true.

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:20.466 A:middle
If you've preset the AV Player

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:22.125 A:middle
Rate to 1, so you're using the

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:24.026 A:middle
Autoplay feature of a AV Player,

00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:26.426 A:middle
the player will go ahead and

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:27.886 A:middle
start playback immediately.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:29.946 A:middle
We call this Time Interval

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:30.786 A:middle
Startup Time.

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.426 A:middle
From this point on, the wall

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:35.516 A:middle
clock, also known as real time,

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:37.516 A:middle
and the player item time base

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.076 A:middle
will advance at the same speed,

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:41.396 A:middle
with one condition, which is

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:43.786 A:middle
that content must arrive at an

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:46.056 A:middle
equivalent or faster rate than

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.296 A:middle
that which AV Player is

00:04:47.296 --> 00:04:47.926 A:middle
consuming.

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:49.916 A:middle
If that's not the case, AV

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:52.036 A:middle
Player will try and switch down

00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:53.336 A:middle
to the 1 megabit here.

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:55.426 A:middle
If network still cannot keep up

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.446 A:middle
with real time at 1 megabit,

00:04:57.726 --> 00:04:59.276 A:middle
well the buffer will eventually

00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:01.566 A:middle
run dry, and AV Player has no
