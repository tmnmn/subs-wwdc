00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:00.886 A:middle
So where do we move those

00:19:00.886 --> 00:19:01.866 A:middle
operations to?

00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:06.156 A:middle
While your user is viewing the

00:19:06.156 --> 00:19:09.286 A:middle
video catalogue or video info,

00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:11.336 A:middle
it's a good time to create an

00:19:12.356 --> 00:19:15.026 A:middle
inspect AV Asset before the user

00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:17.696 A:middle
decides to play.

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:19.926 A:middle
Now, last year we had introduced

00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:21.446 A:middle
AV Content Key Session API.

00:19:22.346 --> 00:19:25.646 A:middle
This new API decouples the media

00:19:25.646 --> 00:19:27.056 A:middle
load from key fetching.

00:19:27.596 --> 00:19:29.836 A:middle
It gives the application total

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.326 A:middle
control on key management.

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:35.336 A:middle
It offers ways to optimize key

00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:37.416 A:middle
fetching, such as bundling up

00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:39.316 A:middle
multiple key requests back to

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:40.686 A:middle
the key server.

00:19:41.566 --> 00:19:43.346 A:middle
If you happen to adopt AV

00:19:43.346 --> 00:19:45.906 A:middle
Content Key Session, spending a

00:19:45.906 --> 00:19:47.686 A:middle
few hours of engineering hours,

00:19:48.566 --> 00:19:50.886 A:middle
your user will notice a faster

00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:52.356 A:middle
startup time.

00:19:53.476 --> 00:19:56.136 A:middle
So we have moved the AV Asset

00:19:56.186 --> 00:19:58.436 A:middle
creation and key fetching out of

00:19:58.436 --> 00:19:59.316 A:middle
startup time.

00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:03.256 A:middle
Now what's left is mainly the AV
