00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
convenience, but you should

00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:01.876 A:middle
remember that it's the name

00:45:01.876 --> 00:45:03.906 A:middle
attribute which is the unique

00:45:04.466 --> 00:45:05.956 A:middle
attribute, not the language

00:45:06.086 --> 00:45:06.616 A:middle
attribute.

00:45:07.056 --> 00:45:09.286 A:middle
Now, in this playlist I'm not

00:45:09.286 --> 00:45:10.346 A:middle
going to show you the media

00:45:10.346 --> 00:45:10.726 A:middle
tags.

00:45:10.726 --> 00:45:11.776 A:middle
I'm just going to show you the

00:45:11.776 --> 00:45:13.276 A:middle
video variants with their audio

00:45:13.276 --> 00:45:13.876 A:middle
group names.

00:45:14.416 --> 00:45:16.426 A:middle
Now you want your low bitrate

00:45:16.426 --> 00:45:18.006 A:middle
video associated with your low

00:45:18.006 --> 00:45:19.726 A:middle
bitrate audio, and you want you

00:45:19.726 --> 00:45:21.476 A:middle
high bitrate video associated

00:45:21.476 --> 00:45:22.936 A:middle
with your high bitrate audio.

00:45:23.986 --> 00:45:25.506 A:middle
And you'll always want to split

00:45:25.506 --> 00:45:26.346 A:middle
this up like this.

00:45:27.036 --> 00:45:29.316 A:middle
Don't do a situation where you

00:45:29.316 --> 00:45:30.556 A:middle
have a complete set of video

00:45:30.556 --> 00:45:31.866 A:middle
variants associated with your

00:45:31.866 --> 00:45:33.716 A:middle
low bitrate audio and a complete

00:45:33.716 --> 00:45:35.016 A:middle
set of variants associated with

00:45:35.016 --> 00:45:36.156 A:middle
your high bitrate audio.

00:45:36.156 --> 00:45:37.786 A:middle
Because if you do that, you can

00:45:37.786 --> 00:45:39.876 A:middle
be at a high video bitrate and

00:45:39.876 --> 00:45:41.816 A:middle
be bouncing between high and low

00:45:41.816 --> 00:45:42.726 A:middle
audio bitrates.

00:45:43.236 --> 00:45:48.506 A:middle
Now, here I've added in the AC3

00:45:48.586 --> 00:45:49.376 A:middle
content.

00:45:50.006 --> 00:45:51.876 A:middle
Notice that again we had to

00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:54.446 A:middle
duplicate our video variant

00:45:54.446 --> 00:45:56.176 A:middle
entries, but they point to the

00:45:56.176 --> 00:45:57.346 A:middle
same video playlist.

00:45:58.196 --> 00:45:59.926 A:middle
Now, notice also that the

00:45:59.926 --> 00:46:01.996 A:middle
bitrate on the video variants
