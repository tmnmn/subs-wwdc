00:38:58.696 --> 00:39:02.836 A:middle
I-frames need not be in a, occur

00:39:02.836 --> 00:39:03.826 A:middle
at regular intervals.

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.366 A:middle
An I-frame playlist is a

00:39:07.366 --> 00:39:09.036 A:middle
playlist which just points to

00:39:09.036 --> 00:39:10.806 A:middle
the I-frame content, that is

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:12.276 A:middle
only the I-frame data will be

00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:12.926 A:middle
downloaded.

00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:14.786 A:middle
And when we talk about the

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.016 A:middle
duration of an I-frame, we

00:39:16.016 --> 00:39:17.536 A:middle
always mean the time from that

00:39:17.536 --> 00:39:19.626 A:middle
I-frame till the next I-frame.

00:39:20.456 --> 00:39:21.596 A:middle
Now, this particular set of

00:39:21.596 --> 00:39:23.956 A:middle
I-frames, I've shown as

00:39:23.956 --> 00:39:24.976 A:middle
extracted from my normal

00:39:24.976 --> 00:39:26.986 A:middle
content, but you can also make

00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:28.156 A:middle
what we call a high-density

00:39:28.156 --> 00:39:29.066 A:middle
I-frame playlist.

00:39:29.996 --> 00:39:31.376 A:middle
This isn't something just

00:39:31.376 --> 00:39:32.396 A:middle
extracted from your normal

00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:32.886 A:middle
content.

00:39:32.886 --> 00:39:33.696 A:middle
Instead, you make it

00:39:33.946 --> 00:39:35.696 A:middle
deliberately with more evenly

00:39:35.696 --> 00:39:36.846 A:middle
spaced I-frames.

00:39:37.516 --> 00:39:38.556 A:middle
This will allow us to work

00:39:38.556 --> 00:39:38.756 A:middle
better.

00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:40.716 A:middle
It allows us to give a much

00:39:40.716 --> 00:39:42.336 A:middle
smoother result when you're fast

00:39:42.336 --> 00:39:42.736 A:middle
forwarding.

00:39:44.376 --> 00:39:45.576 A:middle
Now, here I'm showing you a

00:39:45.576 --> 00:39:47.096 A:middle
master playlist without I-frame

00:39:47.096 --> 00:39:47.866 A:middle
playlist added.

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:51.956 A:middle
Now, notice that the I-frame

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:53.816 A:middle
playlist has almost exactly the

00:39:53.816 --> 00:39:55.766 A:middle
same tags as the normal

00:39:55.766 --> 00:39:56.336 A:middle
playlist.

00:39:56.946 --> 00:39:58.656 A:middle
The only difference is the

00:39:58.656 --> 00:39:59.906 A:middle
I-frame playlist does not

00:39:59.906 --> 00:40:01.786 A:middle
support the frame rate attribute
