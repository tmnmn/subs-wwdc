00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
Well, we recommend that you use

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:01.996 A:middle
the total duration watched and

00:08:01.996 --> 00:08:04.636 A:middle
compute the stall rate in terms

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:07.476 A:middle
of stalls per unit of time

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:08.986 A:middle
watched, such as stalls per

00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:09.326 A:middle
hour.

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:13.976 A:middle
A stall of 30 seconds is much

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:16.296 A:middle
worse to the user than a stall

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:17.206 A:middle
of one second.

00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:19.296 A:middle
This is why we also care about

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:20.806 A:middle
rebuffering time or stall

00:08:20.806 --> 00:08:21.356 A:middle
duration.

00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:23.716 A:middle
By measuring the time interval

00:08:23.716 --> 00:08:25.026 A:middle
between playback stalled

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.956 A:middle
notification and when the player

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:28.566 A:middle
item time base changes back to

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:31.306 A:middle
1, you can compute an accurate

00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:32.206 A:middle
stall duration.

00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:34.956 A:middle
Again, the total duration can be

00:08:34.956 --> 00:08:37.206 A:middle
normalized using the duration

00:08:37.206 --> 00:08:38.746 A:middle
watched of the session.

00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:40.106 A:middle
Well, you might be wondering at

00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:41.356 A:middle
this point, how do I compute the

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:43.006 A:middle
duration watched of a session?

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:44.826 A:middle
And the answer is, through the

00:08:44.826 --> 00:08:45.636 A:middle
Access Log.

00:08:45.636 --> 00:08:46.596 A:middle
Let's see how we do that.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:49.866 A:middle
So this is a snippet of code.

00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:52.396 A:middle
First, we get a reference to the

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:54.126 A:middle
Access Log from the player item.

00:08:55.096 --> 00:08:57.386 A:middle
We iterate through the events in

00:08:57.386 --> 00:08:59.316 A:middle
the Access Log, and we simply

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:02.156 A:middle
sum up each events duration
