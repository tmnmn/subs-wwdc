00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:00.646 A:middle
Here's what the interface looks

00:41:00.646 --> 00:41:00.986 A:middle
like.

00:41:01.296 --> 00:41:03.846 A:middle
I've got a list of languages,

00:41:03.846 --> 00:41:05.146 A:middle
and the user can select one.

00:41:06.336 --> 00:41:08.786 A:middle
And here's a sample playlist.

00:41:09.036 --> 00:41:10.746 A:middle
Now, notice what we did is we've

00:41:10.746 --> 00:41:13.836 A:middle
added an audio tag, sorry, an

00:41:13.836 --> 00:41:17.356 A:middle
audio attribute onto each of our

00:41:17.356 --> 00:41:19.976 A:middle
video variants, and we've added

00:41:19.976 --> 00:41:21.966 A:middle
a group, the media tags with

00:41:21.966 --> 00:41:22.716 A:middle
group ID's.

00:41:23.126 --> 00:41:27.646 A:middle
The group ID is simply a tag

00:41:27.646 --> 00:41:30.496 A:middle
that allows you to associate the

00:41:30.596 --> 00:41:32.296 A:middle
audio renditions with the video

00:41:32.296 --> 00:41:32.876 A:middle
variants.

00:41:33.546 --> 00:41:34.996 A:middle
So notice there are a number of

00:41:34.996 --> 00:41:37.266 A:middle
differences between the two

00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:38.316 A:middle
audio renditions.

00:41:38.846 --> 00:41:40.266 A:middle
Just as with your variants, we

00:41:40.266 --> 00:41:42.196 A:middle
want you to tell us as much as

00:41:42.196 --> 00:41:43.726 A:middle
you can about your media.

00:41:44.626 --> 00:41:46.216 A:middle
Now, there are two attributes

00:41:46.216 --> 00:41:47.396 A:middle
that people tend to have trouble

00:41:47.396 --> 00:41:49.446 A:middle
with on the media tags, and

00:41:49.446 --> 00:41:51.096 A:middle
that's Default and Autoselect.

00:41:52.306 --> 00:41:52.706 A:middle
Okay.

00:41:53.196 --> 00:41:56.376 A:middle
So Autoselect says that the

00:41:56.376 --> 00:41:57.426 A:middle
media selection code in the

00:41:57.426 --> 00:42:00.576 A:middle
player is allowed to choose this
