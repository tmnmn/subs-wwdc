00:24:58.466 --> 00:25:00.306 A:middle
buffering time, make a wise

00:25:00.306 --> 00:25:01.736 A:middle
choice of initial variant.

00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:04.516 A:middle
Lower content bitrate means

00:25:05.266 --> 00:25:07.676 A:middle
shorter buffering time, but it

00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:09.826 A:middle
is a tradeoff of video quality.

00:25:11.406 --> 00:25:13.486 A:middle
If you are offering multiple

00:25:13.486 --> 00:25:16.366 A:middle
media formats such as HDR and

00:25:16.496 --> 00:25:19.646 A:middle
SDR videos or stereo audio and

00:25:19.646 --> 00:25:22.976 A:middle
multiple-channel audios, make

00:25:22.976 --> 00:25:26.276 A:middle
sure the initial variant for

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:29.246 A:middle
each media format are on similar

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:32.216 A:middle
level of bitrate so your user

00:25:32.216 --> 00:25:33.706 A:middle
will have a similar experience

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:36.166 A:middle
regardless what kind of viewing

00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:37.826 A:middle
setup they have.

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:41.926 A:middle
That's all about reduce startup

00:25:41.926 --> 00:25:42.216 A:middle
time.

00:25:42.746 --> 00:25:43.926 A:middle
Our video has started.

00:25:45.556 --> 00:25:47.566 A:middle
Next, let's talk about stalls.

00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:51.186 A:middle
To be really clear, stalls can

00:25:51.186 --> 00:25:53.396 A:middle
happen, especially when the

00:25:53.396 --> 00:25:55.456 A:middle
network bandwidth is really low.

00:25:56.176 --> 00:25:58.116 A:middle
So in this part of talk, let's

00:25:58.116 --> 00:25:59.796 A:middle
focus on how to investigate

00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:03.096 A:middle
stalls and how to improve or
