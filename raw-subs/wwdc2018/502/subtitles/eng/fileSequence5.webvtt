00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:01.566 A:middle
run dry, and AV Player has no

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:03.006 A:middle
choice here, it needs to stop

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.526 A:middle
playback, event which we call a

00:05:04.526 --> 00:05:04.926 A:middle
stall.

00:05:05.816 --> 00:05:07.246 A:middle
The player will remain in this

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:09.196 A:middle
state not only until data starts

00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:10.776 A:middle
flowing again, but up until

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:11.996 A:middle
there's a sufficient level of

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:13.796 A:middle
buffer for the player item to

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.346 A:middle
trigger another positive

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:16.516 A:middle
playability prediction.

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:18.596 A:middle
After that, playback can

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:19.576 A:middle
continue normally.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:22.166 A:middle
Now let's discuss about

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:24.176 A:middle
quantifying the user experience

00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:25.116 A:middle
for such a session.

00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:27.926 A:middle
We do that by defining a set of

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:29.526 A:middle
Key Performance Indicators or

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:30.396 A:middle
KPIs.

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:32.596 A:middle
We picked five of them that we

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:34.166 A:middle
believe are most representative

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:35.556 A:middle
for HTP Light Streaming.

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.776 A:middle
One question you may ask is how

00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.436 A:middle
much time do my users spend

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:42.996 A:middle
waiting for playback to start.

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:44.256 A:middle
Is it one second?

00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:46.646 A:middle
Is it five seconds or maybe 30

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.166 A:middle
seconds?

00:05:47.486 --> 00:05:49.036 A:middle
This is an essential point in

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:50.486 A:middle
terms of user experience.

00:05:51.336 --> 00:05:53.906 A:middle
Further, playback stalls, like

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:55.616 A:middle
the one we just saw, they are

00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:56.966 A:middle
disruptive to the user.

00:05:57.076 --> 00:05:59.156 A:middle
We care both about how often

00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:00.936 A:middle
they occur, but maybe more
