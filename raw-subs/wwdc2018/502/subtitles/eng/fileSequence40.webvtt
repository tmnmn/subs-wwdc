00:39:59.906 --> 00:40:01.786 A:middle
support the frame rate attribute

00:40:02.096 --> 00:40:02.886 A:middle
because it doesn't make any

00:40:02.886 --> 00:40:04.136 A:middle
sense in that context.

00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:06.166 A:middle
Now, a good test for your

00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:07.936 A:middle
I-frame playlist is to try and

00:40:07.936 --> 00:40:08.746 A:middle
play it directly.

00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:11.376 A:middle
That is, take the URI of your

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:13.116 A:middle
I-frame playlist and paste it

00:40:13.116 --> 00:40:13.846 A:middle
into Safari.

00:40:14.316 --> 00:40:16.496 A:middle
It should play at 1X speed, and

00:40:16.496 --> 00:40:18.136 A:middle
you should see the I-frames

00:40:18.136 --> 00:40:20.916 A:middle
displayed one after another in a

00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:22.216 A:middle
slowly changing sequence.

00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:24.886 A:middle
Now also I want to point out the

00:40:24.886 --> 00:40:26.266 A:middle
difference in the bitrate.

00:40:27.036 --> 00:40:28.516 A:middle
Notice that the I-frame bitrate

00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:30.266 A:middle
is much lower than the normal

00:40:30.266 --> 00:40:30.796 A:middle
bitrate.

00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:33.806 A:middle
That should always be the case.

00:40:34.256 --> 00:40:36.326 A:middle
Now, speaking of bitrates, we've

00:40:36.616 --> 00:40:39.366 A:middle
defined how to compute the peak

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.766 A:middle
bitrate in the HLS

00:40:40.766 --> 00:40:41.616 A:middle
specification.

00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:43.976 A:middle
Make sure you do it that way.

00:40:43.976 --> 00:40:44.986 A:middle
Otherwise, you may get that

00:40:45.086 --> 00:40:46.616 A:middle
segment exceeds playlist,

00:40:46.616 --> 00:40:49.066 A:middle
exceeds specified bandwidth

00:40:49.066 --> 00:40:49.436 A:middle
error.

00:40:50.026 --> 00:40:52.306 A:middle
Now, we're going to move away

00:40:52.306 --> 00:40:54.316 A:middle
from video and talk about audio

00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:54.986 A:middle
for a little bit.

00:40:55.426 --> 00:40:57.046 A:middle
Now the most common question is

00:40:57.046 --> 00:40:57.936 A:middle
how do I support multiple

00:40:57.936 --> 00:40:58.606 A:middle
languages?

00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:00.646 A:middle
Here's what the interface looks
