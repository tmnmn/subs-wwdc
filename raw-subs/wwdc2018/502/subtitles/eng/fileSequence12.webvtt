00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:02.856 A:middle
Well, one way to do it is to

00:12:03.026 --> 00:12:04.636 A:middle
look at the percentage of failed

00:12:04.636 --> 00:12:06.526 A:middle
sessions with respect to total

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:07.436 A:middle
sessions, but there might be

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
other ways to do it.

00:12:08.856 --> 00:12:10.636 A:middle
One thing I want to stress here

00:12:10.636 --> 00:12:12.596 A:middle
is that not all errors in your

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:14.246 A:middle
stream may be fatal.

00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:16.316 A:middle
Some may impact media quality

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:18.066 A:middle
while some might not even be

00:12:18.066 --> 00:12:19.386 A:middle
perceivable by the user.

00:12:19.676 --> 00:12:21.046 A:middle
But nonetheless, if there are

00:12:21.046 --> 00:12:23.806 A:middle
errors, they convey that there

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:25.656 A:middle
is an issue with your stream.

00:12:25.876 --> 00:12:29.286 A:middle
So how do I get more insights on

00:12:29.286 --> 00:12:30.176 A:middle
the stream, right, what

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:30.626 A:middle
happened?

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:32.986 A:middle
And the answer is from the

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:34.586 A:middle
Player Item Error Log.

00:12:35.436 --> 00:12:37.046 A:middle
The AV Player Item Error Log.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.756 A:middle
The Error Log conveys failures

00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:40.186 A:middle
with varying degrees of user

00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:40.636 A:middle
impact.

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.626 A:middle
It works in a similar fashion as

00:12:43.836 --> 00:12:45.446 A:middle
the Access Log except that

00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:47.426 A:middle
events represent error rather

00:12:47.426 --> 00:12:48.806 A:middle
than player access states.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.766 A:middle
They cover various areas, such

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:54.586 A:middle
as delivery issues, network

00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:56.416 A:middle
issues, content authoring

00:12:56.416 --> 00:12:57.476 A:middle
errors, and so on.

00:12:57.666 --> 00:12:59.476 A:middle
For instance, they can give you

00:12:59.476 --> 00:13:01.076 A:middle
an insight on why a stall
