00:24:00.226 --> 00:24:01.916 A:middle
and I'll click the options

00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:03.366 A:middle
button next to my test target.

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:06.226 A:middle
Finally, I'll select the execute

00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:08.796 A:middle
in parallel checkbox and that's

00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:10.046 A:middle
all I need to do to enable

00:24:10.046 --> 00:24:10.856 A:middle
parallel testing.

00:24:11.896 --> 00:24:13.176 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and run our

00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:15.016 A:middle
tests now by choosing product

00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:19.576 A:middle
tests.

00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:20.816 A:middle
So, I want you to look at the

00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:21.236 A:middle
doc.

00:24:21.946 --> 00:24:23.806 A:middle
Xcode launches multiple copies

00:24:23.806 --> 00:24:25.736 A:middle
of our Mac app to run our unit

00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:26.636 A:middle
tests in parallel.

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:28.666 A:middle
So, great, it looks like that

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:29.166 A:middle
finished.

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.086 A:middle
So, now, let's go back to the

00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:33.346 A:middle
report and select the most

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:34.016 A:middle
recent report.

00:24:35.676 --> 00:24:37.666 A:middle
So, whereas previously, our test

00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:39.746 A:middle
took 14 seconds to run, now they

00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:40.916 A:middle
only take 5 seconds.

00:24:41.316 --> 00:24:42.336 A:middle
So, just by enabling

00:24:42.336 --> 00:24:43.516 A:middle
parallelization, we've seen the

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:45.276 A:middle
greater than 50% improvement in

00:24:45.276 --> 00:24:46.376 A:middle
test execution time.

00:24:47.516 --> 00:24:53.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:55.566 A:middle
So, the Solar System app isn't

00:24:55.566 --> 00:24:57.806 A:middle
just available for the Mac, it

00:24:57.806 --> 00:24:59.276 A:middle
also has an iOS companion.

00:24:59.276 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
And one of my responsibilities
