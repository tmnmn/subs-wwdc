00:24:59.276 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
And one of my responsibilities

00:25:01.716 --> 00:25:03.656 A:middle
was to write a UI test suite to

00:25:03.656 --> 00:25:05.236 A:middle
exercise the various screens of

00:25:05.236 --> 00:25:06.406 A:middle
my iOS app.

00:25:07.076 --> 00:25:08.196 A:middle
Now I already enabled

00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:10.206 A:middle
parallelization for the iOS

00:25:10.206 --> 00:25:11.986 A:middle
scheme, so I'll go ahead and

00:25:11.986 --> 00:25:12.906 A:middle
just switch to that now.

00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:18.006 A:middle
And then I'll run tests by

00:25:18.006 --> 00:25:20.006 A:middle
choosing product, test.

00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:24.346 A:middle
Now we'll go ahead and switch

00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:25.466 A:middle
over to the simulator.

00:25:26.466 --> 00:25:28.566 A:middle
So, here, you can see that Xcode

00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:30.226 A:middle
has created multiple clones of

00:25:30.226 --> 00:25:31.596 A:middle
the simulator that I selected,

00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:34.646 A:middle
and these clones are named after

00:25:34.646 --> 00:25:36.776 A:middle
the original simulator so that

00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:38.016 A:middle
they're easy to identify.

00:25:39.136 --> 00:25:41.666 A:middle
And on each simulator, Xcode has

00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:44.396 A:middle
launched a test runner and each

00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:45.946 A:middle
runner is executing a different

00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:46.926 A:middle
test class in my suite.
