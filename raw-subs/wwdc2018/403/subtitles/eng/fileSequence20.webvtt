00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:01.476 A:middle
instead of distributing

00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:03.016 A:middle
individual test methods to the

00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:03.446 A:middle
runners.

00:20:04.626 --> 00:20:05.716 A:middle
There are a couple reasons for

00:20:05.716 --> 00:20:06.216 A:middle
this.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.126 A:middle
First, there may be hidden

00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:10.596 A:middle
dependencies between the tests

00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:12.356 A:middle
in a class, like Honza talked

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:12.956 A:middle
about earlier.

00:20:13.886 --> 00:20:15.446 A:middle
If Xcode were to take the tests

00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:17.476 A:middle
in a class and distribute them

00:20:17.476 --> 00:20:19.196 A:middle
to different runners, it could

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:20.536 A:middle
lead to hard to diagnose test

00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:21.166 A:middle
failures.

00:20:21.606 --> 00:20:25.296 A:middle
Second, each test class has a

00:20:25.916 --> 00:20:27.606 A:middle
class level set up and tear down

00:20:27.736 --> 00:20:29.416 A:middle
method, which may perform

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:30.516 A:middle
expensive computation.

00:20:31.516 --> 00:20:32.906 A:middle
By limiting the tests in a class

00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:35.616 A:middle
to a single runner, XE tests

00:20:35.646 --> 00:20:37.336 A:middle
only has to invoke these methods

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.166 A:middle
once, which can save precious

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:39.456 A:middle
time.

00:20:40.086 --> 00:20:43.806 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about some

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:45.756 A:middle
specifics to parallel testing on

00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:46.496 A:middle
the simulator.

00:20:48.076 --> 00:20:49.596 A:middle
When you run tests in parallel

00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:51.856 A:middle
on the simulator, Xcode starts

00:20:51.856 --> 00:20:53.066 A:middle
by taking the simulator that

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:55.236 A:middle
you've selected and creating

00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:57.086 A:middle
multiple distinct copies or

00:20:57.086 --> 00:20:57.716 A:middle
clones of it.

00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
These clones are identical to
