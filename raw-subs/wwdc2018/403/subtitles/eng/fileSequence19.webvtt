00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:01.106 A:middle
session from 2016, where we go

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:03.616 A:middle
into even more detail.

00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:05.656 A:middle
So, now that we understand how

00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:07.396 A:middle
our tests execute, we can

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.046 A:middle
finally talk about how Xcode

00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:10.026 A:middle
runs them in parallel.

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:13.336 A:middle
Just like before, Xcode will

00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:15.566 A:middle
launch a test runner to execute

00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:17.976 A:middle
our tests but instead of just

00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:20.236 A:middle
launching a single runner, Xcode

00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:22.006 A:middle
will launch multiple runners,

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:24.396 A:middle
each of which executes a subset

00:19:24.436 --> 00:19:26.406 A:middle
of the tests.

00:19:26.406 --> 00:19:28.426 A:middle
In fact, Xcode will dynamically

00:19:28.426 --> 00:19:29.766 A:middle
distribute tests to the runners

00:19:30.346 --> 00:19:31.446 A:middle
in order to get the best

00:19:31.446 --> 00:19:32.706 A:middle
utilization of the course on

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:33.296 A:middle
your machine.

00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:36.556 A:middle
Let's go into more detail.

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.876 A:middle
When Xcode distributes tests to

00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:41.856 A:middle
the runners, it does so by

00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:42.146 A:middle
class.

00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:45.046 A:middle
Each runner receives a test

00:19:45.046 --> 00:19:46.986 A:middle
class to execute and it'll

00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:48.756 A:middle
execute that test class before

00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:50.196 A:middle
going on to execute another one.

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:52.676 A:middle
And then testing finishes once

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
all the classes have executed.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:58.016 A:middle
Now you might be wondering why

00:19:58.016 --> 00:19:59.856 A:middle
Xcode distributes tests by class
