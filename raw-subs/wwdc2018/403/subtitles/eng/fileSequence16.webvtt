00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:01.206 A:middle
order to shorten this critical

00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:02.636 A:middle
part of the development cycle.

00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:04.946 A:middle
So, last year, we introduced a

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:08.156 A:middle
feature in Xcode 9 to help you

00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:10.096 A:middle
run tests faster, it's called

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:11.536 A:middle
Parallel Destination Testing.

00:16:12.336 --> 00:16:13.906 A:middle
This is the ability to run all

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.376 A:middle
of your tests on multiple

00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:17.166 A:middle
destinations at the same time.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.406 A:middle
And you do this from the command

00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:20.946 A:middle
line by passing multiple

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.676 A:middle
destinations specifiers to

00:16:22.676 --> 00:16:23.376 A:middle
xcodebuild.

00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:27.066 A:middle
Previously, if you were to run

00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:28.726 A:middle
your tests, let's say on an

00:16:28.826 --> 00:16:31.926 A:middle
iPhone X and an iPad, xcodebuild

00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:33.466 A:middle
would run all of the tests on

00:16:33.466 --> 00:16:35.466 A:middle
the iPhone X and then all of the

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.646 A:middle
tests on the iPad.

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.986 A:middle
Neither device would be running

00:16:38.986 --> 00:16:42.466 A:middle
tests at the same time.

00:16:42.466 --> 00:16:44.016 A:middle
But in Xcode 9, we changed this

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.896 A:middle
behavior so that by default,

00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:47.696 A:middle
tests run concurrently on the

00:16:47.696 --> 00:16:49.556 A:middle
devices and this can

00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:50.946 A:middle
dramatically shorten the overall

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:54.406 A:middle
execution time, which is great.

00:16:54.586 --> 00:16:55.556 A:middle
However, there are some

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.076 A:middle
limitations to this approach.

00:16:58.436 --> 00:17:00.816 A:middle
First, it's only beneficial if
