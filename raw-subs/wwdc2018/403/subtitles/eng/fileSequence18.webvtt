00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:01.636 A:middle
Now in order to tell you about

00:18:01.636 --> 00:18:03.076 A:middle
how Xcode runs your tests in

00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:04.836 A:middle
parallel, we first have to talk

00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.606 A:middle
about how your tests execute at

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:10.646 A:middle
all, what happens at runtime.

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
Let's start with unit tests.

00:18:13.036 --> 00:18:14.996 A:middle
Your unit tests get compiled

00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:16.366 A:middle
into a test bundle.

00:18:17.606 --> 00:18:20.066 A:middle
At runtime, Xcode launches an

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.636 A:middle
instance of your app which

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:23.126 A:middle
serves as a test runner.

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:26.726 A:middle
The runner loads the test bundle

00:18:26.726 --> 00:18:29.786 A:middle
and executes all of its tests,

00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:30.936 A:middle
so that's how unit tests

00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:31.466 A:middle
execute.

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:33.156 A:middle
What about UI tests?

00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:35.416 A:middle
For UI, tests the story is

00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:35.916 A:middle
similar.

00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:37.866 A:middle
Your tests still get compiled

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.186 A:middle
into a bundle, but the bundle is

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.786 A:middle
loaded by a custom app that

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:42.736 A:middle
Xcode creates.

00:18:43.386 --> 00:18:45.126 A:middle
Your app no longer runs the

00:18:45.126 --> 00:18:45.456 A:middle
tests.

00:18:46.636 --> 00:18:48.846 A:middle
Instead, the tests automate your

00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:51.296 A:middle
app by launching it and

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.736 A:middle
interacting with different parts

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:53.106 A:middle
of its UI.

00:18:55.186 --> 00:18:56.196 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:18:56.196 --> 00:18:57.926 A:middle
about this process, I'd

00:18:57.926 --> 00:18:58.786 A:middle
