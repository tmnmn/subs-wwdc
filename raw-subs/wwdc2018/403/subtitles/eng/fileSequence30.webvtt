00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.126 A:middle
out our session on Friday hosted

00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:01.536 A:middle
by my colleague Stuart and Brian

00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:01.826 A:middle
[assumed spellings].

00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:05.226 A:middle
You won't want to miss it.

00:30:05.496 --> 00:30:07.486 A:middle
To wrap up, we started today's

00:30:07.486 --> 00:30:09.846 A:middle
talk with code coverage and the

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.306 A:middle
new improvements to performance

00:30:11.306 --> 00:30:11.996 A:middle
and accuracy.

00:30:13.346 --> 00:30:15.146 A:middle
Next, we talked about new test

00:30:15.316 --> 00:30:17.056 A:middle
selection and ordering features,

00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:18.706 A:middle
which allow you to control

00:30:18.706 --> 00:30:21.096 A:middle
exactly which tests run, as well

00:30:21.136 --> 00:30:22.116 A:middle
as the order in which they're

00:30:22.116 --> 00:30:22.506 A:middle
run.

00:30:23.786 --> 00:30:25.216 A:middle
And finally, we talked about

00:30:25.216 --> 00:30:26.566 A:middle
Parallel Distributed Testing,

00:30:27.066 --> 00:30:28.176 A:middle
which allows you to distribute

00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:29.756 A:middle
test classes between different

00:30:29.756 --> 00:30:31.406 A:middle
runners to execute them in

00:30:31.406 --> 00:30:31.896 A:middle
parallel.

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:34.616 A:middle
For more information, I'd

00:30:34.616 --> 00:30:35.736 A:middle
encourage you to download our

00:30:35.736 --> 00:30:37.596 A:middle
slides from developer.apple.com

00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:39.256 A:middle
and come see us in the labs

00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:40.026 A:middle
later this afternoon.

00:30:41.156 --> 00:30:42.746 A:middle
Have a great WWDC, everyone.

00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:45.000 A:middle
