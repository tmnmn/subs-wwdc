00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:01.656 A:middle
In Xcode 9.3, however, we got it

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:02.706 A:middle
down to less than a half a

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.716 A:middle
second, which is more than 95%

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:05.276 A:middle
faster.

[ Applause ]

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:13.816 A:middle
But we also wanted to make the

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:16.206 A:middle
coverage file smaller, as Xcode

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:17.546 A:middle
can potentially write out many

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:19.026 A:middle
of them, if you run your test

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.516 A:middle
often, as you should, so I'm

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:22.796 A:middle
happy to say that here, the

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.046 A:middle
improvements are just as

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:25.246 A:middle
dramatic.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.826 A:middle
Xcode 9's coverage files were

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.486 A:middle
over 200 megabytes in size.

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.866 A:middle
And this is a lot but remember

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.246 A:middle
that we're talking about a large

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:35.096 A:middle
project with thousands of source

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:35.596 A:middle
files.

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:39.956 A:middle
But files written by Xcode 9.3

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:41.586 A:middle
were less than a tenth of that.

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:48.736 A:middle
I'm sure you appreciate this if

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:49.926 A:middle
you maintain a continuous

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:51.806 A:middle
integration machine or if you're

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.466 A:middle
just running low on disk space.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:55.796 A:middle
But the best part is that not

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:57.086 A:middle
only are the coverage files

00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:59.346 A:middle
smaller and faster to read and

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
write, they're also more
