To tell you all about the new

00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:01.926 A:middle
parallel testing features in

00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:03.516 A:middle
Xcode, I would like to welcome

00:15:03.516 --> 00:15:04.566 A:middle
Ethan Vaughan to the stage.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:04.976 A:middle
Ethan.

[ Applause ]

00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:13.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Honza.

00:15:14.926 --> 00:15:16.506 A:middle
So, many of you have a

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:18.346 A:middle
development cycle that looks

00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:19.066 A:middle
like this.

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.686 A:middle
You write some code, you debug

00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:23.916 A:middle
it, and then you run your tests

00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:25.326 A:middle
before you commit and push your

00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:26.796 A:middle
changes to the repository.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.386 A:middle
By running your tests before you

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.386 A:middle
push, you can catch regressions

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:32.836 A:middle
before they ever make it into a

00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:32.976 A:middle
build.

00:15:35.256 --> 00:15:37.456 A:middle
However, one of the bottlenecks

00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:39.476 A:middle
in this process can be just how

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:42.016 A:middle
long it takes to run your tests.

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:43.616 A:middle
Some of you have test suites

00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:45.296 A:middle
that take on the order of 30

00:15:45.296 --> 00:15:47.016 A:middle
minutes to hours to run.

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:49.046 A:middle
And if you have to wait that

00:15:49.046 --> 00:15:50.826 A:middle
long before you can confidently

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:52.746 A:middle
land your work, that represents

00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:54.026 A:middle
a serious bottleneck in your

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:54.536 A:middle
workflow.

00:15:55.916 --> 00:15:57.036 A:middle
We want to make sure that your

00:15:57.036 --> 00:15:59.736 A:middle
tests run as fast as possible in

00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:01.206 A:middle
order to shorten this critical
