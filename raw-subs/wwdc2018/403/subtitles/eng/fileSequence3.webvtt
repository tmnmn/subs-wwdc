00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
write, they're also more

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
accurate than ever before.

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:05.056 A:middle
One example of this is header

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:05.606 A:middle
files.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.246 A:middle
Xcode 9 didn't correctly collect

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.396 A:middle
and show coverage in header

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:11.666 A:middle
files and this was a problem for

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.106 A:middle
a code basis that used C++ as in

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:15.546 A:middle
that language, you can have a

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.276 A:middle
good portion of your executable

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:18.506 A:middle
code in headers.

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:20.826 A:middle
So, if you're one of the people

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.106 A:middle
affected, you'll be happy to

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:24.006 A:middle
hear that Xcode now correctly

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.296 A:middle
gathers and presents code

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:27.316 A:middle
coverage for both implementation

00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:28.336 A:middle
and header files.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:30.916 A:middle
Now let's talk about code

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.006 A:middle
coverage features.

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:34.686 A:middle
The first one is target

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:35.346 A:middle
selection.

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:38.466 A:middle
This is a new option to control

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.876 A:middle
not only whether code coverage

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:42.136 A:middle
is enabled or disabled but when

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.506 A:middle
it's enabled, you actually

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:46.416 A:middle
control which targets are

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:46.886 A:middle
included.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.476 A:middle
This can be important if your

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:50.816 A:middle
project builds third-party

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:52.516 A:middle
dependencies that you're not

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:54.156 A:middle
expected to cover by your tests

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:55.986 A:middle
or if you work at a company

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.906 A:middle
where another team supplies you

00:03:57.906 --> 00:03:59.176 A:middle
with a framework that they

00:03:59.176 --> 00:03:59.916 A:middle
already tested.
