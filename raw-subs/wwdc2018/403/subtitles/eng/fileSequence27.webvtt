00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
in the test report, as well as

00:27:01.106 --> 00:27:02.616 A:middle
how our classes are distributed

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:03.586 A:middle
in the test log.

00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:07.486 A:middle
Then we saw Xcode launch

00:27:07.486 --> 00:27:09.126 A:middle
multiple instances of our Mac

00:27:09.126 --> 00:27:10.856 A:middle
app to run unit tests in

00:27:10.856 --> 00:27:11.486 A:middle
parallel.

00:27:12.866 --> 00:27:14.736 A:middle
And finally, we saw multiple

00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:16.666 A:middle
clones of the simulator running

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:20.286 A:middle
our UI tests in parallel.

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:21.846 A:middle
Like I mentioned earlier,

00:27:22.386 --> 00:27:24.136 A:middle
xcodebuild has great support for

00:27:24.136 --> 00:27:25.526 A:middle
parallel testing as well.

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:27.766 A:middle
We've added some new command

00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:29.136 A:middle
line options that allow you to

00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:30.806 A:middle
control this behavior and I'd

00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:31.966 A:middle
like to point out two of those

00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:32.166 A:middle
now.

00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:35.206 A:middle
First, we have

00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:36.826 A:middle
parallel-testing-worker-count,

00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:38.416 A:middle
which allows you to control the

00:27:38.416 --> 00:27:40.056 A:middle
exact number of workers or

00:27:40.056 --> 00:27:42.106 A:middle
runners that Xcode should launch

00:27:42.136 --> 00:27:42.946 A:middle
during parallel testing.

00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:46.326 A:middle
Normally, Xcode tries to

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:47.786 A:middle
determine an optimal number of

00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:49.336 A:middle
runners based off of the

00:27:49.336 --> 00:27:51.036 A:middle
resources of your machine, as

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:51.866 A:middle
well as the workload.

00:27:52.956 --> 00:27:54.106 A:middle
This means that on a higher core

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:55.356 A:middle
machine, you will likely

00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:56.576 A:middle
experience more runners.

00:27:58.126 --> 00:27:59.436 A:middle
But if you find that the default

00:27:59.436 --> 00:28:00.606 A:middle
number isn't working well for
