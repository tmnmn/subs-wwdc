00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.126 A:middle
But if that's not what you

00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
wanted, you have to go through

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.906 A:middle
all those schemes and disable

00:12:02.906 --> 00:12:04.426 A:middle
the test there manually.

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
So, in Xcode 10, we're

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.176 A:middle
introducing a new mode for

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:09.516 A:middle
schemes to instead, encode the

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:10.566 A:middle
tests to run.

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:13.746 A:middle
If you switch your scheme to

00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:15.756 A:middle
that mode, only the test that

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:18.526 A:middle
you hand pick will run in that

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:21.026 A:middle
scheme.

00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:22.486 A:middle
You control this mode in the

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:24.026 A:middle
scheme editors test action,

00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:26.306 A:middle
where in the list of test

00:12:26.306 --> 00:12:27.806 A:middle
targets, there's a new options

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:29.346 A:middle
pop-up, where you can declare

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:30.316 A:middle
whether the scheme should

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:31.796 A:middle
automatically include new tests

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:32.266 A:middle
or not.

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:34.956 A:middle
This way, some of your schemes

00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:36.526 A:middle
can continue to run any new

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:38.206 A:middle
tests you write, while other

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.136 A:middle
schemes will only run a list of

00:12:40.136 --> 00:12:43.386 A:middle
hand-picked tests.

00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:45.866 A:middle
So, we've discussed how we can

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.016 A:middle
better control which of our

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.696 A:middle
tests run and when, but the

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:50.386 A:middle
order of our tests can be

00:12:50.386 --> 00:12:51.286 A:middle
significant too.

00:12:52.816 --> 00:12:55.376 A:middle
By default, tests in Xcode are

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:56.536 A:middle
sorted by their name.

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:58.776 A:middle
This means that unless you

00:12:58.776 --> 00:13:00.486 A:middle
rename your tests, they will
