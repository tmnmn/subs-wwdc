00:09:59.496 --> 00:10:03.526 A:middle
corresponding test file and I

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:04.916 A:middle
will add a new test.

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:09.126 A:middle
This test just puts a couple of

00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:11.896 A:middle
messages into a local server and

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:12.966 A:middle
then I call, get recent

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:14.476 A:middle
messages, on it to verify that

00:10:14.476 --> 00:10:15.906 A:middle
it returns what I'm expecting.

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:19.696 A:middle
So, with the new test added, I

00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:21.126 A:middle
will rerun my tests one more

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:21.476 A:middle
time.

00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:27.356 A:middle
So, great, the test finished.

00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:28.826 A:middle
I'll go to the coverage report

00:10:29.346 --> 00:10:32.836 A:middle
again and now when I focus on my

00:10:32.836 --> 00:10:33.986 A:middle
framework, I can see that it's

00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.286 A:middle
covered at 100%.

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:36.786 A:middle
This is exactly what I wanted.

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:40.816 A:middle
So, we saw how I used the target

00:10:40.816 --> 00:10:42.336 A:middle
selection feature to only focus

00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:43.626 A:middle
on some of the targets.

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:45.806 A:middle
Then I used the coverage report

00:10:45.806 --> 00:10:47.456 A:middle
to know exactly which file to

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:48.126 A:middle
focus on.

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:50.076 A:middle
And finally, I used the code

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.236 A:middle
coverage integration in the

00:10:51.236 --> 00:10:53.176 A:middle
source editor to know exactly

00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:54.626 A:middle
which part of my code still

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:55.336 A:middle
needs covering.

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:57.936 A:middle
So, this is the improved code

00:10:57.936 --> 00:10:58.756 A:middle
coverage in Xcode.
