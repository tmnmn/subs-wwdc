00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:03.116 A:middle
So, here I have a project called

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:03.806 A:middle
Dev Cast.

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:05.986 A:middle
It's a simple messaging app and

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:07.596 A:middle
I created the iOS version for

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:08.566 A:middle
this talk last year.

00:07:08.976 --> 00:07:10.066 A:middle
So, this year, I wanted to

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:11.206 A:middle
create a Mac version.

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:13.396 A:middle
But I wanted to share the

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:14.956 A:middle
business logic between the iOS

00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:16.296 A:middle
and Mac versions, so I put it

00:07:16.296 --> 00:07:17.656 A:middle
all into a framework called

00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:20.886 A:middle
DevCastkit and today, my goal is

00:07:20.886 --> 00:07:22.726 A:middle
to explore and maybe improve the

00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:24.496 A:middle
code coverage of this framework.

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:26.986 A:middle
So, right now, I'm not

00:07:27.056 --> 00:07:28.296 A:middle
collecting code coverage, so I

00:07:28.296 --> 00:07:29.376 A:middle
just need to turn it on.

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:32.146 A:middle
I'll do that by selecting the

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:34.756 A:middle
scheme, selecting edit scheme,

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:38.286 A:middle
go into the test action, go into

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:38.846 A:middle
options.

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:42.216 A:middle
And down here, I will just

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:43.366 A:middle
enable code coverage.

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:49.106 A:middle
Now I will run my test by going

00:07:49.106 --> 00:07:50.496 A:middle
to product test.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:53.446 A:middle
Right now, my framework, my test

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.066 A:middle
bundle and my Mac app are

00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:57.316 A:middle
getting built, and my tests are

00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:57.866 A:middle
being run.

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.196 A:middle
Now the test finished so let's
