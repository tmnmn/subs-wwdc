00:21:59.136 --> 00:22:01.216 A:middle
on disk, you can't expect those

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:02.886 A:middle
file modifications to be visible

00:22:02.886 --> 00:22:04.996 A:middle
to another test class because it

00:22:04.996 --> 00:22:05.846 A:middle
could have access to a

00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
completely separate data

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:07.296 A:middle
container.

00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:10.836 A:middle
In practice, the fact that class

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:12.306 A:middle
is executed on different clones

00:22:12.756 --> 00:22:14.166 A:middle
will likely be invisible to your

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.296 A:middle
tests, but it's something to be

00:22:16.296 --> 00:22:17.406 A:middle
aware of.

00:22:18.416 --> 00:22:20.516 A:middle
So, where can you run tests in

00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:20.966 A:middle
parallel?

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:22.866 A:middle
You can run unit tests in

00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:25.356 A:middle
parallel on macOS, as well as

00:22:25.356 --> 00:22:27.546 A:middle
unit and UI tests in parallel on

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:29.256 A:middle
the iOS and tvOS simulators.

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:31.996 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to give

00:22:31.996 --> 00:22:33.216 A:middle
you a demo of Parallel

00:22:33.216 --> 00:22:34.876 A:middle
Distributed Testing in action.

00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:49.636 A:middle
All right, so this is the Solar

00:22:49.636 --> 00:22:51.446 A:middle
System app, which you may have

00:22:51.446 --> 00:22:52.226 A:middle
seen at some of the other

00:22:52.226 --> 00:22:53.416 A:middle
sessions here at Dub-Dub.

00:22:54.346 --> 00:22:55.526 A:middle
As one of the developers of this

00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:57.296 A:middle
app, I want to run all of my

00:22:57.296 --> 00:22:58.876 A:middle
tests before committing and

00:22:58.876 --> 00:22:59.786 A:middle
pushing my changes to the

00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
repository.
