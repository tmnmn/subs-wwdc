00:13:57.766 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
So, to prevent issues like this,

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.436 A:middle
your tests should always

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.026 A:middle
correctly set up and tear down

00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:04.696 A:middle
their own state.

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:07.546 A:middle
Not only will they be more

00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:09.376 A:middle
reliable, but it will also make

00:14:09.376 --> 00:14:10.876 A:middle
it possible for your tests to

00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:12.246 A:middle
run independently of all the

00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:14.396 A:middle
other ones and this can be

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.386 A:middle
really beneficial during

00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:16.616 A:middle
development and debugging.

00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:19.846 A:middle
So, to help you ensure that

00:14:19.846 --> 00:14:21.146 A:middle
there are no unintentional

00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:22.736 A:middle
dependencies between your tests,

00:14:23.306 --> 00:14:25.056 A:middle
in Xcode 10, we're introducing

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:27.406 A:middle
the new test randomization mode.

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:30.136 A:middle
If you turn it on, your tests

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:31.886 A:middle
will be randomly shuffled before

00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:32.846 A:middle
every time they're run.

00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:35.856 A:middle
And if your tests still pass

00:14:36.016 --> 00:14:37.636 A:middle
with this mode on, you can be

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:38.756 A:middle
more confident that they are

00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:39.726 A:middle
really robust and

00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:40.426 A:middle
self-contained.

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:44.166 A:middle
Randomization mode can be

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.896 A:middle
enabled in the scheme editor,

00:14:45.896 --> 00:14:46.986 A:middle
just like the other features

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:47.766 A:middle
we've seen today.

00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:51.326 A:middle
So, these are the new test

00:14:51.326 --> 00:14:53.126 A:middle
selection and ordering features

00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:55.676 A:middle
in Xcode 10.

00:14:55.886 --> 00:14:57.206 A:middle
Now I'm really excited about

00:14:57.206 --> 00:14:57.936 A:middle
what comes next.

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.686 A:middle
To tell you all about the new
