00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
Now while my tests are

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
executing, I'm going to switch

00:26:02.976 --> 00:26:05.066 A:middle
back to Xcode and show you the

00:26:05.066 --> 00:26:05.786 A:middle
test log.

00:26:06.616 --> 00:26:07.866 A:middle
You can find the test log

00:26:08.456 --> 00:26:10.116 A:middle
associated with the test report.

00:26:11.436 --> 00:26:13.136 A:middle
The log is a great place to see

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:14.756 A:middle
how your classes are being

00:26:14.756 --> 00:26:15.966 A:middle
distributed to the different

00:26:15.966 --> 00:26:16.356 A:middle
runners.

00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:19.886 A:middle
You can see an entry in the log

00:26:20.026 --> 00:26:22.726 A:middle
for each runner and beneath a

00:26:22.726 --> 00:26:24.226 A:middle
given runner, you can see the

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:25.596 A:middle
exact test class that it is

00:26:25.596 --> 00:26:26.526 A:middle
currently executing.

00:26:27.806 --> 00:26:28.916 A:middle
So, when the tests are

00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:30.626 A:middle
completely finished, this is a

00:26:30.626 --> 00:26:32.036 A:middle
great place to see how your

00:26:32.036 --> 00:26:33.676 A:middle
classes were distributed, which

00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:34.626 A:middle
gives you a picture of the

00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:35.866 A:middle
overall parallelization.

00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:38.536 A:middle
And with that, let's switch back

00:26:38.536 --> 00:26:39.146 A:middle
to the slides.

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:47.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:49.956 A:middle
So, let's briefly recap what we

00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:50.726 A:middle
learned in the demo.

00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:53.806 A:middle
First, we saw how to enable

00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:55.616 A:middle
parallelization in the scheme

00:26:55.616 --> 00:26:56.046 A:middle
editor.

00:26:57.466 --> 00:26:59.226 A:middle
Next, we saw how to view results

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
in the test report, as well as
