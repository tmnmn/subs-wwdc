00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.196 A:middle
Now the test finished so let's

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:02.296 A:middle
look at the results.

00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:03.906 A:middle
We'll go to the report navigator

00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:06.486 A:middle
and to the latest coverage

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.016 A:middle
reports.

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:11.566 A:middle
Here, I can see that I have the

00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:14.306 A:middle
-- both targets, the Mac app and

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:15.106 A:middle
also the framework.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:18.606 A:middle
Now the Mac app only serves as a

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:20.826 A:middle
container for running tests, so

00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:22.066 A:middle
I'm not really concerned about

00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:23.316 A:middle
its low code coverage.

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:25.146 A:middle
In fact, I would actually not

00:08:25.146 --> 00:08:26.836 A:middle
want to see it in this report at

00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:27.226 A:middle
all.

00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:30.316 A:middle
So, I can do that by editing the

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:31.006 A:middle
scheme again.

00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:37.056 A:middle
And in the test action, here --

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:38.285 A:middle
instead of gathering coverage

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:40.686 A:middle
for all targets, I'll change to

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.666 A:middle
just some targets.

00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:44.906 A:middle
This gives me a hard cover list

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:47.476 A:middle
and I will add just the target

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:48.836 A:middle
that I'm interested in, which is

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:49.366 A:middle
the framework.

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:56.186 A:middle
Now I will rerun my tests and

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.176 A:middle
look at the updated coverage
