00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
repository.

00:23:01.586 --> 00:23:02.996 A:middle
However, as I add more and more

00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:04.686 A:middle
tests, this is starting to take

00:23:04.686 --> 00:23:05.946 A:middle
longer and longer, and it's

00:23:05.946 --> 00:23:06.956 A:middle
becoming a bottleneck in my

00:23:06.956 --> 00:23:07.516 A:middle
workflow.

00:23:08.486 --> 00:23:09.466 A:middle
So, let's see how parallel

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.156 A:middle
testing can help.

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:12.626 A:middle
I'll go ahead and switch over to

00:23:12.626 --> 00:23:15.166 A:middle
the Xcode project and I already

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.866 A:middle
ran my tests and I want to see

00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:21.416 A:middle
how long they took to run.

00:23:21.596 --> 00:23:23.736 A:middle
All right, let's go back to the

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:24.356 A:middle
test report.

00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:26.526 A:middle
So, here, you can see next to

00:23:26.526 --> 00:23:28.496 A:middle
each method, we show exactly how

00:23:28.496 --> 00:23:29.626 A:middle
long that method took to

00:23:29.626 --> 00:23:30.146 A:middle
execute.

00:23:31.296 --> 00:23:33.376 A:middle
Next, for each test class, we

00:23:33.376 --> 00:23:35.126 A:middle
show the percentage of passing

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:37.236 A:middle
and failing tests, as well as

00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:38.786 A:middle
how long the test class took to

00:23:38.786 --> 00:23:39.266 A:middle
execute.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:41.836 A:middle
And finally, in the top right

00:23:41.836 --> 00:23:43.826 A:middle
corner, you can see exactly how

00:23:43.826 --> 00:23:45.196 A:middle
long all of your tests took to

00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:45.416 A:middle
run.

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.266 A:middle
So, here, we can see that our

00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:48.446 A:middle
tests took 14 seconds.

00:23:49.676 --> 00:23:50.676 A:middle
Now I'd like to enable

00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:52.626 A:middle
parallelization, which I can do

00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.606 A:middle
by going to the scheme.

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:55.826 A:middle
So, I'll select the scheme and

00:23:55.826 --> 00:23:56.846 A:middle
choose edit scheme.

00:23:57.876 --> 00:23:59.516 A:middle
Next, I'll click the test action
