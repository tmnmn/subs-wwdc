00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:00.196 A:middle
want.

00:16:00.296 --> 00:16:01.066 A:middle
That's what you want.

00:16:01.146 --> 00:16:01.996 A:middle
And that's what we want.

00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:04.426 A:middle
We want happy customers having a

00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:05.606 A:middle
wonderful time with products

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:06.436 A:middle
that work reliably.

00:16:06.436 --> 00:16:11.556 A:middle
Now I want to cover API choices.

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:15.156 A:middle
Thirty years ago we had BSD

00:16:15.156 --> 00:16:15.776 A:middle
Sockets.

00:16:16.396 --> 00:16:18.296 A:middle
And it was a great API 30 years

00:16:18.296 --> 00:16:18.616 A:middle
ago.

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:21.616 A:middle
But 30 years ago we didn't have

00:16:22.426 --> 00:16:24.476 A:middle
mobile computers in our pockets.

00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:25.576 A:middle
We didn't have wireless

00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:26.216 A:middle
networking.

00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:29.126 A:middle
We didn't have IPv6.

00:16:29.326 --> 00:16:31.026 A:middle
We didn't have many computers

00:16:31.026 --> 00:16:32.066 A:middle
with more than one network

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:32.746 A:middle
interface.

00:16:32.896 --> 00:16:34.936 A:middle
If you had an Ethernet port on

00:16:34.936 --> 00:16:36.176 A:middle
your computer, that was a fancy

00:16:36.176 --> 00:16:36.716 A:middle
computer.

00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:40.236 A:middle
Now 4 billion people around the

00:16:40.236 --> 00:16:42.806 A:middle
world have a multi-homed IPv6

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:44.566 A:middle
wireless battery-powered

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:46.226 A:middle
computing device that does power

00:16:46.226 --> 00:16:47.456 A:middle
management and goes to sleep to

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.116 A:middle
save energy.

00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:49.716 A:middle
The world has become a lot more

00:16:49.716 --> 00:16:50.376 A:middle
complicated.

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:53.246 A:middle
Many of you may be using

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:55.326 A:middle
third-party libraries which are

00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:56.356 A:middle
built on that Sockets

00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:57.016 A:middle
foundation.

00:16:57.686 --> 00:16:59.996 A:middle
Many more of you may be using

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:00.816 A:middle
URLSession.
