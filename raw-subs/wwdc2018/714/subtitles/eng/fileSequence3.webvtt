00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
performance at the end because

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:02.716 A:middle
it's too late.

00:03:03.456 --> 00:03:05.176 A:middle
Always, always, always run and

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:06.646 A:middle
test your app using Network Link

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:08.266 A:middle
Conditioner and that way if you

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.266 A:middle
make a programming mistake that

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:11.276 A:middle
has horrible performance

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:12.726 A:middle
implications, you see it right

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:13.916 A:middle
away and you can fix it right

00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:14.186 A:middle
away.

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:16.986 A:middle
Use tools like Wireshark and

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:19.036 A:middle
tcptrace to understand the

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:20.336 A:middle
network performance of your app.

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:21.746 A:middle
It's a lot like using

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:23.046 A:middle
Instruments to look at memory

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:24.166 A:middle
and CPU usage.

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.866 A:middle
If you haven't seen tcptrace, it

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:28.186 A:middle
is a wonderful tool that

00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:29.976 A:middle
produces graphs like this that

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.476 A:middle
let you see at a glance what's

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:32.486 A:middle
going on, on the network.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:34.566 A:middle
If you want to learn more about

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:35.866 A:middle
that, check out the video from

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.546 A:middle
three years ago.

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:41.566 A:middle
IPv6 usage continues to grow.

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:43.816 A:middle
Why is that important?

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.006 A:middle
It's important because IPv6 is

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:47.946 A:middle
shown to have better performance

00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:48.846 A:middle
than IPv4.

00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:50.286 A:middle
And if you care about

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:51.796 A:middle
performance, you want to make

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:53.596 A:middle
sure not just your app but the

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:55.236 A:middle
service your app is talking to

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:56.836 A:middle
support Native IPv6.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:03:59.156 A:middle
Some places in the world are

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.546 A:middle
doing better in this respect
