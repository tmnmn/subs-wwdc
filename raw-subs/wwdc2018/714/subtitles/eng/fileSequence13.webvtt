00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:02.116 A:middle
You've probably heard cases

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:05.666 A:middle
where certificate authorities,

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.026 A:middle
either through malice or

00:13:07.026 --> 00:13:08.986 A:middle
incompetence, issue rogue

00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:10.646 A:middle
certificates to entities that

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:11.196 A:middle
they should not.

00:13:12.556 --> 00:13:14.046 A:middle
The solution to this is

00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:15.546 A:middle
something called certificate

00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:16.766 A:middle
transparency logs.

00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:19.426 A:middle
Every legitimate certificate

00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:22.326 A:middle
authority now issues a public

00:13:22.926 --> 00:13:24.766 A:middle
statement of every certificate

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:25.516 A:middle
it issues.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.076 A:middle
And those are recorded in public

00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:29.296 A:middle
logs for anybody to inspect.

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:31.836 A:middle
And this means that if a rogue

00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:34.436 A:middle
certificate authority issues a

00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:36.596 A:middle
bogus certificate, if it

00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:37.786 A:middle
publishes it, they'll

00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:40.656 A:middle
immediately get caught.

00:13:40.656 --> 00:13:41.856 A:middle
And if they don't publish it,

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.486 A:middle
they'll be caught by the client.

00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:46.596 A:middle
This is the setup you're

00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:47.966 A:middle
probably familiar with.

00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:50.356 A:middle
The new entity here is the log.

00:13:51.186 --> 00:13:52.736 A:middle
When a certificate authority

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:54.786 A:middle
issues a certificate to a

00:13:54.786 --> 00:13:57.616 A:middle
server, it also records that

00:13:57.616 --> 00:13:59.896 A:middle
with the log and the log gives

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.776 A:middle
the server a signed affidavit
