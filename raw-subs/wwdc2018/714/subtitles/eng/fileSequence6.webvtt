00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:01.976 A:middle
so it can switch that connection

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:03.846 A:middle
live to a different interface.

00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:08.416 A:middle
We talked last year about how to

00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:09.876 A:middle
enable this in your application.

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:11.706 A:middle
And, of course, check with your

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:13.076 A:middle
server operators to make sure

00:06:13.076 --> 00:06:14.106 A:middle
your servers are supporting

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:14.976 A:middle
Multipath too.

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:18.246 A:middle
We recently did a survey of the

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:20.196 A:middle
mobile carriers that Apple works

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:22.036 A:middle
with around the world and right

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:25.706 A:middle
now 78% of their networks work

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:28.226 A:middle
with Multipath TCP.

00:06:28.696 --> 00:06:30.496 A:middle
Only 22% of carriers are still

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:32.016 A:middle
blocking Multipath connections.

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:37.456 A:middle
TCP Fast Open is a technology

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:39.536 A:middle
that lets you avoid the normal

00:06:39.536 --> 00:06:41.446 A:middle
round-trip delay of the TCP

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:42.426 A:middle
connection set up.

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:46.216 A:middle
TCP Fast Open lets you put your

00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:48.766 A:middle
initial data in with the TCP

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.706 A:middle
connection set up packets.

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:53.856 A:middle
You can check out more details

00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:55.096 A:middle
of that from our video from

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:55.976 A:middle
three years ago.

00:06:56.476 --> 00:06:57.856 A:middle
And check with your server

00:06:57.856 --> 00:06:59.286 A:middle
operators to make sure that your

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:03.256 A:middle
servers support TCP Fast Open.
