00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:00.326 A:middle
You can learn more about that

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.526 A:middle
watching last year's video.

00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:03.956 A:middle
What this means is if you want a

00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:05.566 A:middle
connection, you tell the system

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:06.566 A:middle
I want a connection.

00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:09.006 A:middle
Now if you can, later if not.

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:10.976 A:middle
If the device is in airplane

00:11:10.976 --> 00:11:12.396 A:middle
mode, then when it's out of

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:13.566 A:middle
airplane mode your connection

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:14.216 A:middle
will succeed.

00:11:14.686 --> 00:11:16.266 A:middle
That is much easier than

00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:17.396 A:middle
building the retry loop

00:11:17.396 --> 00:11:17.866 A:middle
yourself.

00:11:18.876 --> 00:11:20.466 A:middle
There is one case we've seen

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:22.456 A:middle
with developers which does make

00:11:22.456 --> 00:11:24.516 A:middle
sense which is if you're going

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:26.046 A:middle
to have the user answer a lot of

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:27.876 A:middle
information in a form, you may

00:11:27.876 --> 00:11:29.146 A:middle
not want to waste the user's

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:31.186 A:middle
time if you have good reason to

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:33.096 A:middle
believe that may later fail.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.736 A:middle
If that is the use case you care

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.366 A:middle
about, stay after the break

00:11:37.606 --> 00:11:39.076 A:middle
because we have a new way to do

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:43.166 A:middle
that that's much better.

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:45.436 A:middle
Security remains important, as

00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:46.286 A:middle
always.

00:11:47.316 --> 00:11:49.696 A:middle
After ten years of using TLS

00:11:49.736 --> 00:11:52.256 A:middle
1.2, the Internet is now ready

00:11:52.256 --> 00:11:53.886 A:middle
to move to its successor, TLS

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:54.646 A:middle
1.3.

00:11:55.286 --> 00:11:56.406 A:middle
It has a number of improved

00:11:56.406 --> 00:11:57.566 A:middle
security features.

00:11:58.146 --> 00:12:00.066 A:middle
It has reduced connection setup
