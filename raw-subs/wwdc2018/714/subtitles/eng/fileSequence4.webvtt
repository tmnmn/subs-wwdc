00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.546 A:middle
doing better in this respect

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:01.086 A:middle
than others.

00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:04.006 A:middle
In the US, we're now up to 87%

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:05.686 A:middle
of mobile carriers offering

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:05.996 A:middle
IPv6.

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.456 A:middle
Other places like India are

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.546 A:middle
doing pretty well too.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:11.416 A:middle
And let's focus a bit more on

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:11.696 A:middle
India.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:14.596 A:middle
Here is some data that the

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:15.766 A:middle
networking team at Apple

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:18.326 A:middle
gathered earlier this year about

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:21.086 A:middle
net TCP connection setup time

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:24.566 A:middle
and ongoing round-trip delay on

00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:26.606 A:middle
cellular networks in India.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.756 A:middle
The blue line is IPv6.

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:31.416 A:middle
And if we, for example, look at

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.946 A:middle
the 75th percentile, we can say

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:39.316 A:middle
75% of TCP connections over v6

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:40.986 A:middle
are set up in less than 150

00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:41.746 A:middle
milliseconds.

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:44.576 A:middle
The comparable number for IPv4

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.796 A:middle
is worse than 325.

00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:48.636 A:middle
It's more than twice as slow.

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:50.976 A:middle
So if you want fast, responsive

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:53.526 A:middle
applications for your users, get

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.166 A:middle
on IPv6 if you're not already.

00:04:56.926 --> 00:04:58.516 A:middle
Another technology that improves

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.526 A:middle
performance by reducing packet
