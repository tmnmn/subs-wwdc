00:09:59.246 --> 00:10:02.296 A:middle
that many developers use

00:10:02.446 --> 00:10:04.426 A:middle
SCNetworkReachability as a

00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:05.326 A:middle
preflight check.

00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:07.686 A:middle
They want to predict the future.

00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:09.076 A:middle
They want to know whether the

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:10.936 A:middle
next network operation they do

00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:12.096 A:middle
will succeed or fail.

00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:14.956 A:middle
And, unfortunately, predicting

00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:16.116 A:middle
the future is always a hard

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:16.666 A:middle
thing to do.

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.786 A:middle
You may have connectivity now

00:10:19.476 --> 00:10:20.966 A:middle
but two seconds from now the

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:22.366 A:middle
user has walked out of the

00:10:22.366 --> 00:10:23.696 A:middle
building and you've lost the

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:24.496 A:middle
Wi-Fi signal.

00:10:24.886 --> 00:10:27.656 A:middle
So there is no way to guarantee

00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:29.026 A:middle
whether a future operation will

00:10:29.026 --> 00:10:29.566 A:middle
succeed.

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:32.356 A:middle
And we see this pattern where

00:10:32.356 --> 00:10:32.826 A:middle
they check.

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.326 A:middle
The preflight says yes.

00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:35.006 A:middle
They try it.

00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:35.686 A:middle
They fail.

00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:36.836 A:middle
They go back.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:37.716 A:middle
They check again.

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:41.016 A:middle
This also is a lot of work, a

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.546 A:middle
lot of [inaudible], a lot of

00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:44.026 A:middle
difficult things to get right

00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:46.426 A:middle
including networks with proxies.

00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:48.776 A:middle
We can handle that for you.

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:53.746 A:middle
The better way to do this is

00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:56.006 A:middle
just make a connection using the

00:10:56.006 --> 00:10:58.616 A:middle
waitsForConnectivity option.

00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:00.326 A:middle
You can learn more about that
