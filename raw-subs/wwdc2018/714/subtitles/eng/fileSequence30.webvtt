00:29:59.706 --> 00:30:02.046 A:middle
The algorithms that URLSession

00:30:02.246 --> 00:30:05.196 A:middle
supports and recommends are Gzip

00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:05.796 A:middle
and Brotli.

00:30:07.226 --> 00:30:09.756 A:middle
Gzip is widely supported and is

00:30:09.756 --> 00:30:10.706 A:middle
relatively fast.

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:13.616 A:middle
Brotli support was introduced

00:30:13.616 --> 00:30:16.686 A:middle
last year in iOS 11 and macOS

00:30:16.686 --> 00:30:17.356 A:middle
High Sierra.

00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:20.076 A:middle
Brotli is optimized for

00:30:20.076 --> 00:30:22.136 A:middle
structured text and HTML.

00:30:22.136 --> 00:30:24.356 A:middle
And it has the best compression

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:26.726 A:middle
ratio on short data.

00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:29.196 A:middle
Please enable compression on

00:30:29.196 --> 00:30:30.726 A:middle
your servers if you haven't done

00:30:30.726 --> 00:30:31.476 A:middle
so already.

00:30:32.016 --> 00:30:34.986 A:middle
Let's move on to our next topic

00:30:34.986 --> 00:30:37.096 A:middle
for the day: increasing

00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:37.926 A:middle
responsiveness.

00:30:39.146 --> 00:30:40.566 A:middle
Coming back to our restaurant

00:30:40.566 --> 00:30:40.926 A:middle
example.

00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.906 A:middle
Here you are here in San Jose

00:30:42.906 --> 00:30:44.656 A:middle
for WWDC, and you decide to meet

00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:45.986 A:middle
up with some old friends.

00:30:46.116 --> 00:30:48.086 A:middle
You and your friends are sitting

00:30:48.086 --> 00:30:49.056 A:middle
at the restaurant table.

00:30:49.636 --> 00:30:51.456 A:middle
Your drinks are here, but you

00:30:51.456 --> 00:30:52.746 A:middle
would like some more time to

00:30:52.746 --> 00:30:53.866 A:middle
catch up with your friends

00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:55.216 A:middle
before the food comes out.

00:30:56.216 --> 00:30:57.346 A:middle
You can simply tell the waiter,

00:30:58.076 --> 00:30:58.956 A:middle
"Can you please bring out our

00:30:58.956 --> 00:30:59.926 A:middle
food after some time?

00:30:59.926 --> 00:31:01.216 A:middle
We are in no rush."
