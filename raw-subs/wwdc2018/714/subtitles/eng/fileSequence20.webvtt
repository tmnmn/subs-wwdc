00:19:56.766 --> 00:20:00.746 A:middle
support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1.

00:20:02.056 --> 00:20:04.136 A:middle
If your app does not use HTTP,

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:05.966 A:middle
we have support for

00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:09.226 A:middle
URLSessionStreamTask, an API

00:20:09.226 --> 00:20:11.056 A:middle
that allows you to make secure

00:20:11.056 --> 00:20:12.946 A:middle
TCP connections to a server over

00:20:13.256 --> 00:20:14.786 A:middle
which you can build your

00:20:14.786 --> 00:20:15.796 A:middle
arbitrary protocol.

00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:18.656 A:middle
That's URLSession.

00:20:19.716 --> 00:20:20.866 A:middle
Let's move on to our first

00:20:20.866 --> 00:20:23.926 A:middle
agenda item: reducing latency.

00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:26.246 A:middle
Let's suppose you and your

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:28.096 A:middle
friends go to a restaurant where

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.706 A:middle
the waiter walks up to you and

00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.296 A:middle
you say, "Can I get a glass of

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:31.866 A:middle
water please?"

00:20:32.746 --> 00:20:34.576 A:middle
The waiter say, "Sure," walks

00:20:34.576 --> 00:20:35.896 A:middle
away, fetches you a glass of

00:20:35.896 --> 00:20:36.196 A:middle
water.

00:20:37.016 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
Your friend then says, "Can I

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:39.406 A:middle
get a glass of water too?"

00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:41.386 A:middle
The waiter says, "Sure," walks

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:42.886 A:middle
away, and fetches your friend a

00:20:42.886 --> 00:20:43.876 A:middle
glass of water.

00:20:44.526 --> 00:20:45.576 A:middle
Wouldn't it be faster if the

00:20:45.576 --> 00:20:46.836 A:middle
waiter took everyone's order at

00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:48.556 A:middle
the same time and reduce the

00:20:48.556 --> 00:20:49.486 A:middle
number of round trips?

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.286 A:middle
The idea to reduce latency is

00:20:52.286 --> 00:20:52.746 A:middle
simple.

00:20:53.536 --> 00:20:54.966 A:middle
To reduce the number of back and

00:20:54.966 --> 00:20:56.116 A:middle
forths when you fetch a

00:20:56.116 --> 00:20:56.696 A:middle
resource.

00:20:57.626 --> 00:20:59.896 A:middle
Let's see how your apps can do
