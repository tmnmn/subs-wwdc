00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:03.256 A:middle
servers support TCP Fast Open.

00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:05.586 A:middle
Now moving on to some new news.

00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:09.176 A:middle
There is a technology that many

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:10.776 A:middle
of you will have heard of called

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:11.106 A:middle
Quick.

00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:13.326 A:middle
Quick is a new transport

00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:15.856 A:middle
protocol, the first serious

00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:17.516 A:middle
candidate in 30 years for a

00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:19.246 A:middle
successor to replace TCP.

00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:21.576 A:middle
It started off as an experiment

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:23.086 A:middle
by some engineers at Google.

00:07:23.566 --> 00:07:24.716 A:middle
That experiment proved

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:25.366 A:middle
successful.

00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:27.626 A:middle
It has now been adopted as an

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:29.876 A:middle
IETF work in group item for

00:07:29.876 --> 00:07:30.766 A:middle
standardization.

00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:33.256 A:middle
Apple engineers are

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:34.446 A:middle
participating in that.

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:35.816 A:middle
In fact, we have engineers right

00:07:35.816 --> 00:07:37.786 A:middle
now at the Quick meeting taking

00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:38.596 A:middle
place in Sweden.

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:41.916 A:middle
This is not yet ready for prime

00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:42.286 A:middle
time.

00:07:42.286 --> 00:07:43.506 A:middle
The standard is not finished,

00:07:44.016 --> 00:07:45.416 A:middle
but Apple is working on it.

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:47.146 A:middle
As soon as it is ready, you can

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:48.306 A:middle
expect to see Apple API

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:50.916 A:middle
supporting that.

00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:52.256 A:middle
Continuing in the theme of

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:55.406 A:middle
performance, we observed some

00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:56.656 A:middle
behavior that's very common.

00:07:57.356 --> 00:07:59.336 A:middle
Lots and lots of websites and

00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:01.036 A:middle
Internet services use pretty
