00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.256 A:middle
have never owned a desktop

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:03.646 A:middle
computer who may never own a

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
desktop computer.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:06.926 A:middle
Their primary computing and

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.675 A:middle
communication device is their

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:09.356 A:middle
Smartphone.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.356 A:middle
And a lot of those Smartphones

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:14.166 A:middle
are still using 2G networks.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.486 A:middle
I'm sure most of us in this room

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:20.166 A:middle
are fortunate enough to live in

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.916 A:middle
places and work in places where

00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:23.406 A:middle
we build our apps where we have

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:24.946 A:middle
fast LTE networks.

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:27.266 A:middle
And that can be a handicap

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:31.076 A:middle
because if you build your app so

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:33.896 A:middle
it works well in LTE, it may

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:35.996 A:middle
perform very, very badly on 2G.

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:37.956 A:middle
One of your competitors,

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:39.106 A:middle
somewhere else in the world, who

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.476 A:middle
builds an app that works great

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:42.716 A:middle
on 2G is going to be fantastic

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:43.366 A:middle
on LTE.

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:46.436 A:middle
So we have a tool to help

00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:48.946 A:middle
everybody mimic some of the

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.766 A:middle
properties of these slower

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:52.476 A:middle
networks and that's Network Link

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:53.056 A:middle
Conditioner.

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:55.266 A:middle
You should build your app

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.026 A:middle
running Network Link Conditioner

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:57.946 A:middle
right from the start.

00:02:58.206 --> 00:02:59.476 A:middle
Don't think you can add in

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:02.046 A:middle
performance at the end because
