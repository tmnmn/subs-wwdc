They are not free and have a

00:29:01.646 --> 00:29:03.216 A:middle
non-trivial cost in storing and

00:29:03.216 --> 00:29:03.846 A:middle
looking them up.

00:29:05.256 --> 00:29:06.836 A:middle
Cookies are attached to all the

00:29:06.836 --> 00:29:08.676 A:middle
requests that match the domain

00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:09.946 A:middle
and path attribute.

00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:11.856 A:middle
And it can quickly increase your

00:29:11.856 --> 00:29:12.636 A:middle
request size.

00:29:13.996 --> 00:29:15.946 A:middle
Please use the domain and path

00:29:15.946 --> 00:29:17.966 A:middle
attribute wisely to make sure

00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:19.826 A:middle
cookies required by the servers

00:29:19.896 --> 00:29:21.306 A:middle
are attached to your requests.

Use of smaller cookies when

00:29:23.756 --> 00:29:25.336 A:middle
possible, and delete these

00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:26.606 A:middle
cookies when you no longer need

00:29:26.606 --> 00:29:26.846 A:middle
them.

00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:29.896 A:middle
Try to save some state on the

00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:31.686 A:middle
server so you can reduce the

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.246 A:middle
number of client-side cookies.

00:29:33.716 --> 00:29:36.856 A:middle
Also consider moving to HTTP/2

00:29:37.326 --> 00:29:38.766 A:middle
to get benefits of header

00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:39.356 A:middle
compression.

00:29:39.906 --> 00:29:42.476 A:middle
Let's talk a little more about

00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:43.176 A:middle
compression.

00:29:43.706 --> 00:29:48.646 A:middle
HTTP compression, also known as

00:29:48.646 --> 00:29:51.126 A:middle
content and coding, is simply

00:29:51.176 --> 00:29:53.026 A:middle
compressing the data that is

00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:54.616 A:middle
shuttled between the client and

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.096 A:middle
the server.

00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:57.666 A:middle
This allows us to better utilize

00:29:57.696 --> 00:29:58.276 A:middle
the bandwidth.
