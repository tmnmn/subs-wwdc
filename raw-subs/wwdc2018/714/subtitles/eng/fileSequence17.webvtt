00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:00.816 A:middle
URLSession.

00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:03.006 A:middle
And you may have assumed that

00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:05.626 A:middle
URLSession is also just a wrap

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:06.556 A:middle
around Sockets.

00:17:07.906 --> 00:17:09.526 A:middle
Well, not quite.

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:13.046 A:middle
URLSession is actually built

00:17:13.326 --> 00:17:15.445 A:middle
using Apple's user space

00:17:15.656 --> 00:17:17.386 A:middle
networking code network

00:17:17.386 --> 00:17:17.856 A:middle
framework.

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:21.306 A:middle
And starting now, in iOS 12, we

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.976 A:middle
are exposing that same API that

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.056 A:middle
URLSession uses so that your

00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:29.316 A:middle
apps can directly use that for

00:17:29.486 --> 00:17:31.986 A:middle
making TCP connections and other

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:33.266 A:middle
appropriate use cases.

00:17:33.526 --> 00:17:35.266 A:middle
If you're doing things with URLs

00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:37.356 A:middle
and HTTP GETs, URLSession is

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.716 A:middle
still your API of choice.

00:17:39.056 --> 00:17:41.116 A:middle
But for the things URLSession

00:17:41.116 --> 00:17:43.316 A:middle
doesn't cover, we now expose

00:17:43.316 --> 00:17:45.766 A:middle
network framework so your apps

00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:46.896 A:middle
can use that directly.

00:17:47.876 --> 00:17:49.816 A:middle
And if you're the developer of

00:17:49.816 --> 00:17:50.896 A:middle
one of these third-party

00:17:50.896 --> 00:17:51.866 A:middle
libraries, which are very

00:17:51.866 --> 00:17:54.156 A:middle
popular that are built on BSD

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.606 A:middle
Sockets, we encourage you to

00:17:56.606 --> 00:17:58.716 A:middle
look at the network framework

00:17:58.716 --> 00:17:59.216 A:middle
APIs.

00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:02.016 A:middle
Move your library over to these
