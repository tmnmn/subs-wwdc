00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.776 A:middle
the server a signed affidavit

00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:03.656 A:middle
that its certificate has been

00:14:03.656 --> 00:14:04.646 A:middle
publicly recorded.

00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:06.076 A:middle
And then when the client

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:08.066 A:middle
connects, the server can give

00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:09.096 A:middle
all that information to the

00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:11.046 A:middle
client and the client can verify

00:14:11.046 --> 00:14:12.256 A:middle
that not only is this a signed

00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:14.236 A:middle
certificate, it is a publicly

00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:15.786 A:middle
logged signed certificate.

00:14:16.916 --> 00:14:18.156 A:middle
Now suppose we have a rogue

00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:20.226 A:middle
certificate authority that

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:22.286 A:middle
doesn't publicly expose the

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:23.836 A:middle
rogue certificates it's issuing.

00:14:24.726 --> 00:14:26.426 A:middle
The client will reject that

00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:27.916 A:middle
because it doesn't have the

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:30.386 A:middle
affidavit to attest to it being

00:14:30.476 --> 00:14:31.826 A:middle
recorded in a public log.

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:34.286 A:middle
Starting later this year, we

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:35.896 A:middle
will be enforcing this.

00:14:37.456 --> 00:14:39.806 A:middle
All newly issued TLS

00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:41.726 A:middle
certificates must include the

00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:43.236 A:middle
verification that they are

00:14:43.236 --> 00:14:44.096 A:middle
publicly logged.

00:14:44.486 --> 00:14:46.036 A:middle
And if they're not, then the

00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:47.056 A:middle
client will reject it.

00:14:47.536 --> 00:14:49.686 A:middle
Your apps don't need to make any

00:14:49.686 --> 00:14:51.926 A:middle
changes, but if you have

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:53.006 A:middle
tailored certificates for your

00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:54.996 A:middle
servers, make sure that your

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:56.686 A:middle
certificate authority is

00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:58.186 A:middle
recording them in the public

00:14:58.306 --> 00:14:59.906 A:middle
certificate transparency logs.
