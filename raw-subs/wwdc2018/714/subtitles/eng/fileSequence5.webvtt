00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.526 A:middle
performance by reducing packet

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:02.286 A:middle
loss and retransmission is

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:03.266 A:middle
Explicit Congestion

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:04.026 A:middle
Notification.

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:06.056 A:middle
We've had this enabled by

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.026 A:middle
default in macOS and iOS for

00:05:08.026 --> 00:05:09.496 A:middle
some years now so you don't need

00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:10.306 A:middle
to do anything on your

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:12.376 A:middle
application to take advantage of

00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:12.726 A:middle
this.

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:14.936 A:middle
Do make sure your service

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.506 A:middle
supports ECN.

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:20.026 A:middle
In a survey we did of the Alexa

00:05:20.026 --> 00:05:22.076 A:middle
top million websites, we found

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:24.276 A:middle
last month we're now up to 77%

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:25.316 A:middle
of the Alexa top million

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:27.226 A:middle
services supporting ECN, which

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.666 A:middle
is a big improvement compared to

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:32.206 A:middle
a few years ago.

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:34.936 A:middle
Another technology that helps

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.506 A:middle
improve performance and

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:37.766 A:middle
resilience of your connections

00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:39.016 A:middle
is Multipath TCP.

00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:41.336 A:middle
Quite often, the user may make a

00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:43.426 A:middle
connection in their office on

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.676 A:middle
Wi-Fi and then they walk outside

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.896 A:middle
and they lose the Wi-Fi signal.

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.516 A:middle
Now with traditional TCP, the

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.666 A:middle
connection is broken.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:51.506 A:middle
You have to reconnect.

00:05:51.506 --> 00:05:52.516 A:middle
You have to start again.

00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:55.356 A:middle
Multipath TCP makes its packet

00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:56.716 A:middle
routing decisions on a per

00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:58.636 A:middle
packet basis not per connection,

00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:01.976 A:middle
so it can switch that connection
