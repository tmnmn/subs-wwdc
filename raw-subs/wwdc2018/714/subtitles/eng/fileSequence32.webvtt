00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:04.016 A:middle
app might be doing.

00:32:04.186 --> 00:32:06.086 A:middle
Network service type is the

00:32:06.086 --> 00:32:08.156 A:middle
property on the URLSession

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:10.946 A:middle
configuration object that allows

00:32:10.946 --> 00:32:12.916 A:middle
you to classify your network

00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:15.596 A:middle
traffic that helps the system

00:32:15.596 --> 00:32:17.376 A:middle
prioritize the data leaving the

00:32:17.376 --> 00:32:17.926 A:middle
device.

00:32:19.276 --> 00:32:21.236 A:middle
This year, we have a new network

00:32:21.236 --> 00:32:22.276 A:middle
service type, the

00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:23.346 A:middle
responsiveData.

00:32:24.656 --> 00:32:26.676 A:middle
ResponsiveData is slightly

00:32:26.676 --> 00:32:28.596 A:middle
higher than the default type but

00:32:28.596 --> 00:32:30.416 A:middle
should be used judiciously.

00:32:31.446 --> 00:32:32.906 A:middle
An example where you might want

00:32:32.906 --> 00:32:35.606 A:middle
to use responsiveData is if you

00:32:35.606 --> 00:32:37.856 A:middle
have a shopping app and you are

00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:38.786 A:middle
on the checkout page.

00:32:39.586 --> 00:32:40.816 A:middle
You might want to mark your

00:32:40.886 --> 00:32:42.346 A:middle
payment request with the

00:32:42.346 --> 00:32:44.376 A:middle
responsiveData to make sure you

00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:45.986 A:middle
get a good response from the

00:32:46.496 --> 00:32:46.636 A:middle
server.

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:49.766 A:middle
Traffic marked with the network

00:32:49.766 --> 00:32:51.676 A:middle
service type property will

00:32:51.676 --> 00:32:53.986 A:middle
maintain this tag across all the

00:32:53.986 --> 00:32:56.386 A:middle
hops when on a Cisco Fast Lane

00:32:56.386 --> 00:32:56.886 A:middle
network.

00:32:58.026 --> 00:32:59.516 A:middle
