00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.116 A:middle
We're also going to cover some

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.296 A:middle
tips and tricks and guidance

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:07.656 A:middle
about how to make the best use

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:10.176 A:middle
of Apple's APIs, a little bit of

00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:12.346 A:middle
news about new technologies on

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:14.716 A:middle
the horizon, and then my

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:16.556 A:middle
colleague Jiten will go into

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:18.106 A:middle
detail on URLSession.

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.956 A:middle
Let's start off with a state of

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:24.796 A:middle
the Internet update.

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.666 A:middle
Earlier this year, we hit a

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.476 A:middle
total of 4 billion people using

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:30.966 A:middle
the Internet.

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:32.466 A:middle
That's more than half of the

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:33.626 A:middle
world's population.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.876 A:middle
And we're used to Internet usage

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:36.846 A:middle
doubling and doubling.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.286 A:middle
Clearly when we passed halfway,

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:40.606 A:middle
the number of people on the

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:42.766 A:middle
Internet can't keep doubling, so

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:45.316 A:middle
that growth is slowing down but

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:46.306 A:middle
that doesn't mean Internet

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:47.576 A:middle
growth is slowing down.

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:49.626 A:middle
There's a lot of growth in

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:50.426 A:middle
machine-to-machine

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:51.996 A:middle
communications, Internet of

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:53.536 A:middle
Things, Smart Homes.

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:55.546 A:middle
There's still a lot of growth in

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:57.046 A:middle
places like India and China.

00:01:58.276 --> 00:01:59.826 A:middle
And there is a lot of people who

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.256 A:middle
have never owned a desktop
