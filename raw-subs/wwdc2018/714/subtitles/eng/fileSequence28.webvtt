00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:01.306 A:middle
It's also important to note that

00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:02.726 A:middle
the URLSession objects are

00:28:02.726 --> 00:28:04.846 A:middle
fairly expensive to create and

00:28:04.846 --> 00:28:06.206 A:middle
have a non-trivial memory

00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:06.676 A:middle
footprint.

00:28:08.036 --> 00:28:09.776 A:middle
As we have in the past, we

00:28:09.816 --> 00:28:11.726 A:middle
continue to advise you to use

00:28:11.726 --> 00:28:13.466 A:middle
fewer URLSession objects.

00:28:13.986 --> 00:28:17.496 A:middle
Let's move on to our next topic

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:19.416 A:middle
for the day: maximizing

00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:19.796 A:middle
throughput.

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:22.596 A:middle
Coming back to our restaurant

00:28:22.596 --> 00:28:23.156 A:middle
example.

00:28:23.986 --> 00:28:25.956 A:middle
The waiter checks up on you and

00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:27.766 A:middle
you say, "Can I get an order of

00:28:28.196 --> 00:28:30.206 A:middle
grilled chicken tossed in creamy

00:28:30.206 --> 00:28:32.006 A:middle
tomato onion gravy made with a

00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:32.646 A:middle
lot of butter?"

00:28:33.906 --> 00:28:34.846 A:middle
Now that's a mouthful.

00:28:35.656 --> 00:28:36.596 A:middle
Wouldn't it be easier if you

00:28:36.596 --> 00:28:38.016 A:middle
just said, "Can I get butter

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:38.356 A:middle
chicken?"

00:28:39.936 --> 00:28:41.556 A:middle
The idea to maximize throughput

00:28:41.556 --> 00:28:43.216 A:middle
is the same where you reduce the

00:28:43.216 --> 00:28:44.296 A:middle
number of bytes that you

00:28:44.296 --> 00:28:45.766 A:middle
transmit when you want to fetch

00:28:45.816 --> 00:28:46.536 A:middle
a resource.

00:28:47.306 --> 00:28:48.686 A:middle
Let's see how your apps can do

00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:49.036 A:middle
this.

00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:52.796 A:middle
Let's look at a couple of ways

00:28:52.796 --> 00:28:55.086 A:middle
to reduce the request size.

00:28:55.956 --> 00:28:58.246 A:middle
Pay attention to HTTP cookies.

00:28:59.076 --> 00:29:01.646 A:middle
They are not free and have a
