00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:02.016 A:middle
Move your library over to these

00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:04.326 A:middle
improved high-performance APIs,

00:18:04.926 --> 00:18:07.036 A:middle
and give us feedback about how

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:07.886 A:middle
that goes for you.

00:18:08.866 --> 00:18:11.086 A:middle
So to summarize, we really

00:18:11.086 --> 00:18:13.786 A:middle
strongly recommend here and now

00:18:14.076 --> 00:18:17.646 A:middle
in 2018 that you avoid using BSD

00:18:17.646 --> 00:18:18.296 A:middle
Sockets.

00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:20.756 A:middle
Avoid using libraries that are

00:18:20.756 --> 00:18:22.706 A:middle
nothing but wrappers around BSD

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:23.316 A:middle
Sockets.

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:25.146 A:middle
And if you are one of the

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.146 A:middle
authors of those libraries using

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:29.456 A:middle
these older APIs, look at

00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:30.116 A:middle
switching over.

00:18:30.116 --> 00:18:32.056 A:middle
Come and meet us in the labs

00:18:32.106 --> 00:18:34.106 A:middle
this afternoon and tomorrow and

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:36.246 A:middle
give us your feedback about what

00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:37.816 A:middle
it takes to move your libraries

00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:39.076 A:middle
to new APIs.

00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:41.316 A:middle
And with that, I would like to

00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:43.106 A:middle
invite my colleagues Jiten to

00:18:43.106 --> 00:18:44.996 A:middle
come up on stage and give you

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.816 A:middle
more details about URLSession.

00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:51.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:53.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Stuart.

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:55.176 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

00:18:55.726 --> 00:18:57.416 A:middle
My name is Jiten Mehta.

00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:58.706 A:middle
And I'm an engineer on the CF

00:18:58.706 --> 00:18:59.316 A:middle
network team.
