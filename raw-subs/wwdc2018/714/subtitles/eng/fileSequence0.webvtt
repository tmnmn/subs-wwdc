[ Applause ]

00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:27.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, ladies and

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:28.196 A:middle
gentlemen.

00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:29.986 A:middle
How many of you are here for the

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
first time at WWDC?

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.806 A:middle
That's fantastic.

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:36.536 A:middle
It's great to see so many new

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.336 A:middle
faces every year.

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.146 A:middle
My name is Stuart Cheshire.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.326 A:middle
And we're going to be talking

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:41.166 A:middle
about networking.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.106 A:middle
I'm going to start by covering

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.946 A:middle
some topics that affect the

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.296 A:middle
performance of your app.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:48.806 A:middle
There's hardly an app that

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:50.776 A:middle
exists today that doesn't make

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:51.766 A:middle
use of networking.

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.026 A:middle
And getting the best performance

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:55.176 A:middle
out of the network is really

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:55.856 A:middle
important.

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:57.236 A:middle
We're going to cover some

00:00:57.236 --> 00:00:58.806 A:middle
technologies here that help you

00:00:58.806 --> 00:00:59.896 A:middle
get the best performance.
