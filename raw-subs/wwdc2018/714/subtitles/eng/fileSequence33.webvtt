00:32:59.516 --> 00:33:02.226 A:middle
API, please view the WWDC

00:33:02.226 --> 00:33:08.086 A:middle
session from the year 2016.

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.736 A:middle
Last year, we introduced the

00:33:09.736 --> 00:33:11.556 A:middle
URLSession Adaptable

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:12.896 A:middle
Connectivity API

00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:14.596 A:middle
waitsForConnectivity.

00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
waitsForConnectivity will simply

00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:20.736 A:middle
wait instead of failing the load

00:33:21.176 --> 00:33:22.616 A:middle
when your task does not have

00:33:22.666 --> 00:33:23.246 A:middle
connectivity.

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:26.006 A:middle
In the past, you've been using

00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:28.016 A:middle
STNeworkReachability to do a

00:33:28.016 --> 00:33:29.726 A:middle
preflight check before you send

00:33:29.726 --> 00:33:30.426 A:middle
out your request.

00:33:31.126 --> 00:33:32.486 A:middle
But as Stuart pointed out a few

00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:34.296 A:middle
slides ago, there is a race

00:33:34.296 --> 00:33:36.026 A:middle
condition where the system might

00:33:36.026 --> 00:33:37.046 A:middle
tell you that you have

00:33:37.046 --> 00:33:39.186 A:middle
connectivity to a server but by

00:33:39.186 --> 00:33:40.406 A:middle
the time you create and send

00:33:40.406 --> 00:33:41.946 A:middle
your request, you've lost your

00:33:41.946 --> 00:33:43.336 A:middle
chance and you're no longer

00:33:43.336 --> 00:33:45.826 A:middle
connected to the server.

00:33:45.826 --> 00:33:46.776 A:middle
We recommend using

00:33:46.776 --> 00:33:48.406 A:middle
waitsForConnectivity which will

00:33:48.406 --> 00:33:50.316 A:middle
simply send out your request as

00:33:50.316 --> 00:33:51.436 A:middle
soon as a connection to the

00:33:51.436 --> 00:33:52.496 A:middle
server is available.

00:33:53.946 --> 00:33:55.816 A:middle
Optionally, you can implement

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:58.066 A:middle
the taskIsWaitigForConnectivity

00:33:58.066 --> 00:33:59.786 A:middle
delegate method which gets

00:33:59.786 --> 00:34:01.116 A:middle
called when your task does not
