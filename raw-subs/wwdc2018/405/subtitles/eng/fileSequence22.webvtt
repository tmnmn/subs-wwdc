00:22:00.106 --> 00:22:02.366 A:middle
Now there are two ways that we

00:22:02.366 --> 00:22:03.656 A:middle
can finish a download.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.766 A:middle
That was the success path.

00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:07.576 A:middle
And then we have to consider the

00:22:07.576 --> 00:22:08.206 A:middle
cancel path.

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:11.176 A:middle
So in prepare for reuse, if we

00:22:11.176 --> 00:22:12.136 A:middle
currently have a running

00:22:12.136 --> 00:22:13.656 A:middle
downloader, we're going to need

00:22:13.716 --> 00:22:15.486 A:middle
to first cancel that downloader.

00:22:16.316 --> 00:22:17.406 A:middle
So in that case, we're going to

00:22:17.406 --> 00:22:18.916 A:middle
emit an end for the interval,

00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:20.936 A:middle
and we're going to use that same

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.376 A:middle
logging handle, signpost name,

00:22:23.956 --> 00:22:24.766 A:middle
signpost ID.

00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:27.046 A:middle
And we're going to use cancelled

00:22:27.046 --> 00:22:29.456 A:middle
as the end metadata to separate

00:22:29.456 --> 00:22:30.496 A:middle
it from when we finish

00:22:30.496 --> 00:22:31.066 A:middle
successfully.

00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:33.606 A:middle
Now that's enough to actually do

00:22:33.606 --> 00:22:34.356 A:middle
some profiling.

00:22:34.356 --> 00:22:35.936 A:middle
So we're going to go over here

00:22:35.996 --> 00:22:38.146 A:middle
to a product profile.

00:22:38.146 --> 00:22:40.086 A:middle
And that will start up

00:22:40.086 --> 00:22:43.876 A:middle
Instruments once we've finished

00:22:43.916 --> 00:22:44.816 A:middle
building and installing.

00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:46.956 A:middle
That will start up Instruments

00:22:46.956 --> 00:22:47.146 A:middle
here.

00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:49.666 A:middle
And we can create a new blank

00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:50.156 A:middle
document.

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:52.456 A:middle
Then we can go to the library,

00:22:52.546 --> 00:22:54.156 A:middle
and I can show you how to use

00:22:54.156 --> 00:22:56.126 A:middle
that new os signpost instrument.

00:22:56.646 --> 00:22:58.556 A:middle
So we have our new os signpost

00:22:58.556 --> 00:22:59.256 A:middle
instrument here.

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:02.046 A:middle
And we'll just drag and drop
