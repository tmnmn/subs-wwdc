00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:00.726 A:middle
it's passed in the image name

00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:01.856 A:middle
that should be downloaded.

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:03.666 A:middle
Now we have a download helper

00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:05.896 A:middle
class here that we create an

00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:07.386 A:middle
instance of an pass in the name

00:20:07.386 --> 00:20:08.546 A:middle
and set ourself as the delegate

00:20:08.546 --> 00:20:09.626 A:middle
so it'll call us back when it's

00:20:09.656 --> 00:20:10.136 A:middle
downloaded.

00:20:10.136 --> 00:20:13.486 A:middle
And in this case, since the

00:20:13.486 --> 00:20:15.386 A:middle
downloader represents the

00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:16.816 A:middle
concurrent activity that's going

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:19.016 A:middle
on, this asynchronous work, it's

00:20:19.016 --> 00:20:20.836 A:middle
a great basis for a signpost ID.

00:20:21.046 --> 00:20:22.046 A:middle
So we're going to create our

00:20:22.046 --> 00:20:24.656 A:middle
signpost ID using our downloader

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:25.156 A:middle
object.

00:20:26.606 --> 00:20:27.746 A:middle
Now to start our signposts,

00:20:27.746 --> 00:20:28.926 A:middle
we're going to do an os signpost

00:20:28.926 --> 00:20:29.356 A:middle
begin.

00:20:29.656 --> 00:20:30.886 A:middle
And we're going to send it to

00:20:30.886 --> 00:20:32.836 A:middle
our networking log handle so

00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:34.606 A:middle
take a real quick look at our

00:20:34.606 --> 00:20:35.616 A:middle
networking log handle.

00:20:35.926 --> 00:20:37.516 A:middle
You see we're using our

00:20:37.516 --> 00:20:39.446 A:middle
Trailblazer bundle ID and a

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:40.906 A:middle
category of networking.

00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:45.786 A:middle
Now we're going to pass an image

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.896 A:middle
or, sorry, a signpost name of

00:20:47.896 --> 00:20:49.086 A:middle
background image so that way we

00:20:49.086 --> 00:20:50.216 A:middle
can see all of our background

00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:51.106 A:middle
image downloads.

00:20:51.106 --> 00:20:52.936 A:middle
And it will pass that signpost

00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:53.756 A:middle
ID that we created.

00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:56.356 A:middle
And we'll attach some metadata

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:59.206 A:middle
to begin to convey the name of

00:20:59.206 --> 00:21:00.456 A:middle
the image that we are
