00:20:59.206 --> 00:21:00.456 A:middle
the image that we are

00:21:00.606 --> 00:21:01.016 A:middle
downloading.

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:02.476 A:middle
So then we'll start our

00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:04.556 A:middle
download, and we'll set our

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:06.526 A:middle
property to track that.

00:21:06.526 --> 00:21:07.226 A:middle
We have it currently

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.096 A:middle
runningDownloader.

00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:10.406 A:middle
Now when that finishes, we'll

00:21:10.406 --> 00:21:11.906 A:middle
get this didReceiveImage

00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:12.736 A:middle
callback here.

00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:15.266 A:middle
And we'll set our image view to

00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:16.266 A:middle
the image that we received.

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:19.086 A:middle
And we'll call end on the

00:21:19.086 --> 00:21:19.686 A:middle
signpost.

00:21:19.926 --> 00:21:21.316 A:middle
And we'll use the exact same log

00:21:21.316 --> 00:21:23.266 A:middle
handle, the same name, the same

00:21:23.266 --> 00:21:25.666 A:middle
signpost ID but this time we're

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:27.686 A:middle
going to attach some end

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.286 A:middle
metadata to say finished with

00:21:29.286 --> 00:21:29.846 A:middle
size.

00:21:30.726 --> 00:21:32.686 A:middle
And you'll notice here that

00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:35.896 A:middle
we've annotated this particular

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.526 A:middle
parameter with Xcode colon

00:21:37.526 --> 00:21:38.406 A:middle
size-in-bytes.

00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:40.056 A:middle
And what this does is it tells

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:42.276 A:middle
Xcode and Instruments that this

00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:43.676 A:middle
argument should be treated as a

00:21:43.676 --> 00:21:45.566 A:middle
size-in-bytes for both display

00:21:45.716 --> 00:21:46.536 A:middle
and analysis.

00:21:47.756 --> 00:21:48.756 A:middle
Now these are called engineering

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:49.166 A:middle
types.

00:21:49.166 --> 00:21:50.336 A:middle
And they can be read about in

00:21:50.336 --> 00:21:51.656 A:middle
the Instruments developer help

00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:52.986 A:middle
guide which is under the help

00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:54.206 A:middle
menu in Instruments.

00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:57.676 A:middle
Now once we've completed our

00:21:57.676 --> 00:21:59.026 A:middle
downloading, we can set that

00:21:59.026 --> 00:21:59.556 A:middle
back to nil.
