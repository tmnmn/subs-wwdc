00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.496 A:middle
And then because signposts are

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.146 A:middle
part of the OSLog functionality,

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:05.946 A:middle
we're going to create a log

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:06.276 A:middle
handle.

00:05:06.796 --> 00:05:08.406 A:middle
Here, this log handle takes two

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:09.746 A:middle
arguments, a subsystem and a

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:10.296 A:middle
category.

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:13.896 A:middle
The subsystem is just probably

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:14.566 A:middle
the same throughout your

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:15.096 A:middle
project.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:16.596 A:middle
It looks a lot like your bundle

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:16.676 A:middle
ID.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:18.666 A:middle
And it represents the component

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:19.996 A:middle
or the piece of software, maybe

00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:20.776 A:middle
the framework that you're

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:21.246 A:middle
working on.

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:24.726 A:middle
The category is used to relate

00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:27.266 A:middle
-- to group related operations

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:28.586 A:middle
together or related signposts.

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
And you'll see why that could be

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:33.096 A:middle
useful later in the session.

00:05:33.256 --> 00:05:34.596 A:middle
Once we have that log handle,

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:36.316 A:middle
we're just going to make two

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:37.516 A:middle
calls to os signpost.

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:38.536 A:middle
One with .begin.

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:39.036 A:middle
One with .end.

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:41.486 A:middle
We're going to pass that log

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:42.876 A:middle
handle into those calls.

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:44.566 A:middle
And then for the third argument,

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:46.686 A:middle
we have a signpost name.

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:49.396 A:middle
The signpost name is a string

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:51.156 A:middle
literal that identifies the

00:05:51.186 --> 00:05:52.996 A:middle
interval that identifies the

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:54.246 A:middle
operation that we're interested

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:54.676 A:middle
in measuring.

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:57.326 A:middle
That string literal is used to

00:05:57.326 --> 00:05:59.346 A:middle
match up the begin point that

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:00.806 A:middle
we've annotated or that gets
