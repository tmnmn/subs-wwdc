00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:00.806 A:middle
we've annotated or that gets

00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:02.756 A:middle
marked up with that os signpost

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:04.606 A:middle
begin called and the end point.

00:06:05.026 --> 00:06:07.416 A:middle
So on our timeline, it just

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:08.086 A:middle
looks like this.

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:09.676 A:middle
At the beginning of each piece

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:11.696 A:middle
of work, we've dropped an os

00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:12.246 A:middle
signpost.

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:13.336 A:middle
At the end of each piece of

00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:14.306 A:middle
work, we've dropped an os

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:14.776 A:middle
signpost.

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:16.646 A:middle
And because those string

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:17.756 A:middle
literals at the begin and end

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:19.286 A:middle
call sites line up with each

00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:20.526 A:middle
other, we can match those two

00:06:20.526 --> 00:06:20.856 A:middle
together.

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:23.266 A:middle
But what if we're interested in

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.346 A:middle
also measuring the entire amount

00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:26.836 A:middle
of time the whole operation,

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:27.866 A:middle
that whole refresh took?

00:06:28.526 --> 00:06:31.236 A:middle
Well, in our code, we're just

00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:32.966 A:middle
going to add another pair of os

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:34.646 A:middle
signpost begin and end calls.

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:35.346 A:middle
Pretty simple.

00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:37.196 A:middle
And this time I've given it a

00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:38.446 A:middle
different string literal, so a

00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:39.756 A:middle
different signpost name.

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:41.616 A:middle
This time refresh panel to

00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:43.206 A:middle
indicate that this is a separate

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:44.486 A:middle
interval, separate from the one

00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:45.166 A:middle
inside the loop.

00:06:47.236 --> 00:06:50.536 A:middle
In our timeline, we're just

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:51.846 A:middle
marking two additional

00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:52.656 A:middle
signposts.

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:55.606 A:middle
And that matching string literal

00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:57.296 A:middle
of refresh panel will let the

00:06:57.296 --> 00:06:58.426 A:middle
system know that those two

00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:01.156 A:middle
points are associated with each
