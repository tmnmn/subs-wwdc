00:09:59.776 --> 00:10:00.666 A:middle
worked on, the element.

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:03.436 A:middle
And then I simply pass those

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.226 A:middle
signpost IDs into the call sites

00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:07.126 A:middle
and we're done.

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:10.706 A:middle
You can think of signpost as

00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:12.146 A:middle
being organized as a kind of

00:10:12.146 --> 00:10:13.846 A:middle
classification or hierarchy.

00:10:14.336 --> 00:10:14.566 A:middle
Right.

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:16.616 A:middle
All these operations are related

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.936 A:middle
together by the log handle

00:10:18.036 --> 00:10:19.396 A:middle
meaning that log category.

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:21.456 A:middle
And then for each operation that

00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:22.706 A:middle
we're interested in, we've given

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:23.616 A:middle
it a signpost name.

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:26.786 A:middle
Then because those signposts

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:28.256 A:middle
could overlap with each other,

00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:29.626 A:middle
we've given them that signpost

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:32.016 A:middle
ID that tells the system that

00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:34.656 A:middle
that's a specific instance of

00:10:34.656 --> 00:10:35.136 A:middle
that interval.

00:10:36.596 --> 00:10:39.396 A:middle
This interface was built

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.836 A:middle
specifically to be flexible so

00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:44.196 A:middle
you control all the arguments

00:10:44.196 --> 00:10:45.996 A:middle
into your begin site and your

00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:46.416 A:middle
end site.

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:47.956 A:middle
You control that signpost name,

00:10:47.956 --> 00:10:49.466 A:middle
the log handle you give it, and

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.036 A:middle
the ID.

00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:52.276 A:middle
We've done this because as long

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.966 A:middle
as you can give the same

00:10:54.126 --> 00:10:55.656 A:middle
arguments at the begin site and

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:57.406 A:middle
the end site, those two

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:58.756 A:middle
signposts will get matched with

00:10:58.756 --> 00:10:59.126 A:middle
each other.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:00.576 A:middle
That means your begin and end
