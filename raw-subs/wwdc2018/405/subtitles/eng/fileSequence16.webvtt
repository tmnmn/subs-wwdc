00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:00.596 A:middle
that initialization conditional.

00:16:01.076 --> 00:16:02.866 A:middle
So I'm either going to assign it

00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:04.546 A:middle
to the normal os log constructor

00:16:05.066 --> 00:16:05.906 A:middle
or I'm going to assign it to

00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:07.196 A:middle
that disabled log handle.

00:16:07.776 --> 00:16:11.126 A:middle
If we take the first path, all

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.776 A:middle
the os signpost calls will work

00:16:12.776 --> 00:16:14.546 A:middle
as I described, but if we take

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:15.996 A:middle
the second path, those os

00:16:15.996 --> 00:16:17.256 A:middle
signpost calls will turn into

00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:18.026 A:middle
near no-ops.

00:16:18.876 --> 00:16:21.696 A:middle
So as I said before, notice that

00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:22.886 A:middle
I didn't have to call any of my

00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:24.196 A:middle
call -- I didn't have to change

00:16:24.196 --> 00:16:25.126 A:middle
any of my call sites.

00:16:25.126 --> 00:16:25.976 A:middle
I only had to change the

00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:26.756 A:middle
initialization.

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:29.346 A:middle
And I made the initialization

00:16:29.346 --> 00:16:31.066 A:middle
conditional on an environment

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:31.446 A:middle
variable.

00:16:31.696 --> 00:16:32.716 A:middle
This is the kind of thing that

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:34.046 A:middle
you can set up in your Xcode

00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:35.136 A:middle
scheme while you're debugging

00:16:35.136 --> 00:16:37.236 A:middle
your program.

00:16:37.836 --> 00:16:39.126 A:middle
Now I said you didn't have to

00:16:39.126 --> 00:16:40.346 A:middle
change in the call sites, but

00:16:40.346 --> 00:16:41.326 A:middle
maybe you have some

00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:42.916 A:middle
functionality that is

00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:44.506 A:middle
instrumentation specific.

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:46.346 A:middle
That is, it might be expensive

00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:47.586 A:middle
but it might only be used for

00:16:47.586 --> 00:16:48.086 A:middle
while debugging.

00:16:48.926 --> 00:16:50.976 A:middle
So in that case, you can check a

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.486 A:middle
particular log handle to see if

00:16:52.486 --> 00:16:53.736 A:middle
signposts are turned on for it

00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:55.126 A:middle
with the signposts enabled

00:16:55.126 --> 00:16:55.536 A:middle
property.

00:16:56.036 --> 00:16:57.256 A:middle
The signposts enabled property

00:16:57.256 --> 00:16:58.656 A:middle
can then be used to gate that

00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:00.526 A:middle
additional operation.
