00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:01.656 A:middle
Now this is often called

00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:02.376 A:middle
windowed mode.

00:28:03.206 --> 00:28:04.736 A:middle
And what it tells the operating

00:28:04.736 --> 00:28:05.416 A:middle
system and the recording

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:07.416 A:middle
technology is that we don't need

00:28:07.416 --> 00:28:08.306 A:middle
every single event.

00:28:08.306 --> 00:28:09.386 A:middle
We just want the last five

00:28:09.386 --> 00:28:10.046 A:middle
seconds worth.

00:28:10.366 --> 00:28:11.786 A:middle
And when you do that,

00:28:11.786 --> 00:28:12.946 A:middle
Instruments will step out of the

00:28:12.946 --> 00:28:14.066 A:middle
way and let the operating system

00:28:14.066 --> 00:28:15.416 A:middle
do what it does.

00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:16.966 A:middle
Now this is a very common mode.

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:18.296 A:middle
We use this in system trace.

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:19.976 A:middle
We use this in metal system

00:28:19.976 --> 00:28:20.906 A:middle
trace and the new game

00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:21.806 A:middle
performance template.

00:28:22.276 --> 00:28:23.736 A:middle
And so it's a very common way to

00:28:23.736 --> 00:28:25.136 A:middle
look for stutters and hangs in

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:25.776 A:middle
your application.

00:28:25.846 --> 00:28:26.646 A:middle
All right.

00:28:27.256 --> 00:28:30.916 A:middle
So that is our os signpost

00:28:30.996 --> 00:28:31.426 A:middle
instrument.

00:28:32.756 --> 00:28:34.416 A:middle
Now let's talk about points of

00:28:34.416 --> 00:28:34.756 A:middle
interest.

00:28:36.046 --> 00:28:38.216 A:middle
Now if we come back to our

00:28:38.326 --> 00:28:39.476 A:middle
Trailblazer application here,

00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:43.176 A:middle
you notice that when I tap on a

00:28:43.176 --> 00:28:45.166 A:middle
trail, it pushes a detail.

00:28:46.026 --> 00:28:47.326 A:middle
If I go back and tap on a

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.676 A:middle
different trail, it'll push a

00:28:48.676 --> 00:28:49.316 A:middle
different detail.

00:28:50.476 --> 00:28:53.186 A:middle
Now it would be great if we

00:28:53.326 --> 00:28:55.026 A:middle
could track every time these

00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:56.516 A:middle
detail views come forward

00:28:56.896 --> 00:28:57.986 A:middle
because then we can tell what

00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.266 A:middle
our user is trying to do, and we

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
can tell where our user is in
