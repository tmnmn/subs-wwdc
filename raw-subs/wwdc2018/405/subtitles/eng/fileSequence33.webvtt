00:33:00.226 --> 00:33:01.746 A:middle
we're trying to do is answer

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:02.716 A:middle
that question I was asking

00:33:02.716 --> 00:33:04.146 A:middle
before of how many of these

00:33:04.146 --> 00:33:05.636 A:middle
things are actually running in

00:33:05.636 --> 00:33:06.096 A:middle
parallel?

00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:07.656 A:middle
Well, if you want to take a look

00:33:07.656 --> 00:33:08.506 A:middle
at the intervals running in

00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:09.736 A:middle
parallel, you just scrub the

00:33:09.736 --> 00:33:11.876 A:middle
inspection head over here

00:33:11.876 --> 00:33:13.216 A:middle
through time, and you can see

00:33:13.216 --> 00:33:14.886 A:middle
exactly what is intersecting

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.976 A:middle
that inspection head at any

00:33:16.976 --> 00:33:18.196 A:middle
given point in time.

00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:20.016 A:middle
So it's a great and a different

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:21.556 A:middle
way to look at your signpost

00:33:21.556 --> 00:33:21.746 A:middle
data.

00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:24.556 A:middle
Now if you are working with

00:33:24.556 --> 00:33:26.056 A:middle
others on a project or you're

00:33:26.056 --> 00:33:26.776 A:middle
part of the development

00:33:26.776 --> 00:33:28.606 A:middle
community, using a custom

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:29.646 A:middle
instrument is a great way to

00:33:29.646 --> 00:33:31.606 A:middle
take the signpost data and

00:33:31.606 --> 00:33:33.336 A:middle
reshape it in a way that someone

00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:35.286 A:middle
else can use and interpret

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:36.126 A:middle
without having to know the

00:33:36.126 --> 00:33:37.956 A:middle
details of how your code works

00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:38.926 A:middle
so they are a very important

00:33:38.926 --> 00:33:39.216 A:middle
feature.

00:33:39.576 --> 00:33:42.746 A:middle
Now the great news is that to

00:33:42.746 --> 00:33:44.246 A:middle
create an instrument like that,

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.926 A:middle
the entire package definition is

00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:51.636 A:middle
about 115 lines of XML and so

00:33:51.716 --> 00:33:53.386 A:middle
custom instruments is very

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:55.236 A:middle
expressive and very powerful but

00:33:55.236 --> 00:33:56.506 A:middle
also very easy.

00:33:57.466 --> 00:33:59.876 A:middle
And that is the conclusion of

00:33:59.876 --> 00:34:00.226 A:middle
our demo.
