00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:02.596 A:middle
and in C, but the coolest thing

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.236 A:middle
is we've integrated them with

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:04.936 A:middle
Instruments.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.606 A:middle
So that means Instruments can

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:07.766 A:middle
take the data that signposts

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.936 A:middle
produce and give you a deep

00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.356 A:middle
understanding of what it is your

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:12.136 A:middle
program is doing.

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:15.476 A:middle
So first a little history.

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.396 A:middle
We introduced OSLog a couple of

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:18.926 A:middle
years ago.

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:21.826 A:middle
It's our modern take on a

00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:22.746 A:middle
logging facility.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:23.986 A:middle
It's our way of getting

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.596 A:middle
debugging information out of the

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:26.076 A:middle
system.

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:29.186 A:middle
And it was built with our goals

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:31.316 A:middle
of efficiency and privacy in

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:31.586 A:middle
mind.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:34.146 A:middle
Here you can see an example of

00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:35.796 A:middle
OSLog code where I've just

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:37.256 A:middle
created a simple log handle and

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.566 A:middle
posted a hello world to it.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.016 A:middle
Signposts extend the OSLog API,

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:44.536 A:middle
but they do it for the

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:45.576 A:middle
performance use case.

00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:46.486 A:middle
And that means they are

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.156 A:middle
conveying performance related

00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:49.676 A:middle
information, and they're

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.026 A:middle
integrated with our developer

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:52.846 A:middle
tools and that means you can

00:02:52.936 --> 00:02:53.876 A:middle
annotate your code with

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:55.486 A:middle
signposts and then pull up

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:56.546 A:middle
Instruments and see something

00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:57.176 A:middle
like this.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:02:59.866 A:middle
So Instruments is showing you
