00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:01.566 A:middle
But you may want to be able to

00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:03.066 A:middle
turn your signposts off.

00:15:03.406 --> 00:15:05.186 A:middle
Maybe you want to eliminate as

00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:06.836 A:middle
much overhead as you can from a

00:15:06.836 --> 00:15:07.656 A:middle
particular code path.

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:10.186 A:middle
Or you might have two categories

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:11.386 A:middle
of signposts, both of which are

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:13.126 A:middle
super-high volume and you really

00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:14.546 A:middle
are only interested in debugging

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.016 A:middle
one or the other at a given

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.096 A:middle
point in time.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.536 A:middle
Well, to do that we're going to

00:15:19.536 --> 00:15:20.806 A:middle
take advantage of a feature of

00:15:20.856 --> 00:15:23.266 A:middle
OSLog, the disabled log handle.

00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:25.896 A:middle
So the disabled log handle is a

00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:27.226 A:middle
simple handle.

00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:30.036 A:middle
And what it does is every OSLog

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.846 A:middle
and os signpost call made

00:15:31.846 --> 00:15:33.766 A:middle
against that handle will just

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.226 A:middle
turn into something very close

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:35.736 A:middle
to a no-op.

00:15:36.556 --> 00:15:38.186 A:middle
In fact, if you adopt this in C,

00:15:38.466 --> 00:15:39.576 A:middle
we'll even do the check for you

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:41.506 A:middle
in line and then we won't even

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:42.346 A:middle
evaluate the rest of the

00:15:42.346 --> 00:15:42.856 A:middle
arguments.

00:15:43.546 --> 00:15:45.246 A:middle
So you can just change this

00:15:45.246 --> 00:15:46.156 A:middle
handle at runtime.

00:15:46.566 --> 00:15:47.746 A:middle
Let me show you an example.

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:51.226 A:middle
So we're going to go back to the

00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:52.816 A:middle
very first example code that we

00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:53.146 A:middle
had.

00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:54.846 A:middle
And you see that initialization

00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:56.066 A:middle
of that log handle up top.

00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:59.066 A:middle
Well, instead I'm going to make

00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:00.596 A:middle
that initialization conditional.
