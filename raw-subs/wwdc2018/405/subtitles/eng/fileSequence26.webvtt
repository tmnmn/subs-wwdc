00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
and then the size.

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.516 A:middle
It would be great if we could

00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:04.536 A:middle
total that argument up.

00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:06.546 A:middle
So if you want to do that, you

00:26:06.546 --> 00:26:07.256 A:middle
can come over here to the

00:26:07.256 --> 00:26:09.286 A:middle
summary of metadata statistics.

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:11.696 A:middle
You can see that we have it

00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:13.276 A:middle
broken down by the subsystem,

00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:15.326 A:middle
the category, and then the

00:26:15.326 --> 00:26:17.076 A:middle
format string and then below the

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:18.636 A:middle
format string, the arguments

00:26:18.636 --> 00:26:19.606 A:middle
within that format string.

00:26:19.816 --> 00:26:20.996 A:middle
And since our format string only

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.926 A:middle
has one, that's simply arg0.

00:26:22.926 --> 00:26:26.216 A:middle
Now Instruments has totaled this

00:26:26.216 --> 00:26:26.416 A:middle
up.

00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:27.896 A:middle
And it knows that this is a

00:26:27.896 --> 00:26:28.776 A:middle
size-in-bytes.

00:26:28.776 --> 00:26:29.866 A:middle
And so it gives us a nice

00:26:29.866 --> 00:26:31.986 A:middle
calculation of 80 megabytes.

00:26:32.036 --> 00:26:33.626 A:middle
So we've downloaded 80 megabytes

00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:34.856 A:middle
of image data total.

00:26:35.046 --> 00:26:37.666 A:middle
Now you can see the different

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:38.186 A:middle
columns here.

00:26:38.186 --> 00:26:39.196 A:middle
You've got it min, max, average,

00:26:39.196 --> 00:26:40.166 A:middle
and standard deviation.

00:26:40.256 --> 00:26:41.776 A:middle
So this is a great way to take a

00:26:41.846 --> 00:26:43.976 A:middle
look at just statistical

00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:45.556 A:middle
analysis of the values that

00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:46.636 A:middle
you're conveying through your

00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:47.706 A:middle
metadata.

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:49.296 A:middle
Now Shane mentioned that

00:26:49.296 --> 00:26:51.766 A:middle
signposts were very lightweight

00:26:52.056 --> 00:26:54.596 A:middle
and that is totally true except

00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:55.916 A:middle
when you run Instruments the way

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:56.816 A:middle
I just ran Instruments.

00:26:57.016 --> 00:27:00.056 A:middle
In what we call immediate mode,
