00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:02.606 A:middle
Now today I want to show you and

00:18:02.606 --> 00:18:04.036 A:middle
demonstrate for you three new

00:18:04.036 --> 00:18:05.016 A:middle
important features in

00:18:05.016 --> 00:18:06.776 A:middle
Instruments 10 to help you work

00:18:06.776 --> 00:18:07.616 A:middle
with signpost data.

00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:09.896 A:middle
The first is the new os signpost

00:18:09.896 --> 00:18:10.436 A:middle
instrument.

00:18:10.686 --> 00:18:11.656 A:middle
And that instrument allows you

00:18:11.656 --> 00:18:13.186 A:middle
to record, visualize, and

00:18:13.186 --> 00:18:14.986 A:middle
analyze all of the signpost

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:16.736 A:middle
activity in your application.

00:18:17.636 --> 00:18:19.446 A:middle
The next feature is points of

00:18:19.446 --> 00:18:20.036 A:middle
interest.

00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:20.846 A:middle
I'll talk a little bit about

00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:22.316 A:middle
what points of interest are and

00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:23.946 A:middle
when you might want to emit one.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.026 A:middle
And then I'm also going to show

00:18:26.026 --> 00:18:27.636 A:middle
you the new custom instruments

00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:29.086 A:middle
feature and how you can use it

00:18:29.086 --> 00:18:31.946 A:middle
with os signposts to get a more,

00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:34.536 A:middle
I guess, refined presentation of

00:18:34.536 --> 00:18:35.386 A:middle
your signposts.

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.616 A:middle
So let's take a look at that in

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:38.346 A:middle
a demonstration.

00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:39.216 A:middle
Okay.

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:44.526 A:middle
Now to start with, we're going

00:18:44.526 --> 00:18:46.206 A:middle
to take a look at our example

00:18:46.206 --> 00:18:47.106 A:middle
application first.

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:48.386 A:middle
And that is our Trailblazer

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:48.986 A:middle
application.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.016 A:middle
This app is -- shows you the

00:18:53.016 --> 00:18:54.056 A:middle
local hiking trails.

00:18:54.476 --> 00:18:56.626 A:middle
And it basically downloads these

00:18:56.656 --> 00:18:58.376 A:middle
beautiful images for you as we

00:18:58.376 --> 00:18:58.756 A:middle
scroll.

00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:01.476 A:middle
Now you'll notice that initially
