00:29:59.856 --> 00:30:01.636 A:middle
a time profile, you can see that

00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:03.636 A:middle
we have our points of interest

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:04.576 A:middle
instrument automatically

00:30:04.576 --> 00:30:04.976 A:middle
included.

00:30:05.146 --> 00:30:08.706 A:middle
And if we do a recording and we

00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:11.246 A:middle
do that same basic action, we go

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:12.636 A:middle
into the Matt Davis Trail and

00:30:12.636 --> 00:30:13.426 A:middle
then we'll come back here to

00:30:13.426 --> 00:30:15.536 A:middle
Skyline Trail and then we'll go

00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:17.466 A:middle
back and we'll do one more for

00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:17.896 A:middle
good measure.

00:30:19.366 --> 00:30:20.856 A:middle
Now when you go back to

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:25.176 A:middle
Instruments, you can see that we

00:30:25.176 --> 00:30:26.276 A:middle
have those points of interest

00:30:26.606 --> 00:30:27.806 A:middle
prominently displayed.

00:30:27.806 --> 00:30:29.776 A:middle
So you can see where your user

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.036 A:middle
was in the navigation of your

00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:31.236 A:middle
app.

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:32.406 A:middle
And you can correlate this with

00:30:32.406 --> 00:30:33.316 A:middle
other performance data.

00:30:33.986 --> 00:30:34.986 A:middle
And so points of interest are

00:30:34.986 --> 00:30:37.236 A:middle
really a way for you to pick and

00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:38.626 A:middle
choose some of the most

00:30:38.626 --> 00:30:40.546 A:middle
important points of interest in

00:30:40.546 --> 00:30:42.016 A:middle
your application and make them

00:30:42.016 --> 00:30:44.036 A:middle
available to every developer

00:30:44.036 --> 00:30:45.446 A:middle
that's on your team or in your

00:30:45.446 --> 00:30:46.306 A:middle
development community.

00:30:46.566 --> 00:30:47.736 A:middle
And they can be seen right here

00:30:47.736 --> 00:30:48.596 A:middle
in the points of interest.

00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:50.156 A:middle
All right.

00:30:50.156 --> 00:30:51.756 A:middle
So that is the points of

00:30:51.756 --> 00:30:53.596 A:middle
interest instrument and how you

00:30:53.596 --> 00:30:54.956 A:middle
create points of interest from

00:30:54.956 --> 00:30:55.646 A:middle
signposts.

00:30:56.966 --> 00:30:58.926 A:middle
Now another great feature of

00:30:59.276 --> 00:31:01.006 A:middle
Instruments 10 is the ability
