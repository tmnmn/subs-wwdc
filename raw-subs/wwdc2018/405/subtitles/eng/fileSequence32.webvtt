00:31:59.036 --> 00:32:00.656 A:middle
Now the presentation here is

00:32:00.656 --> 00:32:01.646 A:middle
significantly different.

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:02.946 A:middle
So let's zoom in and take a look

00:32:02.946 --> 00:32:04.676 A:middle
at it.

00:32:04.676 --> 00:32:07.076 A:middle
You'll notice here on the left,

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:08.066 A:middle
instead of breaking it down by

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:09.396 A:middle
signpost name, we've broken it

00:32:09.396 --> 00:32:10.376 A:middle
down by the image being

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:10.906 A:middle
downloaded.

00:32:11.416 --> 00:32:13.466 A:middle
So now we can see that image two

00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:16.606 A:middle
was downloaded at this point and

00:32:16.606 --> 00:32:17.406 A:middle
at this point.

00:32:18.256 --> 00:32:20.456 A:middle
Now we've labeled each one with

00:32:20.716 --> 00:32:21.896 A:middle
the size in megabytes of the

00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:22.386 A:middle
download.

00:32:22.996 --> 00:32:25.546 A:middle
And we've also colored them red

00:32:25.546 --> 00:32:27.576 A:middle
if the download size is larger

00:32:27.576 --> 00:32:28.896 A:middle
than 3 1/2 megabytes.

00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:31.846 A:middle
So this is a custom graph that

00:32:31.846 --> 00:32:33.226 A:middle
we created as part of our custom

00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:33.636 A:middle
instrument.

00:32:33.956 --> 00:32:35.536 A:middle
Now we've also defined some

00:32:35.536 --> 00:32:36.446 A:middle
details down here.

00:32:36.536 --> 00:32:38.516 A:middle
We've got a very simple list of

00:32:38.516 --> 00:32:39.716 A:middle
our download events.

00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:41.266 A:middle
And, again, you can navigate

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:42.516 A:middle
through the trace with those.

00:32:43.476 --> 00:32:46.116 A:middle
And we also have -- let me see

00:32:46.116 --> 00:32:47.036 A:middle
if I can get this back into

00:32:47.096 --> 00:32:47.796 A:middle
focus here.

00:32:47.996 --> 00:32:50.846 A:middle
We also have a summary for all

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:51.466 A:middle
the downloads.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:52.096 A:middle
Very simple.

00:32:52.506 --> 00:32:53.596 A:middle
We just want to do a count and a

00:32:53.596 --> 00:32:54.016 A:middle
sum.

00:32:54.226 --> 00:32:56.136 A:middle
And then we also have this cool

00:32:56.136 --> 00:32:57.266 A:middle
thing called Timeslice.

00:32:58.026 --> 00:32:59.806 A:middle
And in a Timeslice view, what
