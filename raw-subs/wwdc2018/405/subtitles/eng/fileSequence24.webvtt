00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:01.296 A:middle
That means that our cancellation

00:24:01.296 --> 00:24:01.646 A:middle
worked.

00:24:01.646 --> 00:24:04.276 A:middle
And if we want to confirm that,

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.346 A:middle
we can come in here and you can

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:07.606 A:middle
see that a lot of these

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:09.536 A:middle
intervals have metadata that

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:11.346 A:middle
says that it was cancelled in

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:11.936 A:middle
the download.

00:24:12.706 --> 00:24:14.506 A:middle
Now if you want to take -- if

00:24:14.506 --> 00:24:16.716 A:middle
you want to look at a numerical

00:24:17.076 --> 00:24:18.346 A:middle
-- or let's say you want to look

00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:19.586 A:middle
at the durations of these

00:24:19.586 --> 00:24:22.196 A:middle
intervals then you can come down

00:24:22.246 --> 00:24:23.166 A:middle
here to the summary of

00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:23.726 A:middle
intervals.

00:24:24.126 --> 00:24:26.726 A:middle
And we see a breakdown by

00:24:26.726 --> 00:24:28.886 A:middle
category and then by signpost

00:24:28.886 --> 00:24:30.616 A:middle
name and then by the start

00:24:30.616 --> 00:24:32.026 A:middle
message and then by the end

00:24:32.026 --> 00:24:32.456 A:middle
message.

00:24:33.386 --> 00:24:35.326 A:middle
So if we make this a little bit

00:24:35.326 --> 00:24:38.056 A:middle
smaller, you can see that we

00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:41.306 A:middle
made 93 image download requests.

00:24:42.236 --> 00:24:43.986 A:middle
Of those, 12 were for location

00:24:43.986 --> 00:24:44.236 A:middle
one.

00:24:45.426 --> 00:24:46.506 A:middle
Of those 12, seven were

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:48.776 A:middle
cancelled and five finished with

00:24:48.806 --> 00:24:50.736 A:middle
a size of 3.31 megabytes.

00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:53.036 A:middle
Now if you look over here, these

00:24:53.036 --> 00:24:54.716 A:middle
are the statistics about our

00:24:54.716 --> 00:24:55.386 A:middle
durations.

00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:58.496 A:middle
And you can see that the minimum

00:24:58.736 --> 00:25:00.506 A:middle
and the average of the cancelled
