00:26:57.016 --> 00:27:00.056 A:middle
In what we call immediate mode,

00:27:00.056 --> 00:27:01.166 A:middle
which is the default recording

00:27:01.166 --> 00:27:03.126 A:middle
mode, Instruments is trying to

00:27:03.126 --> 00:27:05.876 A:middle
show and record the data in near

00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:06.416 A:middle
real time.

00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:07.926 A:middle
And so when it goes into

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:09.556 A:middle
immediate mode recording, all

00:27:09.626 --> 00:27:11.636 A:middle
the signposts have to be sent

00:27:11.636 --> 00:27:12.826 A:middle
directly to Instruments.

00:27:13.326 --> 00:27:15.106 A:middle
And we have to bypass all of

00:27:15.106 --> 00:27:16.176 A:middle
those optimizations that you get

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:18.136 A:middle
from buffering in the operating

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:18.486 A:middle
system.

00:27:19.196 --> 00:27:21.966 A:middle
Now with our signposts -- with

00:27:21.966 --> 00:27:23.576 A:middle
our signposts application here,

00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:25.546 A:middle
we're not really emitting enough

00:27:25.546 --> 00:27:27.176 A:middle
intervals to really notice that

00:27:27.176 --> 00:27:29.186 A:middle
overhead, but if you have a game

00:27:29.186 --> 00:27:30.156 A:middle
engine and you want to emit

00:27:30.156 --> 00:27:32.146 A:middle
thousands of signposts per

00:27:32.146 --> 00:27:34.106 A:middle
second, that overhead will start

00:27:34.106 --> 00:27:34.836 A:middle
to build up.

00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:37.336 A:middle
So in order to work around that,

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.376 A:middle
what you can do is change the

00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:41.176 A:middle
recording mode of Instruments

00:27:41.616 --> 00:27:42.736 A:middle
before you take your recording.

00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:45.016 A:middle
And the way you do that is by

00:27:45.016 --> 00:27:46.956 A:middle
holding down on the record

00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:48.656 A:middle
button and selecting recording

00:27:48.656 --> 00:27:49.266 A:middle
options.

00:27:50.706 --> 00:27:52.496 A:middle
And then in this section here

00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:55.326 A:middle
for the global options, you can

00:27:55.326 --> 00:27:56.566 A:middle
see that we have our immediate

00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:57.176 A:middle
mode selected.

00:27:57.496 --> 00:27:58.976 A:middle
And we can change that to last

00:27:58.976 --> 00:27:59.876 A:middle
five second mode.
