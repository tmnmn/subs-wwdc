00:24:58.736 --> 00:25:00.506 A:middle
and the average of the cancelled

00:25:01.106 --> 00:25:02.966 A:middle
intervals is significantly

00:25:02.966 --> 00:25:04.816 A:middle
smaller than when we finished

00:25:05.066 --> 00:25:06.056 A:middle
with the full downloads.

00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:07.086 A:middle
And that's exactly what you

00:25:07.086 --> 00:25:08.466 A:middle
would expect to see in this

00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:08.826 A:middle
pattern.

00:25:09.866 --> 00:25:11.086 A:middle
Now if you want to see all of

00:25:11.086 --> 00:25:12.926 A:middle
the cancelled events because

00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:13.966 A:middle
you're interested in seeing

00:25:13.966 --> 00:25:16.186 A:middle
those, you can put this -- focus

00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:19.586 A:middle
arrow and it will take you to a

00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:21.586 A:middle
list view where you can see all

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:24.186 A:middle
the places where location one

00:25:24.186 --> 00:25:25.626 A:middle
had an end message of cancelled.

00:25:26.386 --> 00:25:28.156 A:middle
And as we go through this,

00:25:28.156 --> 00:25:29.146 A:middle
you'll see that the inspection

00:25:29.146 --> 00:25:30.636 A:middle
head on the top of the trace

00:25:31.016 --> 00:25:32.566 A:middle
will move forward to each one of

00:25:32.566 --> 00:25:33.206 A:middle
those intervals.

00:25:33.336 --> 00:25:35.066 A:middle
So you can track all the failure

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:36.086 A:middle
cases if that's what you're

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:36.556 A:middle
interested in.

00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:40.076 A:middle
Now that's a great way to view

00:25:40.316 --> 00:25:42.756 A:middle
the times of those intervals,

00:25:42.756 --> 00:25:44.096 A:middle
the timing of those intervals.

00:25:44.456 --> 00:25:46.926 A:middle
But what if you wanted to do an

00:25:46.926 --> 00:25:48.536 A:middle
analysis of the metadata?

00:25:49.316 --> 00:25:50.886 A:middle
What if you wanted to determine

00:25:51.046 --> 00:25:53.426 A:middle
how many bytes of image data

00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:54.406 A:middle
that we've downloaded over the

00:25:54.526 --> 00:25:54.916 A:middle
network?

00:25:55.696 --> 00:25:57.906 A:middle
Well, we've emitted metadata

00:25:57.906 --> 00:25:59.946 A:middle
messages like finished with size

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
and then the size.
