00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:00.776 A:middle
triggering event like maybe a

00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:02.336 A:middle
user interface interaction like

00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:04.196 A:middle
somebody has just swiped to

00:14:04.196 --> 00:14:05.276 A:middle
update that interface.

00:14:05.816 --> 00:14:07.206 A:middle
Although, if you're really

00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:08.306 A:middle
investigating in a performance

00:14:08.336 --> 00:14:09.846 A:middle
problem, they might be swiping a

00:14:09.846 --> 00:14:11.916 A:middle
lot so this might be what you

00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:12.436 A:middle
see instead.

00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:17.136 A:middle
If you have signpost enabled,

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:18.686 A:middle
they're usually on by default,

00:14:19.396 --> 00:14:20.366 A:middle
but I'd like to talk about

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:21.786 A:middle
conditionally turning them on

00:14:21.836 --> 00:14:22.216 A:middle
and off.

00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:25.546 A:middle
First I'd like to emphasize that

00:14:25.546 --> 00:14:26.766 A:middle
we built signpost to be

00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:27.536 A:middle
lightweight.

00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:29.986 A:middle
That means we've done a lot of

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:31.776 A:middle
work to optimize them at emit

00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:32.146 A:middle
time.

00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:33.376 A:middle
We've done this through some

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:34.796 A:middle
compiler optimizations that make

00:14:34.796 --> 00:14:36.546 A:middle
sure that work is done in front

00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:37.436 A:middle
instead of runtime.

00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:39.416 A:middle
We've also deferred a lot of our

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:40.796 A:middle
work so that they're done on the

00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:41.656 A:middle
Instruments backend.

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:43.406 A:middle
And that means that while

00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:44.376 A:middle
signposts are being emitted,

00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:45.796 A:middle
they should take very few system

00:14:45.796 --> 00:14:46.416 A:middle
resources.

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:47.896 A:middle
We've done this because we want

00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:49.456 A:middle
to minimize the impact to

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:50.436 A:middle
whatever your code is running.

00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:52.096 A:middle
And we've also done it because

00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:53.236 A:middle
we want to make sure that even

00:14:53.236 --> 00:14:55.076 A:middle
if you have very small time

00:14:55.076 --> 00:14:56.946 A:middle
span, you can emit a lot of

00:14:56.946 --> 00:14:57.866 A:middle
signposts to get some

00:14:57.866 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
fine-grained measurements.
