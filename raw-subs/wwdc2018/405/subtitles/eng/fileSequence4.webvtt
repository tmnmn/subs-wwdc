00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.626 A:middle
that you're doing the work to

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:01.346 A:middle
grab an asset.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:02.456 A:middle
And after you've gotten them

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:04.296 A:middle
all, the interface is refreshed.

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:07.116 A:middle
What a signpost allows us to do

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:09.466 A:middle
is to mark the beginning and the

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.196 A:middle
end of a piece of work and then

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:12.586 A:middle
associate those two points in

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.046 A:middle
time, those two log events with

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:14.476 A:middle
each other.

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:18.086 A:middle
And they do it with an os

00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:19.106 A:middle
signpost function call.

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:20.516 A:middle
There are two calls.

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:22.806 A:middle
One with .begin and one with

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:23.296 A:middle
.end.

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:25.776 A:middle
Here I've represented the begin

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:26.976 A:middle
with that arrow with the b

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:27.526 A:middle
underneath it.

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.446 A:middle
And I represented the end with

00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:31.626 A:middle
the arrow with the e under it.

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:32.936 A:middle
And then we're going to relate

00:04:32.936 --> 00:04:34.126 A:middle
those two points to each other

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:36.296 A:middle
to give you a sense of what the

00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:37.486 A:middle
elapsed time is for that

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:37.736 A:middle
interval.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.276 A:middle
All right.

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:42.246 A:middle
In code, there's this simple

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:44.076 A:middle
implementation of that algorithm

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:45.886 A:middle
where for each element in our

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.236 A:middle
interface, we're going to fetch

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.296 A:middle
that asset and that's the piece

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:50.496 A:middle
of operation that we're

00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:51.506 A:middle
interested in measuring.

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:53.786 A:middle
So to incorporate signpost into

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:55.716 A:middle
this code base, we're going to

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:57.396 A:middle
simply import the module

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:58.986 A:middle
os.signpost that contains that

00:04:58.986 --> 00:04:59.636 A:middle
functionality.
