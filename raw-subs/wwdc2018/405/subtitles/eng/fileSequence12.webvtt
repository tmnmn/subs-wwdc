00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
that %d to pass in four

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:01.556 A:middle
integers.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.846 A:middle
But because it's an OSLog format

00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:06.986 A:middle
string, I can also use it to

00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:08.316 A:middle
pass many arguments of different

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:08.626 A:middle
types.

00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:09.766 A:middle
So here I've passed in some

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.796 A:middle
floating-point numbers.

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:12.266 A:middle
And I've even used the format

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.726 A:middle
specifier to tell the system how

00:12:14.726 --> 00:12:15.736 A:middle
much precision I want.

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:19.396 A:middle
You can pass dynamic strings in

00:12:19.396 --> 00:12:20.446 A:middle
with the string literal

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:20.926 A:middle
formatter.

00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:23.086 A:middle
And that'll let us pass in

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.186 A:middle
information that comes from a

00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:25.656 A:middle
function call or comes from a

00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:26.596 A:middle
user entered piece of

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
information.

00:12:28.046 --> 00:12:30.036 A:middle
And we reference that format

00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:31.756 A:middle
string literal with a fixed

00:12:31.756 --> 00:12:33.516 A:middle
amount of storage which means

00:12:33.516 --> 00:12:34.906 A:middle
that you can feel free to make

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:36.746 A:middle
it as long and as human readable

00:12:36.746 --> 00:12:37.136 A:middle
as you like.

00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:41.356 A:middle
This human readable string is

00:12:41.356 --> 00:12:42.346 A:middle
the same one that will be

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:43.656 A:middle
rendered up in the Instruments.

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:45.246 A:middle
So you can feel free to give it

00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:45.986 A:middle
some context.

00:12:45.986 --> 00:12:47.106 A:middle
I've given it here for the

00:12:47.106 --> 00:12:48.006 A:middle
various arguments.

00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:49.866 A:middle
And Instruments will be able to

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.146 A:middle
show that full rendered string,

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.146 A:middle
or it still has programmatic

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:54.806 A:middle
access to the data that's

00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:55.486 A:middle
attached.

00:12:57.756 --> 00:12:59.816 A:middle
In addition to metadata for

00:12:59.816 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
those intervals, you may want to
