00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.266 A:middle
this beautiful visualization of

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:03.736 A:middle
a timeline of what your program

00:03:03.736 --> 00:03:04.906 A:middle
is doing and the signpost

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:05.596 A:middle
activity there.

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:07.186 A:middle
And then on the bottom there's

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.486 A:middle
that table with statistical

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.316 A:middle
aggregation and analysis of the

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.216 A:middle
signpost data, slicing and

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:15.056 A:middle
dicing to see what your

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.706 A:middle
program's behavior is really

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:17.126 A:middle
like.

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:20.476 A:middle
In this session, I'll talk about

00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:21.986 A:middle
adopting signposts into your

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:23.366 A:middle
code and show you some of what

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:24.086 A:middle
they're capable of.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:25.226 A:middle
And then we're going to

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:26.836 A:middle
demonstrate the new Instrument

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:29.436 A:middle
signpost visualization to give

00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:31.296 A:middle
you an idea how signposts and

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:33.976 A:middle
Instruments work together.

00:03:34.096 --> 00:03:34.736 A:middle
So let's start.

00:03:35.556 --> 00:03:37.856 A:middle
I'm going to start with a really

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:38.946 A:middle
basic example.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.466 A:middle
Imagine that this is your app.

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:44.586 A:middle
And what you're trying to

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.836 A:middle
investigate is the amount of

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:48.116 A:middle
time a particular part of the

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.456 A:middle
interface takes to refresh.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.856 A:middle
And you know to do that you want

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.566 A:middle
to load some images and put them

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.176 A:middle
on the screen.

00:03:54.696 --> 00:03:57.576 A:middle
So once again, an abstract,

00:03:57.576 --> 00:03:59.086 A:middle
simple view of this app might be

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.626 A:middle
that you're doing the work to
