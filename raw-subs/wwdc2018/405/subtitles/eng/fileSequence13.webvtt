00:12:59.816 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
those intervals, you may want to

00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:03.496 A:middle
add individual points in time.

00:13:04.156 --> 00:13:06.236 A:middle
That is, in addition to the

00:13:06.236 --> 00:13:08.246 A:middle
begin signpost and the end

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.356 A:middle
signpost, you may have a

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:10.726 A:middle
signpost that's not tethered to

00:13:10.786 --> 00:13:12.646 A:middle
a particular time interval but

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:14.406 A:middle
rather just some fixed moment.

00:13:14.636 --> 00:13:16.596 A:middle
And for that, we have an os

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:17.946 A:middle
signpost with the event type.

00:13:18.886 --> 00:13:20.136 A:middle
The os signpost with the event

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:21.926 A:middle
type call looks just like the

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.676 A:middle
same as the begin and end, this

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:24.966 A:middle
time with the event type.

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:27.376 A:middle
And it marks a single point in

00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:27.706 A:middle
time.

00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:29.806 A:middle
You could use this within the

00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:32.186 A:middle
context of an interval or maybe

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.266 A:middle
because you want to track

00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:34.506 A:middle
something that's independent of

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:35.606 A:middle
an interval like a user

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:36.176 A:middle
interaction.

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:39.436 A:middle
So for that fetch asset interval

00:13:39.436 --> 00:13:41.066 A:middle
we're talking about, maybe you

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.206 A:middle
want to know when you've

00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:43.556 A:middle
connected to the service that

00:13:43.596 --> 00:13:44.616 A:middle
provides that asset.

00:13:45.066 --> 00:13:45.906 A:middle
Or maybe you want to know when

00:13:45.906 --> 00:13:47.336 A:middle
you've received a few bytes of

00:13:47.336 --> 00:13:47.466 A:middle
it.

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:49.636 A:middle
You can use this to update the

00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:51.056 A:middle
status or progress of a

00:13:51.056 --> 00:13:52.556 A:middle
particular interval many times

00:13:52.596 --> 00:13:54.706 A:middle
throughout that time of that

00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:54.986 A:middle
interval.

00:13:56.426 --> 00:13:58.416 A:middle
Or you might be tracking maybe a

00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:00.776 A:middle
triggering event like maybe a
