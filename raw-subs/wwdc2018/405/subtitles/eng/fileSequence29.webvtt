00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
can tell where our user is in

00:29:00.856 --> 00:29:01.606 A:middle
the application.

00:29:02.626 --> 00:29:04.466 A:middle
Now you could certainly do this

00:29:04.466 --> 00:29:07.246 A:middle
with a signpost, but you'd have

00:29:07.296 --> 00:29:08.526 A:middle
to drag in the os signpost

00:29:08.526 --> 00:29:10.366 A:middle
instrument and record all of the

00:29:10.366 --> 00:29:11.556 A:middle
signpost activity on the

00:29:11.556 --> 00:29:12.146 A:middle
application.

00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:14.316 A:middle
And it sort of dilutes how

00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:16.456 A:middle
important these user navigation

00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:17.086 A:middle
events are.

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.386 A:middle
So what we allow you to do is

00:29:19.386 --> 00:29:20.826 A:middle
promote them to what are called

00:29:20.936 --> 00:29:21.796 A:middle
points of interest.

00:29:22.566 --> 00:29:23.746 A:middle
Now if I go to our code for the

00:29:23.746 --> 00:29:26.636 A:middle
detail controller and we look at

00:29:26.636 --> 00:29:28.406 A:middle
our viewDidAppear method, you

00:29:28.406 --> 00:29:31.006 A:middle
can see that I'm posting -- I'm

00:29:31.006 --> 00:29:32.426 A:middle
creating an os signpost event

00:29:33.076 --> 00:29:34.296 A:middle
saying that a detail appeared

00:29:34.696 --> 00:29:36.136 A:middle
and with the name of the detail.

00:29:37.186 --> 00:29:38.206 A:middle
Now this is sent to a special

00:29:38.206 --> 00:29:39.486 A:middle
log handle that we've created

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:40.516 A:middle
called points of interest.

00:29:40.986 --> 00:29:42.116 A:middle
And the way that you create that

00:29:42.556 --> 00:29:43.836 A:middle
is by creating a log handle with

00:29:43.946 --> 00:29:46.166 A:middle
your subsystem identifier and

00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:47.976 A:middle
the systems points of interest

00:29:47.976 --> 00:29:48.466 A:middle
category.

00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:49.946 A:middle
So this is a special category

00:29:49.946 --> 00:29:50.886 A:middle
that Instruments will be looking

00:29:50.886 --> 00:29:51.196 A:middle
for.

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:52.896 A:middle
And when it sees points here,

00:29:53.246 --> 00:29:55.746 A:middle
it'll place them into the points

00:29:55.786 --> 00:29:57.196 A:middle
of interest instrument.

00:29:57.336 --> 00:29:59.856 A:middle
So if we come back here and take

00:29:59.856 --> 00:30:01.636 A:middle
a time profile, you can see that
