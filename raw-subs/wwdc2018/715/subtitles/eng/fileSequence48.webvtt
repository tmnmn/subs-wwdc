00:47:59.586 --> 00:48:01.046 A:middle
and forth directly from your

00:48:01.046 --> 00:48:01.666 A:middle
application.

00:48:02.286 --> 00:48:04.456 A:middle
So to show how this works and

00:48:04.456 --> 00:48:05.996 A:middle
the effect it can have, I want

00:48:05.996 --> 00:48:08.906 A:middle
to show you a video that was

00:48:08.906 --> 00:48:11.166 A:middle
taken using the same app that

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:12.966 A:middle
Eric showed you earlier to

00:48:12.966 --> 00:48:14.816 A:middle
demonstrate UDP performance with

00:48:14.816 --> 00:48:15.816 A:middle
user space networking.

00:48:16.076 --> 00:48:18.876 A:middle
So in this example, we're going

00:48:18.876 --> 00:48:20.206 A:middle
to have two videos running

00:48:20.206 --> 00:48:21.126 A:middle
simultaneously.

00:48:21.676 --> 00:48:25.386 A:middle
The device on the left is

00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:28.866 A:middle
receiving a video stream from an

00:48:28.866 --> 00:48:30.066 A:middle
application that was written

00:48:30.066 --> 00:48:30.976 A:middle
using sockets.

00:48:32.186 --> 00:48:33.656 A:middle
And the device on the right is

00:48:33.656 --> 00:48:35.006 A:middle
going to be receiving exactly

00:48:35.006 --> 00:48:37.696 A:middle
the same video stream from a

00:48:37.696 --> 00:48:40.576 A:middle
device that has an app written

00:48:40.576 --> 00:48:42.176 A:middle
using Network.framework so it

00:48:42.176 --> 00:48:43.626 A:middle
can take advantage of the user

00:48:43.626 --> 00:48:44.906 A:middle
space networking stack.

00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:47.716 A:middle
And in this case, we're

00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:48.596 A:middle
streaming the video.

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.756 A:middle
It's just raw frames.

00:48:50.756 --> 00:48:51.436 A:middle
It's not compressed.

00:48:51.496 --> 00:48:52.526 A:middle
It's not great quality or

00:48:52.526 --> 00:48:53.606 A:middle
anything, but there's a lot of

00:48:53.606 --> 00:48:54.536 A:middle
packets going back and forth.

00:48:55.746 --> 00:48:57.126 A:middle
And we chose specifically for

00:48:57.126 --> 00:49:00.596 A:middle
this demonstration to not lower
