00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.436 A:middle
wire, and they had a static IP

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:02.486 A:middle
address, and everything was

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:03.566 A:middle
stable and simple.

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:05.506 A:middle
And today, we have these

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:07.626 A:middle
incredibly powerful devices in

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:09.666 A:middle
our pocket with multiple radios

00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:11.556 A:middle
that may be on at the same time,

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.476 A:middle
and some of them are moving from

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:14.876 A:middle
network to network, and your

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
application has to handle all

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.566 A:middle
these transitions well to

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:18.846 A:middle
provide a seamless experience to

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:19.616 A:middle
your customers.

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:24.316 A:middle
Sockets does nothing to help you

00:05:24.316 --> 00:05:24.826 A:middle
with this.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.376 A:middle
You can use routing sockets, but

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:27.916 A:middle
it's really, really difficult.

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:30.016 A:middle
We think a transport API should

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:30.426 A:middle
do better.

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:34.196 A:middle
Fortunately, on our platform as

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:35.606 A:middle
an application developer you

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:37.966 A:middle
have a great API in URLSession.

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:41.406 A:middle
URLSession handles all of these

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:42.256 A:middle
problems for you.

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.016 A:middle
It's really focused on HTTP, but

00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:46.756 A:middle
it also has stream task that

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.666 A:middle
gives you raw access to TCP and

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:49.766 A:middle
TLS connections.

00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:52.076 A:middle
Now you might be looking at

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.316 A:middle
this, and you may not have

00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:54.566 A:middle
cheated by looking at the

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.426 A:middle
description in the WWDC app.

00:05:56.996 --> 00:05:58.366 A:middle
You might think that URLSession

00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:00.626 A:middle
is built on the same primitives
