00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:01.866 A:middle
In this case, we have WiFi and

00:17:01.866 --> 00:17:02.336 A:middle
cellular.

00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:04.866 A:middle
And generally we prefer the WiFi

00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:06.685 A:middle
network because it has less cost

00:17:06.685 --> 00:17:07.296 A:middle
to the user.

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:09.406 A:middle
So we'll look at that one first.

00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:12.685 A:middle
Then we check, are there any

00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:14.136 A:middle
special configurations on this

00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:14.465 A:middle
network.

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:15.425 A:middle
Is there a VPN?

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:16.616 A:middle
Is there a proxy?

00:17:16.616 --> 00:17:18.195 A:middle
And we'll evaluate that for you.

00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:21.185 A:middle
In this case, let's say that

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:23.175 A:middle
there is a proxy configured with

00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:25.185 A:middle
an automatic configuration file

00:17:25.616 --> 00:17:28.296 A:middle
that also lets you go direct if

00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:29.656 A:middle
the proxy doesn't apply to your

00:17:29.656 --> 00:17:30.146 A:middle
connection.

00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:32.096 A:middle
So we'll evaluate both of those

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:32.536 A:middle
options.

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:34.606 A:middle
We'll check if we need to use

00:17:34.606 --> 00:17:36.566 A:middle
the proxy, go ahead and connect

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:38.516 A:middle
to it, create a TCP connection

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:38.716 A:middle
there.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.456 A:middle
But if we don't need it, we'll

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:44.256 A:middle
do DNS on your behalf going

00:17:44.256 --> 00:17:46.446 A:middle
directly, get back all of the

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:48.946 A:middle
DNS IP address answers, and

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:51.676 A:middle
connect to them one after the

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:52.976 A:middle
other, leaving them going in

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:53.436 A:middle
parallel.

00:17:53.436 --> 00:17:54.966 A:middle
We're racing them to get you the

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.366 A:middle
fastest connection possible.

00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:00.616 A:middle
And then, if something goes
