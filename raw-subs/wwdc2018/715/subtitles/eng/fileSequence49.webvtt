00:48:57.126 --> 00:49:00.596 A:middle
this demonstration to not lower

00:49:00.596 --> 00:49:01.546 A:middle
the quality when we hit

00:49:01.576 --> 00:49:03.106 A:middle
contention or when we couldn't

00:49:03.146 --> 00:49:04.786 A:middle
send packets fast enough or to

00:49:04.786 --> 00:49:06.526 A:middle
not drop anything but just to

00:49:06.526 --> 00:49:07.676 A:middle
slow down if we had to.

00:49:08.236 --> 00:49:09.116 A:middle
Now this is probably not what

00:49:09.116 --> 00:49:10.226 A:middle
your app would do in real life,

00:49:10.226 --> 00:49:11.906 A:middle
but it highlights exactly the

00:49:11.906 --> 00:49:13.916 A:middle
difference in the performance

00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:15.536 A:middle
between these two stacks.

00:49:16.156 --> 00:49:16.936 A:middle
So let's see it right now.

00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:23.176 A:middle
So there's exactly the same

00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:25.466 A:middle
data, exactly the same frames

00:49:25.466 --> 00:49:26.666 A:middle
being sent over as fast as they

00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:28.656 A:middle
possibly can, across this

00:49:28.656 --> 00:49:32.446 A:middle
network, and we see the one on

00:49:32.446 --> 00:49:33.836 A:middle
the right is pretty easily

00:49:33.836 --> 00:49:35.176 A:middle
outstripping the one on the

00:49:35.516 --> 00:49:35.646 A:middle
left.

00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:38.436 A:middle
And in fact, if you look at the

00:49:38.436 --> 00:49:40.306 A:middle
difference, it's 30 percent less

00:49:40.306 --> 00:49:41.776 A:middle
overhead that we're viewing on

00:49:41.776 --> 00:49:43.066 A:middle
the receiver side only.

00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:45.616 A:middle
And this is due to the huge

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:47.806 A:middle
difference that we see in the

00:49:47.806 --> 00:49:50.016 A:middle
CPU percentage that it takes to

00:49:50.016 --> 00:49:51.746 A:middle
send and receive UDP packets

00:49:52.336 --> 00:49:53.536 A:middle
when you compare sockets and

00:49:53.536 --> 00:49:54.496 A:middle
user space networking.

00:49:55.186 --> 00:49:56.306 A:middle
Now, of course this is just one

00:49:56.306 --> 00:49:56.746 A:middle
example.

00:49:56.836 --> 00:49:58.396 A:middle
This is not going to be what

00:49:58.586 --> 00:49:59.666 A:middle
every app is going to be like,

00:49:59.666 --> 00:50:00.276 A:middle
because you're going to be
