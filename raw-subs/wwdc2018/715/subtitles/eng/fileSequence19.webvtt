00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:00.896 A:middle
options to control the

00:19:00.896 --> 00:19:02.626 A:middle
interfaces that you use.

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:03.996 A:middle
So if you don't want to use

00:19:03.996 --> 00:19:06.176 A:middle
cellular, simply add cellular to

00:19:06.266 --> 00:19:08.466 A:middle
the list of prohibited interface

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:08.956 A:middle
types.

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:12.316 A:middle
It's even better, actually to

00:19:12.316 --> 00:19:14.436 A:middle
also prohibit expensive networks

00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:16.076 A:middle
in general because this will

00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:18.526 A:middle
also block the usage of personal

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:22.766 A:middle
hotspots on a Mac let's say.

00:19:23.016 --> 00:19:23.736 A:middle
Another way that you can

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:25.066 A:middle
restrict your connection

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.926 A:middle
establishment is by choosing

00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:28.406 A:middle
specifically the IP address

00:19:28.406 --> 00:19:29.816 A:middle
family that you want to use.

00:19:30.466 --> 00:19:31.596 A:middle
So let's say that you really

00:19:31.596 --> 00:19:33.376 A:middle
love IPv6 because it's faster

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:34.146 A:middle
and it's the future.

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:35.646 A:middle
You don't want to use IPv4 at

00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:36.676 A:middle
all on your connection.

00:19:37.346 --> 00:19:39.016 A:middle
And you can do this by going to

00:19:39.016 --> 00:19:40.796 A:middle
your parameters, digging down

00:19:40.796 --> 00:19:42.466 A:middle
into the IP-specific options,

00:19:42.896 --> 00:19:44.286 A:middle
and here you'll have options

00:19:44.286 --> 00:19:45.806 A:middle
that you'll find familiar from

00:19:45.806 --> 00:19:47.846 A:middle
your socket options on a socket

00:19:47.846 --> 00:19:49.586 A:middle
today, and you can also define

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:51.316 A:middle
specifically which IP version

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.146 A:middle
you want to use.

00:19:52.576 --> 00:19:53.876 A:middle
And this will impact your

00:19:53.876 --> 00:19:55.466 A:middle
connection as well as your DNS

00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:56.046 A:middle
resolution.

00:19:56.566 --> 00:19:59.186 A:middle
And lastly, you may not want to

00:19:59.186 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
use a proxy on your given
