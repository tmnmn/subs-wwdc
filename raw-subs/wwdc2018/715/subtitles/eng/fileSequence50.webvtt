00:49:59.666 --> 00:50:00.276 A:middle
because you're going to be

00:50:00.276 --> 00:50:01.606 A:middle
compressing differently.

00:50:01.606 --> 00:50:02.566 A:middle
You're going to be already

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:03.576 A:middle
trying to make your connections

00:50:03.576 --> 00:50:04.236 A:middle
more efficient.

00:50:05.196 --> 00:50:06.966 A:middle
But if you have an app that's

00:50:06.966 --> 00:50:08.426 A:middle
generating live data, especially

00:50:08.426 --> 00:50:10.336 A:middle
if you're using UDP to send and

00:50:10.336 --> 00:50:11.896 A:middle
receive a lot of packets, I

00:50:11.956 --> 00:50:13.706 A:middle
invite you to try using

00:50:13.706 --> 00:50:15.026 A:middle
Network.framework within your

00:50:15.026 --> 00:50:16.466 A:middle
app and run it through

00:50:16.466 --> 00:50:17.086 A:middle
instruments.

00:50:17.636 --> 00:50:19.096 A:middle
Measure the difference in CPU

00:50:19.096 --> 00:50:21.026 A:middle
usage that you have when you're

00:50:21.026 --> 00:50:22.256 A:middle
using Network.framework versus

00:50:22.256 --> 00:50:23.746 A:middle
sockets, and I think you'll be

00:50:23.746 --> 00:50:24.796 A:middle
really happy with what you see.

00:50:30.336 --> 00:50:31.986 A:middle
So the last topic we want to

00:50:31.986 --> 00:50:34.156 A:middle
talk about today is how we can

00:50:34.226 --> 00:50:35.416 A:middle
solve the problems around

00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:37.256 A:middle
network mobility, and this is a

00:50:37.256 --> 00:50:38.606 A:middle
key area that we're trying to

00:50:38.606 --> 00:50:41.416 A:middle
solve with Network.framework.

00:50:42.166 --> 00:50:45.566 A:middle
And the first step of this is

00:50:45.566 --> 00:50:46.816 A:middle
just making sure that we start

00:50:46.816 --> 00:50:47.786 A:middle
connections gracefully.

00:50:48.816 --> 00:50:49.746 A:middle
So we already mentioned this,

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:50.686 A:middle
but I want to recap a little

00:50:50.686 --> 00:50:50.906 A:middle
bit.

00:50:51.836 --> 00:50:54.146 A:middle
The waiting state is the key

00:50:54.206 --> 00:50:55.776 A:middle
thing to handle network

00:50:55.776 --> 00:50:58.326 A:middle
transitions when your connection

00:50:58.326 --> 00:50:59.126 A:middle
is first coming up.

00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:00.836 A:middle
It will indicate that there's a
