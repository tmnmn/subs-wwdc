00:55:59.346 --> 00:56:01.756 A:middle
Multipath TCP because whenever

00:56:01.756 --> 00:56:02.856 A:middle
we change a network, we'll

00:56:02.856 --> 00:56:05.136 A:middle
automatically move for you, your

00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:06.686 A:middle
connection is only not viable

00:56:06.686 --> 00:56:07.966 A:middle
when you have no network

00:56:07.966 --> 00:56:13.176 A:middle
available to you at all.

00:56:13.396 --> 00:56:15.856 A:middle
So between waiting for

00:56:15.856 --> 00:56:19.056 A:middle
connectivity, viability, better

00:56:19.566 --> 00:56:21.956 A:middle
path, MPTCP, we really hope that

00:56:22.026 --> 00:56:23.356 A:middle
all of the use cases in your

00:56:23.356 --> 00:56:25.996 A:middle
apps for using tools like SC

00:56:25.996 --> 00:56:27.836 A:middle
Network Reachability to check

00:56:28.196 --> 00:56:30.096 A:middle
network changes manually have

00:56:30.136 --> 00:56:30.886 A:middle
been replaced.

00:56:31.626 --> 00:56:33.606 A:middle
However, we do recognize that

00:56:33.606 --> 00:56:35.386 A:middle
there are some scenarios in

00:56:35.386 --> 00:56:36.656 A:middle
which you still want to know

00:56:37.156 --> 00:56:38.266 A:middle
what's the available network,

00:56:38.366 --> 00:56:39.406 A:middle
when does it change.

00:56:40.796 --> 00:56:42.146 A:middle
For that Network.framework

00:56:42.206 --> 00:56:44.766 A:middle
offers a new API called the

00:56:44.766 --> 00:56:46.346 A:middle
NWPathMonitor.

00:56:47.776 --> 00:56:50.136 A:middle
So the Path Monitor instead of

00:56:50.136 --> 00:56:51.676 A:middle
watching the reachability and

00:56:51.676 --> 00:56:52.396 A:middle
trying to predict the

00:56:52.396 --> 00:56:53.996 A:middle
reachability of a given host

00:56:54.506 --> 00:56:55.786 A:middle
simply lets you know what is the

00:56:55.786 --> 00:56:57.326 A:middle
current state of the interfaces

00:56:57.746 --> 00:56:59.226 A:middle
on your device and when do they

00:56:59.226 --> 00:56:59.766 A:middle
change.
