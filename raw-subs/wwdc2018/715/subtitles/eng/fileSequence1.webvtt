00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:00.026 A:middle
can do with sockets.

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.496 A:middle
We'll talk about how this API

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.135 A:middle
can help you handle some complex

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:05.726 A:middle
mobility challenges, and we'll

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:07.146 A:middle
wrap up with information on how

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:08.356 A:middle
you can get involved and start

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:08.846 A:middle
adopting.

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:11.906 A:middle
First, I'd like to spend a

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:13.306 A:middle
little bit of time talking about

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:15.096 A:middle
modernizing transport APIs.

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:16.916 A:middle
Now when I say transport API,

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:19.136 A:middle
I'm talking about any API that

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.336 A:middle
lets you send and receive

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:21.996 A:middle
arbitrary data between two

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:23.266 A:middle
endpoints on a network, and

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
that's a pretty broad

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:25.686 A:middle
definition, and there are a lot

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.366 A:middle
of APIs that could fall under

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.036 A:middle
this category.

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.046 A:middle
Perhaps the most ubiquitous is

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:32.706 A:middle
sockets.

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.006 A:middle
Sockets has been within us for

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.066 A:middle
over 30 years, and I don't think

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.306 A:middle
it's an exaggeration to say that

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.696 A:middle
sockets has changed the world,

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:40.606 A:middle
but the world has kept changing.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.046 A:middle
And as a consequence, using

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:44.346 A:middle
sockets to write apps for

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:46.636 A:middle
today's internet is really hard.

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:49.446 A:middle
There are three primary areas in

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.816 A:middle
which it's very difficult to use

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:51.526 A:middle
sockets well.

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.496 A:middle
The first one is Connection

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:55.156 A:middle
Establishment.

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:57.296 A:middle
There's a whole host of reasons

00:01:57.626 --> 00:01:58.916 A:middle
that establishing connections

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:00.266 A:middle
can be really difficult with
