00:40:58.636 --> 00:41:00.656 A:middle
generated by this content will

00:41:00.656 --> 00:41:02.026 A:middle
have all the flags that you

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:02.746 A:middle
wanted marked.

00:41:03.306 --> 00:41:04.126 A:middle
So it's really easy.

00:41:05.256 --> 00:41:07.146 A:middle
And you can also get these same

00:41:07.146 --> 00:41:08.526 A:middle
flags whenever you're receiving

00:41:08.956 --> 00:41:09.586 A:middle
on a connection.

00:41:09.586 --> 00:41:10.716 A:middle
You'll have the same context

00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:11.836 A:middle
object associated with your

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.546 A:middle
receives, and you'll be able to

00:41:13.546 --> 00:41:15.426 A:middle
read out the specific low-level

00:41:15.496 --> 00:41:19.066 A:middle
flags that you want to get out.

00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:21.576 A:middle
Similar, we have service class.

00:41:22.426 --> 00:41:24.906 A:middle
This is a property that is

00:41:24.906 --> 00:41:26.956 A:middle
available also in URLSession

00:41:27.286 --> 00:41:28.476 A:middle
that defines the relative

00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:31.676 A:middle
priority of your traffic, and

00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:33.646 A:middle
this affects the way that

00:41:33.646 --> 00:41:34.956 A:middle
traffic is queued on the local

00:41:34.956 --> 00:41:36.886 A:middle
interfaces when we're sending as

00:41:36.886 --> 00:41:38.416 A:middle
well as how the traffic works on

00:41:38.416 --> 00:41:39.776 A:middle
Cisco Fastlane networks.

00:41:39.776 --> 00:41:43.216 A:middle
So you can mark your service

00:41:43.216 --> 00:41:44.916 A:middle
class as a property on your

00:41:44.916 --> 00:41:47.166 A:middle
entire connection by using the

00:41:47.166 --> 00:41:49.466 A:middle
service class parameter in your

00:41:49.466 --> 00:41:50.526 A:middle
parameter's object.

00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:53.516 A:middle
In this case, we show how to use

00:41:53.916 --> 00:41:55.256 A:middle
the background service class,

00:41:55.606 --> 00:41:57.196 A:middle
and this is a great way to mark

00:41:57.246 --> 00:41:58.936 A:middle
that your connection is

00:41:58.936 --> 00:41:59.976 A:middle
relatively low priority.
