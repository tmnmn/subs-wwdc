00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:00.616 A:middle
And then, if something goes

00:18:00.616 --> 00:18:01.926 A:middle
wrong with WiFi, let's say the

00:18:01.926 --> 00:18:03.806 A:middle
WiFi radio quality goes really

00:18:03.806 --> 00:18:05.006 A:middle
bad because you're walking away

00:18:05.006 --> 00:18:07.546 A:middle
from the building, we can

00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:09.136 A:middle
actually take advantage of the

00:18:09.136 --> 00:18:11.156 A:middle
feature called WiFi assist and

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.156 A:middle
fall back seamlessly to the

00:18:13.156 --> 00:18:15.366 A:middle
cellular network, do DNS

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:17.836 A:middle
resolution there, and try the

00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:18.906 A:middle
connections one after the other.

00:18:19.146 --> 00:18:22.146 A:middle
So this way your connection

00:18:22.146 --> 00:18:24.396 A:middle
establishment is very resilient,

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.926 A:middle
handles VPNs, handles proxies

00:18:26.926 --> 00:18:29.066 A:middle
for you, and gets you the best

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:29.816 A:middle
connection possible.

00:18:29.816 --> 00:18:34.026 A:middle
Now, of course, you may not want

00:18:34.116 --> 00:18:35.606 A:middle
to try all of these options.

00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:37.216 A:middle
You may want to restrict what

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.176 A:middle
the connection establishment

00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:40.646 A:middle
does, and so we have many

00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:42.256 A:middle
different knobs and controls to

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:43.346 A:middle
let you do that, and I want to

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.756 A:middle
highlight just three of them

00:18:45.296 --> 00:18:45.416 A:middle
today.

00:18:46.616 --> 00:18:48.986 A:middle
The first is you may not want to

00:18:48.986 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
use expensive networks, like a

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:52.376 A:middle
cellular network, because this

00:18:52.376 --> 00:18:54.106 A:middle
connection is only appropriate

00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:55.226 A:middle
to use over WiFi.

00:18:56.086 --> 00:18:57.586 A:middle
So within the parameters for

00:18:57.586 --> 00:18:59.396 A:middle
your connection, there are

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:00.896 A:middle
options to control the
