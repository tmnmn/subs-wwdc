00:46:01.756 --> 00:46:03.376 A:middle
The next area I want to talk

00:46:03.376 --> 00:46:04.516 A:middle
about for performance is

00:46:04.516 --> 00:46:05.486 A:middle
something that you don't

00:46:05.536 --> 00:46:06.896 A:middle
actually need to do anything in

00:46:06.896 --> 00:46:07.676 A:middle
your app to get.

00:46:08.206 --> 00:46:09.266 A:middle
This is something that you get

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:11.176 A:middle
totally for free whenever you

00:46:11.656 --> 00:46:13.226 A:middle
use URLSession or

00:46:13.226 --> 00:46:14.486 A:middle
Network.framework connections,

00:46:14.846 --> 00:46:16.446 A:middle
and this is user-space

00:46:16.506 --> 00:46:17.006 A:middle
networking.

00:46:17.726 --> 00:46:18.626 A:middle
So this is something that we

00:46:18.626 --> 00:46:20.456 A:middle
introduced last year here at

00:46:20.456 --> 00:46:23.986 A:middle
WWDC, and it's enabled on iOS

00:46:23.986 --> 00:46:24.646 A:middle
and tvOS.

00:46:24.886 --> 00:46:27.446 A:middle
This is where we're avoiding the

00:46:27.446 --> 00:46:28.966 A:middle
socket layer entirely, and we've

00:46:28.966 --> 00:46:31.196 A:middle
moved the transport stack into

00:46:31.196 --> 00:46:32.396 A:middle
your app.

00:46:32.546 --> 00:46:33.656 A:middle
So to give you an idea of what

00:46:33.656 --> 00:46:35.646 A:middle
this is doing, I want to start

00:46:35.646 --> 00:46:37.136 A:middle
with what the legacy model of

00:46:37.136 --> 00:46:39.166 A:middle
the stack generally is.

00:46:39.876 --> 00:46:40.836 A:middle
So let's say that you're

00:46:40.836 --> 00:46:42.226 A:middle
receiving a packet off the

00:46:42.226 --> 00:46:42.546 A:middle
network.

00:46:42.896 --> 00:46:44.226 A:middle
It's the WiFi interface.

00:46:44.906 --> 00:46:45.896 A:middle
That packet will come into the

00:46:45.896 --> 00:46:48.806 A:middle
driver, will be sent into the

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:50.926 A:middle
TCP receive buffer within the

00:46:50.926 --> 00:46:53.546 A:middle
kernel, and then when your

00:46:53.546 --> 00:46:55.476 A:middle
application reads on a socket,

00:46:56.206 --> 00:46:57.196 A:middle
that's going to do a context

00:46:57.196 --> 00:46:59.106 A:middle
switch and copy the data up from

00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:01.636 A:middle
the kernel into your app, and
