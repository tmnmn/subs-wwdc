00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:00.706 A:middle
raw bytes from the camera, ship

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:01.866 A:middle
them across the network, and

00:23:01.866 --> 00:23:02.936 A:middle
display them on the other side.

00:23:03.456 --> 00:23:05.966 A:middle
In order to make this happen, we

00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:07.206 A:middle
need to divvy those frames up

00:23:07.206 --> 00:23:09.006 A:middle
into smaller chunks that we can

00:23:09.006 --> 00:23:10.416 A:middle
send in UDP packets.

00:23:11.986 --> 00:23:13.236 A:middle
Of course, to send those UDP

00:23:13.236 --> 00:23:14.876 A:middle
packets on the network, we need

00:23:15.766 --> 00:23:16.926 A:middle
a connection.

00:23:16.926 --> 00:23:17.846 A:middle
Switching over to the other

00:23:17.846 --> 00:23:19.906 A:middle
device, we need a listener that

00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:21.036 A:middle
can receive that incoming

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:23.196 A:middle
connection and read the data

00:23:23.196 --> 00:23:24.366 A:middle
packets off the network.

00:23:25.156 --> 00:23:26.326 A:middle
From there, we simply reverse

00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:27.336 A:middle
the earlier process,

00:23:27.796 --> 00:23:29.056 A:middle
reassembling the video frames

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:30.756 A:middle
and sending them to the display

00:23:30.756 --> 00:23:31.666 A:middle
so that we can see them on the

00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:31.966 A:middle
screen.

00:23:32.556 --> 00:23:35.536 A:middle
To keep things simple, we've

00:23:35.536 --> 00:23:36.766 A:middle
already abstracted out the

00:23:36.766 --> 00:23:37.846 A:middle
camera and the display

00:23:37.846 --> 00:23:39.346 A:middle
functionalities so that we can

00:23:39.346 --> 00:23:41.156 A:middle
focus just on the parts that use

00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:41.806 A:middle
Network.framework.

00:23:43.296 --> 00:23:44.856 A:middle
There's one piece we haven't yet

00:23:44.856 --> 00:23:46.086 A:middle
covered here, and that's the

00:23:46.086 --> 00:23:46.496 A:middle
listener.

00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:47.646 A:middle
So we're going to take a minute

00:23:47.646 --> 00:23:50.076 A:middle
to do that now.

00:23:50.326 --> 00:23:51.726 A:middle
Listener functionality is

00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:53.116 A:middle
provided by the NWListener

00:23:53.116 --> 00:23:54.976 A:middle
class, which you can create

00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:56.026 A:middle
using the same parameters

00:23:56.026 --> 00:23:57.386 A:middle
objects that you used to

00:23:57.386 --> 00:23:58.206 A:middle
configure connections.

00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:01.296 A:middle
It's really easy to set up a
