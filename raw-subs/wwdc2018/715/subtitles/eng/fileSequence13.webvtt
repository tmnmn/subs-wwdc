00:12:59.116 --> 00:13:00.286 A:middle
You have an endpoint, which

00:13:00.286 --> 00:13:01.676 A:middle
defines the destination you want

00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:03.636 A:middle
to get to, and this could be the

00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:05.186 A:middle
address, the IP address that you

00:13:05.186 --> 00:13:07.566 A:middle
had before, but usually, like in

00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:09.126 A:middle
this example, we have a host

00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:10.846 A:middle
name and a port, and so our end

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:12.486 A:middle
point can just be that host name

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:12.916 A:middle
and port.

00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:14.756 A:middle
It could also be a bonjour

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:15.856 A:middle
service that I want to connect

00:13:15.856 --> 00:13:16.016 A:middle
to.

00:13:17.486 --> 00:13:19.276 A:middle
And then I also have parameters.

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:21.286 A:middle
Parameters define what protocols

00:13:21.286 --> 00:13:24.206 A:middle
I want to use, TLS, DTLS, UDP,

00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:24.536 A:middle
TCP.

00:13:24.536 --> 00:13:27.176 A:middle
It defines the protocol options

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:29.456 A:middle
that I want as well as which

00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:31.016 A:middle
paths I want to use to connect

00:13:31.016 --> 00:13:31.336 A:middle
over.

00:13:31.726 --> 00:13:32.586 A:middle
Do I want to just connect over

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:34.606 A:middle
anything, or do I only want to

00:13:35.276 --> 00:13:36.136 A:middle
use WiFi?

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.816 A:middle
Once you've configured your

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.616 A:middle
connection, you simply call

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:41.786 A:middle
start to get things going, and

00:13:41.786 --> 00:13:42.876 A:middle
then you wait for the connection

00:13:42.876 --> 00:13:44.196 A:middle
to move into the ready state.

00:13:44.786 --> 00:13:45.956 A:middle
And that's all you need to do to

00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:47.376 A:middle
bring up a full TLS connection

00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:47.906 A:middle
to your server.

00:13:48.936 --> 00:13:49.746 A:middle
And I think you're going to love

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.746 A:middle
how this looks in Swift.

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:53.536 A:middle
So here's what you do.

00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:55.636 A:middle
You first import the network

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:56.126 A:middle
module.

00:13:57.496 --> 00:13:59.956 A:middle
Then, you create an NWConnection

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:00.406 A:middle
object.
