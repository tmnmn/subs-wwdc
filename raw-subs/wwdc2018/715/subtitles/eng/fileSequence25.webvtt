00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:01.316 A:middle
UDPClient class and the

00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:02.076 A:middle
UDPServer class.

00:25:03.156 --> 00:25:05.016 A:middle
The UDPClient is going to be

00:25:05.016 --> 00:25:06.306 A:middle
responsible for creating the

00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:07.966 A:middle
connection to the other side and

00:25:07.966 --> 00:25:09.026 A:middle
sending the frames across.

00:25:10.286 --> 00:25:11.776 A:middle
Likewise, the server is

00:25:11.776 --> 00:25:12.816 A:middle
responsible for creating the

00:25:12.816 --> 00:25:14.736 A:middle
listener, accepting incoming

00:25:14.736 --> 00:25:16.446 A:middle
connections, reading the data

00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:17.746 A:middle
off those connections, and

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:18.756 A:middle
sending them up to the screen.

00:25:19.736 --> 00:25:22.416 A:middle
Let's start with the client.

00:25:22.526 --> 00:25:23.656 A:middle
My client class has an

00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:25.656 A:middle
initializer that takes a name,

00:25:25.996 --> 00:25:28.056 A:middle
which is a string describing the

00:25:28.056 --> 00:25:29.766 A:middle
bonjour name that we want to

00:25:30.316 --> 00:25:31.436 A:middle
connect to.

00:25:31.646 --> 00:25:33.836 A:middle
I'll create my connection by

00:25:33.836 --> 00:25:35.986 A:middle
simply calling NWConnection and

00:25:35.986 --> 00:25:37.296 A:middle
passing in a service endpoint.

00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:39.116 A:middle
Using the name that I was

00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:42.826 A:middle
provided and camera.udp as the

00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:43.556 A:middle
type.

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:45.336 A:middle
We also passed the default UDP

00:25:45.336 --> 00:25:45.876 A:middle
parameters.

00:25:46.386 --> 00:25:49.596 A:middle
As Tommy mentioned, we can use a

00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:52.826 A:middle
state update handler to check

00:25:53.226 --> 00:25:54.546 A:middle
for the ready and the failed

00:25:54.546 --> 00:25:55.016 A:middle
states.

00:25:56.066 --> 00:25:57.546 A:middle
Here, when our connection is

00:25:57.546 --> 00:25:58.776 A:middle
ready, we'll call

00:25:58.776 --> 00:26:00.676 A:middle
sendInitialFrame, which we'll
