00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:01.616 A:middle
So I want to dig into what

00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:03.166 A:middle
happens when you call start.

00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:04.216 A:middle
What's actually going on?

00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:06.326 A:middle
So here's a little state

00:16:06.326 --> 00:16:08.356 A:middle
machine, the innards of the

00:16:08.356 --> 00:16:09.016 A:middle
NWConnection.

00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:10.976 A:middle
When we begin at the setup state

00:16:10.976 --> 00:16:13.686 A:middle
and we call start, we move into

00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:15.146 A:middle
the preparing state.

00:16:16.416 --> 00:16:19.116 A:middle
So the preparing state does a

00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:20.566 A:middle
lot more than just calling

00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:22.626 A:middle
connect on a TCP socket.

00:16:23.696 --> 00:16:25.516 A:middle
For TCP socket, that would just

00:16:25.516 --> 00:16:27.896 A:middle
send out a SYN packet across to

00:16:27.896 --> 00:16:29.066 A:middle
the server that you're trying to

00:16:29.066 --> 00:16:29.456 A:middle
reach.

00:16:30.876 --> 00:16:32.356 A:middle
But when you call start on an

00:16:32.356 --> 00:16:33.456 A:middle
NWConnection, it actually

00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:34.766 A:middle
handles all of the things that

00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:36.226 A:middle
Josh was mentioning earlier.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:38.786 A:middle
It evaluates the network you're

00:16:38.786 --> 00:16:41.106 A:middle
on and tries to make the fastest

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:42.296 A:middle
connection possible for you.

00:16:42.296 --> 00:16:44.086 A:middle
I want to dig into that a little

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:44.446 A:middle
bit more.

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:46.896 A:middle
So this is what we call Smart

00:16:47.146 --> 00:16:48.296 A:middle
Connection Establishment.

00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:51.286 A:middle
So the very first thing that we

00:16:51.286 --> 00:16:54.086 A:middle
do when you call start is that

00:16:54.086 --> 00:16:56.056 A:middle
we take your endpoint, and then

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.396 A:middle
we evaluate what are all the

00:16:57.396 --> 00:16:58.306 A:middle
networks that are currently

00:16:58.306 --> 00:16:58.966 A:middle
available to me.

00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:01.866 A:middle
In this case, we have WiFi and
