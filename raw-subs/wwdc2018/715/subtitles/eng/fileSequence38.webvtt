00:38:00.576 --> 00:38:01.486 A:middle
And so you want to read that

00:38:01.486 --> 00:38:03.036 A:middle
header first and then read the

00:38:03.036 --> 00:38:04.646 A:middle
rest of your content, and maybe

00:38:04.646 --> 00:38:05.686 A:middle
your content's quite long.

00:38:05.686 --> 00:38:07.506 A:middle
It's a couple megabytes let's

00:38:07.506 --> 00:38:07.726 A:middle
say.

00:38:09.066 --> 00:38:10.536 A:middle
Traditionally with a socket, you

00:38:10.536 --> 00:38:11.886 A:middle
may try to read 10 bytes.

00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:13.776 A:middle
You may get 10 bytes, you may

00:38:13.776 --> 00:38:14.336 A:middle
get less.

00:38:14.476 --> 00:38:15.426 A:middle
You have to keep reading until

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:16.836 A:middle
you get exactly 10 bytes to read

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:17.206 A:middle
your header.

00:38:18.096 --> 00:38:19.046 A:middle
And then you have to read a

00:38:19.206 --> 00:38:21.016 A:middle
couple megabytes, and you'll

00:38:21.016 --> 00:38:21.976 A:middle
read some, and you'll get a

00:38:21.976 --> 00:38:22.836 A:middle
whole bunch of different read

00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:24.076 A:middle
calls and essentially go back

00:38:24.076 --> 00:38:25.836 A:middle
and forth between your app and

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:26.736 A:middle
the stack.

00:38:28.696 --> 00:38:30.686 A:middle
With an NWConnection, when you

00:38:30.686 --> 00:38:33.686 A:middle
call receive, you provide the

00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:35.316 A:middle
minimum data that you want to

00:38:35.316 --> 00:38:36.806 A:middle
receive and the maximum data.

00:38:37.676 --> 00:38:38.996 A:middle
So you could actually specify if

00:38:38.996 --> 00:38:40.426 A:middle
you want to receive exactly 10

00:38:40.426 --> 00:38:41.326 A:middle
bytes because that's your

00:38:41.326 --> 00:38:43.256 A:middle
protocol, you can just say, I

00:38:43.256 --> 00:38:44.646 A:middle
want a minimum of 10 and a

00:38:44.646 --> 00:38:45.406 A:middle
maximum of 10.

00:38:45.506 --> 00:38:46.736 A:middle
Give me exactly 10 bytes.

00:38:47.236 --> 00:38:48.646 A:middle
And we will only call you back

00:38:49.246 --> 00:38:50.686 A:middle
when either there was an error

00:38:50.946 --> 00:38:51.856 A:middle
in reading on the connection

00:38:51.856 --> 00:38:54.276 A:middle
overall or we read exactly those

00:38:54.276 --> 00:38:54.946 A:middle
10 bytes.

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.806 A:middle
Then you can easily just read

00:38:57.806 --> 00:38:59.126 A:middle
out whatever content you need

00:38:59.126 --> 00:39:00.156 A:middle
for your header, read out the
