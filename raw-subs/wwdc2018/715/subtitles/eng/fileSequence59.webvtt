00:58:59.126 --> 00:59:01.496 A:middle
CFStreamCreatePairWith, anything

00:59:01.496 --> 00:59:03.276 A:middle
related to sockets as well as

00:59:03.276 --> 00:59:03.796 A:middle
CFSocket.

00:59:04.606 --> 00:59:06.146 A:middle
These cannot take advantage of a

00:59:06.146 --> 00:59:07.296 A:middle
lot of the connection

00:59:07.296 --> 00:59:08.316 A:middle
establishment that we've put in

00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:09.486 A:middle
there with the new

00:59:09.486 --> 00:59:10.766 A:middle
Network.framework, and they

00:59:10.766 --> 00:59:11.776 A:middle
can't take advantage of the new

00:59:11.776 --> 00:59:12.886 A:middle
User Space Networking.

00:59:12.996 --> 00:59:14.006 A:middle
So we really want you to move

00:59:14.006 --> 00:59:15.266 A:middle
off of these to take advantage

00:59:15.546 --> 00:59:17.356 A:middle
of the incredibly robust

00:59:17.356 --> 00:59:18.556 A:middle
connectivity improvements that

00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:19.376 A:middle
you'll get with

00:59:19.376 --> 00:59:21.046 A:middle
Network.framework and URLSession

00:59:21.536 --> 00:59:22.776 A:middle
and the improved performance.

00:59:23.936 --> 00:59:25.656 A:middle
There are some foundation APIs

00:59:25.656 --> 00:59:26.566 A:middle
as well that we'd like you to

00:59:26.566 --> 00:59:27.246 A:middle
move away from.

00:59:27.526 --> 00:59:29.106 A:middle
If you're using any of these

00:59:29.196 --> 00:59:31.856 A:middle
NSStream, NSNetService, or

00:59:31.906 --> 00:59:34.076 A:middle
NSSocket for APIs, please move

00:59:34.076 --> 00:59:35.656 A:middle
to Network.framework or

00:59:35.886 --> 00:59:36.606 A:middle
URLSession.

00:59:37.576 --> 00:59:38.476 A:middle
Finally, if you're using

00:59:38.556 --> 00:59:40.906 A:middle
SCNetworkReachability, we feel

00:59:40.906 --> 00:59:41.996 A:middle
that the Wait for Connectivity

00:59:41.996 --> 00:59:43.836 A:middle
model is a much better model, so

00:59:43.836 --> 00:59:45.196 A:middle
we'd really like you to move to

00:59:45.196 --> 00:59:45.406 A:middle
that.

00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.166 A:middle
And for those few cases where

00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:48.526 A:middle
Wait for Connectivity isn't the

00:59:48.526 --> 00:59:50.576 A:middle
right answer, NWPathMonitor is a

00:59:50.576 --> 00:59:51.776 A:middle
much better solution going

00:59:51.776 --> 00:59:52.146 A:middle
forward.

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:54.216 A:middle
So now that we've talked about

00:59:54.216 --> 00:59:55.016 A:middle
some things we'd like you to

00:59:55.016 --> 00:59:56.216 A:middle
stop doing, I want to focus on

00:59:56.216 --> 00:59:57.216 A:middle
the things we really want to see

00:59:57.216 --> 00:59:57.516 A:middle
you do.

00:59:58.736 --> 01:00:00.056 A:middle
Going forward, the preferred
