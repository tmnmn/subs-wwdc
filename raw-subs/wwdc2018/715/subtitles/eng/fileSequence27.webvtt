00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:00.126 A:middle
incoming data off of the

00:27:00.126 --> 00:27:00.576 A:middle
connection.

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:03.006 A:middle
In that completion handler, we

00:27:03.006 --> 00:27:04.106 A:middle
validate that the content is

00:27:04.106 --> 00:27:06.216 A:middle
present, and if so, we let the

00:27:06.216 --> 00:27:07.386 A:middle
rest of the application know

00:27:07.386 --> 00:27:08.836 A:middle
that we're connected, and it

00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:09.776 A:middle
should bring up the camera

00:27:09.776 --> 00:27:11.156 A:middle
hardware and start generating

00:27:11.156 --> 00:27:11.476 A:middle
frames.

00:27:12.076 --> 00:27:15.186 A:middle
When those frames are generated,

00:27:15.616 --> 00:27:16.566 A:middle
the rest of the application

00:27:16.566 --> 00:27:18.266 A:middle
knows to call send on our

00:27:18.266 --> 00:27:22.986 A:middle
UDPClient class and pass it an

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:24.676 A:middle
array of data objects

00:27:24.796 --> 00:27:26.056 A:middle
representing the video frames

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:28.906 A:middle
that we're trying to send.

00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:30.006 A:middle
Because we're going to be doing

00:27:30.006 --> 00:27:31.406 A:middle
a lot of send operations in very

00:27:31.406 --> 00:27:32.876 A:middle
quick succession, we're going to

00:27:32.876 --> 00:27:34.516 A:middle
do them within a block that we

00:27:34.516 --> 00:27:37.436 A:middle
passed in connection.batch.

00:27:37.646 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
Within this block we're going to

00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:41.026 A:middle
go through every frame in that

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:43.206 A:middle
array of data objects and pass

00:27:43.206 --> 00:27:45.226 A:middle
each one to connection.send.

00:27:45.926 --> 00:27:47.826 A:middle
Similarly to above, we use the

00:27:47.826 --> 00:27:48.976 A:middle
completion handler to check for

00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:50.466 A:middle
any errors that were encountered

00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:50.916 A:middle
while sending.

00:27:52.056 --> 00:27:52.526 A:middle
And that's it.

00:27:53.216 --> 00:27:54.546 A:middle
We've got our UDPClient class,

00:27:54.826 --> 00:27:55.556 A:middle
and we're ready to go.

00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:58.566 A:middle
Let's look at the server.

00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:01.416 A:middle
On the server side, we need a
