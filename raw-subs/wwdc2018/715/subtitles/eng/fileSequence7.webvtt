00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:01.256 A:middle
things people love about sockets

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:02.446 A:middle
is that it gives them very

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:03.976 A:middle
fine-grain control over just

00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:05.456 A:middle
about everything, and they're

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:06.926 A:middle
really loathe to give that up.

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.156 A:middle
So as we developed

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:09.386 A:middle
Network.framework, we wanted to

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:10.866 A:middle
make sure that it did the right

00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:12.536 A:middle
thing by default in the way that

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.296 A:middle
sockets doesn't, but it gave you

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:16.186 A:middle
all the knobs that sockets does.

00:07:16.506 --> 00:07:17.236 A:middle
And it's kind of got this

00:07:17.276 --> 00:07:19.936 A:middle
gradient, so the more knobs you

00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:20.976 A:middle
turn, the more complex it

00:07:21.016 --> 00:07:21.546 A:middle
becomes.

00:07:22.016 --> 00:07:23.266 A:middle
It gives you all the power you

00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:24.836 A:middle
need, but you don't have to pay

00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:26.146 A:middle
for the complexity unless you

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:29.506 A:middle
actually need some of it.

00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:32.426 A:middle
Network.framework has incredibly

00:07:32.426 --> 00:07:34.016 A:middle
smart connection establishment.

00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:36.936 A:middle
It handles the dual stack cases.

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:38.916 A:middle
It handles IPv6 only networks.

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:39.726 A:middle
It handles PAC.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:40.976 A:middle
It handles proxies.

00:07:41.676 --> 00:07:43.936 A:middle
It will help you connect on

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:45.386 A:middle
networks that are otherwise very

00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:46.206 A:middle
difficult to deal with.

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:48.656 A:middle
It has an incredibly optimized

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:50.706 A:middle
data transfer path that lets you

00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:52.146 A:middle
go way beyond the performance of

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:52.906 A:middle
anything you can do with

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:54.086 A:middle
sockets, and Tommy will cover

00:07:54.086 --> 00:07:54.746 A:middle
that in a little bit.

00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:57.326 A:middle
It has support for built-in

00:07:57.326 --> 00:07:57.856 A:middle
security.

00:07:58.326 --> 00:08:00.796 A:middle
It supports TLS and DTLS by
