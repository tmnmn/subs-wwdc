00:31:58.356 --> 00:32:00.276 A:middle
So here we just saw how quickly

00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:01.386 A:middle
I was able to bring up a

00:32:01.726 --> 00:32:03.806 A:middle
UDPClient that could connect to

00:32:03.806 --> 00:32:06.616 A:middle
a bonjour service, it can send a

00:32:06.616 --> 00:32:08.356 A:middle
handshake, wait for that to be

00:32:08.356 --> 00:32:10.726 A:middle
processed, take the video frames

00:32:10.726 --> 00:32:11.956 A:middle
coming from the camera, and ship

00:32:11.956 --> 00:32:12.806 A:middle
them across the network.

00:32:14.116 --> 00:32:16.716 A:middle
The server side brought up a

00:32:16.716 --> 00:32:18.606 A:middle
bonjour listener.

00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:20.866 A:middle
It advertised a service, it

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:22.196 A:middle
received incoming connections,

00:32:22.436 --> 00:32:23.916 A:middle
responded to the handshake, and

00:32:23.916 --> 00:32:25.516 A:middle
sent them all to the display so

00:32:25.516 --> 00:32:26.106 A:middle
that we could see them.

00:32:27.176 --> 00:32:28.426 A:middle
And now to take you through

00:32:28.666 --> 00:32:29.846 A:middle
optimizing that data transfer in

00:32:29.846 --> 00:32:30.896 A:middle
a little more detail, I'd like

00:32:30.896 --> 00:32:32.126 A:middle
to invite Tommy back up to the

00:32:32.126 --> 00:32:32.506 A:middle
stage.

00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:38.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:39.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Eric.

00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:42.116 A:middle
It was a really cool demo.

00:32:42.116 --> 00:32:43.386 A:middle
It's super easy to get this

00:32:43.386 --> 00:32:44.876 A:middle
going, and so now we've covered

00:32:44.876 --> 00:32:46.406 A:middle
the basics, and we know how to

00:32:46.736 --> 00:32:48.096 A:middle
establish connections outbound,

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:49.106 A:middle
how to receive connections

00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:52.136 A:middle
inbound, but the real key part

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:53.556 A:middle
of Network.framework that's

00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:54.526 A:middle
going to be the killer feature

00:32:54.526 --> 00:32:56.346 A:middle
here is the way that it can

00:32:56.346 --> 00:32:57.846 A:middle
optimize your performance and

00:32:57.846 --> 00:32:58.926 A:middle
that we can go beyond what

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.126 A:middle
sockets was able to do.
