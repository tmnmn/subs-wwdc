00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:02.086 A:middle
in your stack up to TLS, for

00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:02.486 A:middle
example.

00:21:03.476 --> 00:21:04.646 A:middle
At this point, you can read and

00:21:04.646 --> 00:21:07.066 A:middle
write, and this is also where we

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:10.036 A:middle
give you callbacks about the

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:11.476 A:middle
network transitions that you're

00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:12.016 A:middle
going through.

00:21:12.536 --> 00:21:14.086 A:middle
So if your connection is

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.236 A:middle
established and then you change

00:21:15.236 --> 00:21:17.196 A:middle
networks, we'll give you updates

00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:18.426 A:middle
about that so you can handle the

00:21:18.426 --> 00:21:20.416 A:middle
mobility gracefully, and we'll

00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:21.716 A:middle
be talking about this later on

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:21.976 A:middle
in the talk.

00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:25.606 A:middle
If there's an error on the

00:21:25.606 --> 00:21:27.046 A:middle
connection, either during the

00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:28.716 A:middle
connection establishment or

00:21:28.716 --> 00:21:29.916 A:middle
after you've already connected,

00:21:30.076 --> 00:21:31.136 A:middle
we'll give you the failed state

00:21:31.136 --> 00:21:33.546 A:middle
with an error, and then once

00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:34.336 A:middle
you're totally done with the

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.396 A:middle
connection, let's say you

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:36.506 A:middle
already closed it or you

00:21:36.506 --> 00:21:37.696 A:middle
received a close from the other

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:39.606 A:middle
side, and you want to just

00:21:39.606 --> 00:21:40.766 A:middle
invalidate the connection, you

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.716 A:middle
call cancel, and we move into

00:21:42.716 --> 00:21:43.536 A:middle
the cancelled state.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
And this is guaranteed to be the

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:47.156 A:middle
very last event that we will

00:21:47.156 --> 00:21:49.506 A:middle
deliver to your object so you

00:21:49.506 --> 00:21:50.656 A:middle
can clean up any memory that you

00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:52.506 A:middle
have associated and move on.

00:21:53.656 --> 00:21:54.456 A:middle
So that's it.

00:21:54.576 --> 00:21:56.046 A:middle
That's an overview of the basic

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:58.176 A:middle
lifetime of a connection object

00:21:58.176 --> 00:21:59.786 A:middle
in Network.framework, and to

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.306 A:middle
show you how you can use this to
