It supports TLS and DTLS by

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:01.226 A:middle
default.

00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:03.776 A:middle
It's really simple to use.

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:05.616 A:middle
It has great support for

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:06.136 A:middle

00:08:07.926 --> 00:08:08.946 A:middle
network changes that are

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:10.386 A:middle

and tvOS as a CAPI with

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:20.616 A:middle
automatic reference counting, so

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:21.836 A:middle
it's easy to use from Objective

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.646 A:middle
C, and it has an incredible

00:08:23.646 --> 00:08:24.306 A:middle
Swift API.

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:28.166 A:middle
