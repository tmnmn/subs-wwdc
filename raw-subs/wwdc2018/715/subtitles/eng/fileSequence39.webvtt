00:38:59.126 --> 00:39:00.156 A:middle
for your header, read out the

00:39:00.156 --> 00:39:02.126 A:middle
length, and then let's say you

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:04.526 A:middle
want to read a couple megabytes,

00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:05.906 A:middle
and you essentially do the same

00:39:05.906 --> 00:39:08.186 A:middle
thing to read your body, and you

00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:09.546 A:middle
just pass, well I want to read

00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:11.326 A:middle
exactly this amount for my

00:39:11.326 --> 00:39:12.486 A:middle
connection, and this allows you

00:39:12.486 --> 00:39:13.926 A:middle
to not go back and forth between

00:39:13.926 --> 00:39:15.576 A:middle
the stack and your app but just

00:39:15.576 --> 00:39:16.976 A:middle
have a single callback of when

00:39:17.056 --> 00:39:18.516 A:middle
all of your data is ready to go.

00:39:19.616 --> 00:39:21.216 A:middle
So it's a really great way to

00:39:21.256 --> 00:39:22.686 A:middle
optimize the interactions.

00:39:23.366 --> 00:39:25.856 A:middle
Beyond sending and receiving,

00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:27.776 A:middle
there are a couple of advanced

00:39:27.776 --> 00:39:28.696 A:middle
options that I'd like to

00:39:28.696 --> 00:39:30.916 A:middle
highlight in your network

00:39:30.916 --> 00:39:32.316 A:middle
parameters that allow you to

00:39:32.346 --> 00:39:34.216 A:middle
configure your connection to get

00:39:34.616 --> 00:39:37.056 A:middle
very good startup time as well

00:39:37.056 --> 00:39:38.876 A:middle
as behavior on the network when

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:39.656 A:middle
you're actually sending and

00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:40.046 A:middle
receiving.

00:39:41.226 --> 00:39:42.746 A:middle
So the first one is one that

00:39:42.746 --> 00:39:43.986 A:middle
we've talked about many times

00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:46.236 A:middle
here at WWDC, which is ECN.

00:39:46.306 --> 00:39:48.136 A:middle
This is explicit congestion

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:48.836 A:middle
notification.

00:39:50.086 --> 00:39:52.966 A:middle
It gives you a way to smooth out

00:39:52.966 --> 00:39:54.986 A:middle
your connection by having the

00:39:54.986 --> 00:39:57.856 A:middle
network let the end host know

00:39:58.176 --> 00:39:59.226 A:middle
when there's congestion on the

00:39:59.226 --> 00:40:00.796 A:middle
network so we can pace things
