00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:00.836 A:middle
It will indicate that there's a

00:51:00.836 --> 00:51:02.436 A:middle
lack of connectivity or the

00:51:02.476 --> 00:51:04.166 A:middle
connectivity changed while you

00:51:04.166 --> 00:51:05.486 A:middle
were in the middle of doing DNS

00:51:05.636 --> 00:51:06.096 A:middle
or TCP.

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:08.996 A:middle
We really encourage you please

00:51:08.996 --> 00:51:11.106 A:middle
avoid using APIs like

00:51:11.206 --> 00:51:13.426 A:middle
reachability to check the

00:51:13.426 --> 00:51:14.496 A:middle
network state before you

00:51:14.496 --> 00:51:15.466 A:middle
establish your connection.

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:17.306 A:middle
That will lead to race

00:51:17.376 --> 00:51:19.016 A:middle
conditions and may not provide

00:51:19.016 --> 00:51:20.126 A:middle
an accurate picture of what's

00:51:20.126 --> 00:51:21.566 A:middle
actually happening in the

00:51:21.566 --> 00:51:21.996 A:middle
connection.

00:51:22.536 --> 00:51:25.066 A:middle
And if you need to make sure

00:51:25.066 --> 00:51:26.396 A:middle
that your connection does not

00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:27.966 A:middle
establish over a cellular

00:51:27.966 --> 00:51:31.516 A:middle
network, don't check up front is

00:51:31.516 --> 00:51:32.516 A:middle
the device currently on a

00:51:32.516 --> 00:51:33.976 A:middle
cellular network, because that

00:51:33.976 --> 00:51:34.716 A:middle
could change.

00:51:35.486 --> 00:51:36.846 A:middle
Simply restrict the interface

00:51:36.846 --> 00:51:38.716 A:middle
types that you want to use using

00:51:38.716 --> 00:51:40.046 A:middle
the NWParameters.

00:51:41.266 --> 00:51:42.316 A:middle
So once you've started your

00:51:42.316 --> 00:51:44.006 A:middle
connection and you're in the

00:51:44.006 --> 00:51:45.506 A:middle
ready state, there are a series

00:51:45.506 --> 00:51:47.006 A:middle
of events that we will give you

00:51:47.476 --> 00:51:49.176 A:middle
to let you know when the network

00:51:49.176 --> 00:51:49.976 A:middle
has changed.

00:51:51.336 --> 00:51:53.006 A:middle
The first one is called

00:51:53.006 --> 00:51:54.236 A:middle
connection viability.

00:51:55.586 --> 00:51:58.186 A:middle
So viability means that your

00:51:58.186 --> 00:51:59.646 A:middle
connection is able to send and

00:51:59.646 --> 00:52:02.306 A:middle
receive data out the interface
