00:30:58.966 --> 00:31:00.666 A:middle
that we can see it on the

00:31:01.596 --> 00:31:01.756 A:middle
screen.

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.296 A:middle
Finally, if there were no

00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:05.456 A:middle
errors, we call receive again so

00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:06.496 A:middle
that we receive subsequent

00:31:06.496 --> 00:31:08.026 A:middle
frames and send them up to the

00:31:08.026 --> 00:31:09.826 A:middle
display to book together a video

00:31:09.826 --> 00:31:11.156 A:middle
from each of these individual

00:31:11.156 --> 00:31:11.526 A:middle
images.

00:31:12.086 --> 00:31:13.876 A:middle
So that's it.

00:31:13.966 --> 00:31:15.566 A:middle
We've got our UDPClient, we've

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:17.476 A:middle
got our UDPServer, let's try it

00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:17.656 A:middle
out.

00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
I'm going to run the client on

00:31:22.316 --> 00:31:24.046 A:middle
my phone here, and I'm going to

00:31:24.046 --> 00:31:25.786 A:middle
run the server on my Mac so we

00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:26.826 A:middle
can see it on the big screen.

00:31:27.366 --> 00:31:29.626 A:middle
Here, the server just came up,

00:31:30.386 --> 00:31:32.086 A:middle
and we see that it's advertising

00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:34.026 A:middle
as Demo Mac, which is where I

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:36.166 A:middle
told the rest of the system to

00:31:36.166 --> 00:31:37.136 A:middle
just give me the name.

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:39.206 A:middle
That's on my phone.

00:31:39.206 --> 00:31:41.676 A:middle
If I tap connect, all of a

00:31:41.676 --> 00:31:43.826 A:middle
sudden, I can see video frames

00:31:44.276 --> 00:31:45.206 A:middle
being streamed across the

00:31:45.206 --> 00:31:46.796 A:middle
network over UDP Live.

00:31:48.516 --> 00:31:53.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:58.356 --> 00:32:00.276 A:middle
So here we just saw how quickly
