00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:01.646 A:middle
which you connect initially over

00:54:01.646 --> 00:54:02.856 A:middle
the cellular network, and then

00:54:02.856 --> 00:54:04.496 A:middle
the user walks into a building

00:54:04.736 --> 00:54:06.246 A:middle
and now they have WiFi access.

00:54:07.126 --> 00:54:08.356 A:middle
In this case, your connection,

00:54:08.596 --> 00:54:09.706 A:middle
the original one, is totally

00:54:09.706 --> 00:54:10.076 A:middle
fine.

00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:12.106 A:middle
You're still viable, but you now

00:54:12.106 --> 00:54:13.256 A:middle
also have a better path

00:54:13.256 --> 00:54:13.736 A:middle
available.

00:54:14.296 --> 00:54:17.706 A:middle
In this case, again, if you can

00:54:17.706 --> 00:54:19.216 A:middle
migrate your connection, this is

00:54:19.216 --> 00:54:20.826 A:middle
probably a good time to try to

00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:23.046 A:middle
establish a new connection and

00:54:23.046 --> 00:54:23.906 A:middle
move your data over.

00:54:24.536 --> 00:54:26.326 A:middle
That will save the user their

00:54:26.926 --> 00:54:28.316 A:middle
data bill.

00:54:28.526 --> 00:54:30.386 A:middle
But, continue to use the

00:54:30.386 --> 00:54:31.876 A:middle
original connection until you

00:54:31.876 --> 00:54:32.636 A:middle
have the new one fully

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:33.216 A:middle
established.

00:54:34.276 --> 00:54:35.496 A:middle
Just to show how this looks in

00:54:35.496 --> 00:54:37.896 A:middle
code, we have the viability

00:54:37.896 --> 00:54:39.286 A:middle
update handler that you can set

00:54:39.286 --> 00:54:40.366 A:middle
in your connection, we'll give

00:54:40.366 --> 00:54:41.426 A:middle
you a boolean back to let you

00:54:41.426 --> 00:54:42.776 A:middle
know whenever you're viable or

00:54:42.776 --> 00:54:45.866 A:middle
not, and a better path update

00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:47.006 A:middle
handler to let you know when

00:54:47.006 --> 00:54:48.796 A:middle
there's a better path available

00:54:49.176 --> 00:54:49.976 A:middle
or is no longer available.

00:54:53.236 --> 00:54:55.486 A:middle
And now the better solution to

00:54:55.546 --> 00:54:56.806 A:middle
all of this to handle network

00:54:56.836 --> 00:54:58.296 A:middle
mobility is something that we've

00:54:58.296 --> 00:54:59.816 A:middle
talked about in previous years,
