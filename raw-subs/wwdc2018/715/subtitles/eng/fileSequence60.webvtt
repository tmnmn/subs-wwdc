00:59:58.736 --> 01:00:00.056 A:middle
Going forward, the preferred

01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:01.576 A:middle
APIs on our platforms for

01:00:01.576 --> 01:00:03.546 A:middle
networking are URLSession and

01:00:03.546 --> 01:00:04.346 A:middle
Network.framework.

01:00:04.816 --> 01:00:06.836 A:middle
URLSession is really focused on

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.046 A:middle
HTTP, but Stream Task provides

01:00:09.636 --> 01:00:11.716 A:middle
pretty simple access to TCP and

01:00:11.716 --> 01:00:12.686 A:middle
TLS connections.

01:00:13.586 --> 01:00:14.856 A:middle
If you need something more

01:00:14.856 --> 01:00:16.516 A:middle
advanced, Network.framework

01:00:16.516 --> 01:00:18.376 A:middle
gives you great support for TCP,

01:00:18.726 --> 01:00:20.776 A:middle
TLS, UDP, DTLS.

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.696 A:middle
It handles listening for inbound

01:00:22.696 --> 01:00:23.896 A:middle
connections as well as outbound

01:00:23.896 --> 01:00:25.606 A:middle
connections, and we've got Path

01:00:25.606 --> 01:00:26.876 A:middle
Monitor to handle some of the

01:00:26.876 --> 01:00:27.666 A:middle
mobility stuff.

01:00:28.006 --> 01:00:30.986 A:middle
Next steps, we really want to

01:00:30.986 --> 01:00:32.806 A:middle
see you adopt these, adopt

01:00:32.806 --> 01:00:33.756 A:middle
Network.framework and

01:00:33.756 --> 01:00:34.516 A:middle
URLSession.

01:00:35.116 --> 01:00:35.936 A:middle
Your customers are going to

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:37.016 A:middle
appreciate how much better your

01:00:37.016 --> 01:00:38.676 A:middle
connections, how much more

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:39.736 A:middle
reliable your connections are

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:40.876 A:middle
established, and they'll

01:00:40.876 --> 01:00:42.006 A:middle
appreciate the longer battery

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:42.606 A:middle
life from the better

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:43.216 A:middle
performance.

01:00:45.156 --> 01:00:46.066 A:middle
While you're working on these,

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:48.866 A:middle
focus on how you're handling

01:00:48.866 --> 01:00:50.166 A:middle
your sending and receiving to

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:50.946 A:middle
really optimize that

01:00:50.946 --> 01:00:51.536 A:middle
performance.

01:00:52.146 --> 01:00:53.446 A:middle
And take a lot of time to get

01:00:53.446 --> 01:00:55.386 A:middle
that support for the viability

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:57.186 A:middle
and better route changes in

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:57.356 A:middle
there.

01:00:57.506 --> 01:00:59.136 A:middle
It can make all the difference

01:00:59.136 --> 01:01:00.016 A:middle
for providing a seamless
