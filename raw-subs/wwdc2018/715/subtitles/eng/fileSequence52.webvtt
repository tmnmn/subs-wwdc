00:51:59.646 --> 00:52:02.306 A:middle
receive data out the interface

00:52:02.306 --> 00:52:04.206 A:middle
it has a valid route.

00:52:04.996 --> 00:52:06.896 A:middle
So to give a demonstration of

00:52:06.896 --> 00:52:08.526 A:middle
this, let's say that you started

00:52:08.526 --> 00:52:10.266 A:middle
your connection when the device

00:52:10.406 --> 00:52:11.806 A:middle
was associated with a WiFi

00:52:11.806 --> 00:52:12.176 A:middle
network.

00:52:13.456 --> 00:52:16.266 A:middle
Then, your user walks into the

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.796 A:middle
elevator, they don't have a

00:52:17.796 --> 00:52:18.506 A:middle
signal anymore.

00:52:19.216 --> 00:52:20.686 A:middle
At this point, we will give you

00:52:20.686 --> 00:52:23.176 A:middle
an event, letting you know that

00:52:23.176 --> 00:52:24.476 A:middle
your connection is no longer

00:52:24.476 --> 00:52:24.906 A:middle
viable.

00:52:25.826 --> 00:52:27.086 A:middle
So what should you do at this

00:52:27.086 --> 00:52:27.356 A:middle
point?

00:52:28.006 --> 00:52:29.666 A:middle
Two things.

00:52:30.466 --> 00:52:31.486 A:middle
We recommend that if it's

00:52:31.486 --> 00:52:32.876 A:middle
appropriate for your app, you

00:52:32.876 --> 00:52:34.246 A:middle
can let the user know that they

00:52:34.296 --> 00:52:35.736 A:middle
currently have no connectivity.

00:52:36.306 --> 00:52:37.436 A:middle
If they're trying to send and

00:52:37.436 --> 00:52:38.976 A:middle
receive data, it's not going to

00:52:38.976 --> 00:52:39.726 A:middle
work right now.

00:52:41.176 --> 00:52:43.156 A:middle
But, don't necessarily tear down

00:52:43.156 --> 00:52:43.776 A:middle
your connection.

00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:46.106 A:middle
At this point, you don't have

00:52:46.106 --> 00:52:47.176 A:middle
any better interface that you

00:52:47.176 --> 00:52:49.696 A:middle
could use anyway, and that first

00:52:49.696 --> 00:52:51.086 A:middle
WiFi interface may come back.

00:52:51.936 --> 00:52:53.466 A:middle
Oftentimes, if you walk back out

00:52:53.466 --> 00:52:54.616 A:middle
of an elevator onto the same

00:52:54.616 --> 00:52:56.206 A:middle
WiFi network, your connection

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.596 A:middle
can resume right where you left

00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:57.796 A:middle
off.

00:52:58.466 --> 00:53:01.686 A:middle
So the other event that we give
