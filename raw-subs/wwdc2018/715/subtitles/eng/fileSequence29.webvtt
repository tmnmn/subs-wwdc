00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:01.206 A:middle
where an endpoint is added, and

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.476 A:middle
if it's of service type, I tell

00:29:03.476 --> 00:29:05.006 A:middle
the rest of the application the

00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:06.446 A:middle
name that is being advertised,

00:29:06.586 --> 00:29:07.796 A:middle
that default device name that I

00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:08.956 A:middle
ask the system to provide so

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:10.506 A:middle
that I can display it in the UI

00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:11.586 A:middle
and have my users type it in

00:29:11.586 --> 00:29:11.976 A:middle
somewhere else.

00:29:20.046 --> 00:29:20.916 A:middle
I'm going to set a new

00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:22.246 A:middle
connection handler on the

00:29:22.246 --> 00:29:23.766 A:middle
listener, which will be called

00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:25.046 A:middle
every time the listener receives

00:29:25.046 --> 00:29:26.046 A:middle
a new incoming connection.

00:29:26.116 --> 00:29:28.906 A:middle
I could do some configuration on

00:29:28.906 --> 00:29:29.986 A:middle
these connections, but the

00:29:29.986 --> 00:29:31.136 A:middle
default settings are fine here,

00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:31.996 A:middle
so I simply call

00:29:31.996 --> 00:29:34.536 A:middle
connection.start and pass it to

00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:36.286 A:middle
queue.

00:29:36.466 --> 00:29:38.216 A:middle
Here, I notify the rest of the

00:29:38.216 --> 00:29:39.746 A:middle
application that I've received

00:29:39.746 --> 00:29:41.076 A:middle
an incoming connection, so it

00:29:41.076 --> 00:29:42.336 A:middle
can start warming up the display

00:29:42.336 --> 00:29:43.766 A:middle
pipeline and become ready to

00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:45.106 A:middle
display the video frames.

00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:47.976 A:middle
I'll also call receive on

00:29:47.976 --> 00:29:49.406 A:middle
myself, which we'll implement in

00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:50.666 A:middle
a minute, to start reading that

00:29:50.666 --> 00:29:52.016 A:middle
data off of the network and

00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:52.966 A:middle
shipping it up to the display

00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:53.326 A:middle
pipeline.

00:29:53.326 --> 00:29:56.736 A:middle
Just like with connections,

00:29:57.056 --> 00:30:01.756 A:middle
listeners have state update
