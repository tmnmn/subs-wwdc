00:42:59.166 --> 00:43:02.056 A:middle
send initial data in the first

00:43:02.196 --> 00:43:03.856 A:middle
packet that TCP sends out, in

00:43:03.856 --> 00:43:05.386 A:middle
the SYN, so that you don't have

00:43:05.386 --> 00:43:07.046 A:middle
to wait for a whole handshake to

00:43:07.046 --> 00:43:08.766 A:middle
start sending your application

00:43:09.406 --> 00:43:09.536 A:middle
data.

00:43:10.156 --> 00:43:11.976 A:middle
Now in order to do this, you

00:43:11.976 --> 00:43:13.546 A:middle
need to enter into a contract

00:43:13.546 --> 00:43:15.156 A:middle
from your application with the

00:43:15.156 --> 00:43:17.526 A:middle
connection saying that you will

00:43:17.526 --> 00:43:19.016 A:middle
be providing this initial data

00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:19.676 A:middle
to send out.

00:43:20.716 --> 00:43:22.076 A:middle
So to enable this, you mark

00:43:22.236 --> 00:43:23.576 A:middle
allow fast open on your

00:43:23.576 --> 00:43:24.286 A:middle
parameters.

00:43:24.996 --> 00:43:26.426 A:middle
You then create your connection,

00:43:27.436 --> 00:43:28.806 A:middle
and then before you can call

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.796 A:middle
start, you can actually call

00:43:30.856 --> 00:43:32.806 A:middle
send and get your initial data

00:43:33.056 --> 00:43:33.676 A:middle
sent out.

00:43:33.856 --> 00:43:36.536 A:middle
Now I want to point out here

00:43:36.536 --> 00:43:38.116 A:middle
that the completion handler here

00:43:38.226 --> 00:43:39.816 A:middle
is replaced by a marker that

00:43:39.816 --> 00:43:41.886 A:middle
this data is item potent, and

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:43.226 A:middle
item potent means that the data

00:43:43.226 --> 00:43:44.896 A:middle
is safe to be replayed because

00:43:44.896 --> 00:43:46.966 A:middle
initial data may get resent over

00:43:46.966 --> 00:43:48.256 A:middle
the network, and so you don't

00:43:48.256 --> 00:43:49.756 A:middle
want it to have side effects if

00:43:49.756 --> 00:43:51.086 A:middle
it gets resent.

00:43:52.776 --> 00:43:55.266 A:middle
Then, you simply call start, and

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:56.656 A:middle
as we're doing the connection

00:43:56.656 --> 00:43:58.106 A:middle
bring up, all the attempts that

00:43:58.106 --> 00:43:59.916 A:middle
we mentioned before, we will use

00:43:59.916 --> 00:44:01.826 A:middle
that initial data if we can to
