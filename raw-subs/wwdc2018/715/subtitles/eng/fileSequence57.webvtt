00:57:01.156 --> 00:57:02.946 A:middle
It allows you to iterate all of

00:57:02.946 --> 00:57:04.886 A:middle
the interfaces that you can

00:57:04.886 --> 00:57:06.616 A:middle
connect over in case you want to

00:57:06.646 --> 00:57:07.926 A:middle
make a connection over each one,

00:57:08.846 --> 00:57:10.156 A:middle
and it will let you know

00:57:10.156 --> 00:57:11.766 A:middle
whenever those networks do

00:57:11.766 --> 00:57:12.196 A:middle
change.

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.606 A:middle
So this can be very useful if

00:57:14.606 --> 00:57:16.226 A:middle
you want to update your UI to

00:57:16.226 --> 00:57:17.956 A:middle
let the user know, are they

00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:18.726 A:middle
connected at all.

00:57:18.726 --> 00:57:21.396 A:middle
And as Stuart mentioned in the

00:57:21.396 --> 00:57:22.976 A:middle
previous session, there could be

00:57:22.976 --> 00:57:25.676 A:middle
scenarios in which the user has

00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:27.026 A:middle
a long form to fill out and they

00:57:27.026 --> 00:57:28.756 A:middle
don't necessarily want to go and

00:57:28.816 --> 00:57:29.926 A:middle
fill out something just to

00:57:29.926 --> 00:57:30.676 A:middle
realize that there's no

00:57:30.676 --> 00:57:31.766 A:middle
connectivity anyway.

00:57:32.806 --> 00:57:34.696 A:middle
So use Network Path Monitor in

00:57:34.696 --> 00:57:36.886 A:middle
any of these scenarios in which

00:57:37.116 --> 00:57:38.506 A:middle
just having a waiting connection

00:57:38.566 --> 00:57:39.376 A:middle
is not enough.

00:57:39.986 --> 00:57:41.126 A:middle
So between all of these things,

00:57:41.126 --> 00:57:42.226 A:middle
we'd really like to see people

00:57:42.226 --> 00:57:44.956 A:middle
move off of reachability and

00:57:44.956 --> 00:57:46.936 A:middle
handle network transitions more

00:57:46.936 --> 00:57:48.316 A:middle
gracefully than ever before.

00:57:48.926 --> 00:57:52.036 A:middle
So with that, I'd like to invite

00:57:52.086 --> 00:57:53.546 A:middle
Josh back up to the state to let

00:57:53.546 --> 00:57:54.396 A:middle
you know how you can get

00:57:54.396 --> 00:57:56.116 A:middle
involved and start adopting

00:57:56.116 --> 00:57:56.736 A:middle
Network.framework.
