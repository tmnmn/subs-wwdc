00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
It brings convenience and

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.396 A:middle
security to the signup process.

00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:05.646 A:middle
Users no longer need to think

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:07.446 A:middle
about or worry about passwords.

00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:10.616 A:middle
Autofill even suggests usernames

00:12:10.716 --> 00:12:12.046 A:middle
to ease the signup process.

00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:14.466 A:middle
With Automatic Strong Passwords,

00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:16.346 A:middle
account creation is only a few

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:16.956 A:middle
taps away.

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:18.836 A:middle
So, users are more likely to

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:20.436 A:middle
sign up and user your services.

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:23.446 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk about how

00:12:23.446 --> 00:12:25.026 A:middle
Automatic Strong Passwords

00:12:25.026 --> 00:12:25.326 A:middle
works.

00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:28.506 A:middle
Similar to what Chelsea

00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.346 A:middle
explained in a login scenario,

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.476 A:middle
when your app presents a view

00:12:32.476 --> 00:12:34.286 A:middle
controller Autofill infers its

00:12:34.376 --> 00:12:34.586 A:middle
type.

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:36.506 A:middle
In this case, it's a signup view

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:36.966 A:middle
controller.

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:40.106 A:middle
It will then check the

00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:42.486 A:middle
eligibility of your-- it will

00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:43.926 A:middle
then check the eligibility of

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:46.326 A:middle
your app based on the associated

00:12:46.326 --> 00:12:48.296 A:middle
domains to figure out if it can

00:12:48.356 --> 00:12:49.056 A:middle
save passwords.

00:12:49.196 --> 00:12:51.346 A:middle
If that's the case, Autofill

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:53.776 A:middle
will then detect relevant signup

00:12:53.816 --> 00:12:56.486 A:middle
form elements; the username and

00:12:57.436 --> 00:12:58.436 A:middle
the password.

00:12:58.566 --> 00:13:00.206 A:middle
Once the username field become
