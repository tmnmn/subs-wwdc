00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:00.986 A:middle
password content type.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.526 A:middle
If you've chosen not to use

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:04.956 A:middle
Secure Text Entry for your

00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:06.446 A:middle
password fields, it's

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.116 A:middle
particularly important that you

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:09.086 A:middle
tag your fields with the

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:10.186 A:middle
password content type.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:11.626 A:middle
This way, we know we're in a

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:12.586 A:middle
password context.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:15.306 A:middle
Now, that we've discussed how to

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:16.746 A:middle
get Password Autofill working in

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:18.376 A:middle
your app, let's talk about some

00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:19.436 A:middle
improvements that it has.

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:23.626 A:middle
Since, iOS 11.3, WKWebView

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:25.126 A:middle
supports Password Autofill.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:27.236 A:middle
This helps your users if your

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:28.626 A:middle
login screen is implemented

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:29.996 A:middle
using Web technologies.

00:07:30.676 --> 00:07:34.316 A:middle
New to iOS 12, password managers

00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:36.046 A:middle
from the app store can provide

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:37.406 A:middle
information to Autofill.

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:39.896 A:middle
This means that any work you do

00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:41.586 A:middle
to support the iCloud Keychain

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.856 A:middle
Password Manager filling

00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:44.556 A:middle
credentials in your app, also,

00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:45.816 A:middle
helps users of these other

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.276 A:middle
password managers, as well.

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:49.656 A:middle
If you're a developer of a

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:51.306 A:middle
password manager, see

00:07:51.306 --> 00:07:52.916 A:middle
Implementing Autofill Credential

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:54.146 A:middle
Provider Extensions.

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:58.976 A:middle
On iOS 12, we now offer to save

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.836 A:middle
credentials when a user logs
