00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:00.176 A:middle
message that looks something

00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:00.716 A:middle
like this?

00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:02.706 A:middle
All right.

00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:04.506 A:middle
I think it's fair to say that

00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:05.746 A:middle
most of us have to deal with

00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:07.066 A:middle
these codes on a fairly regular

00:23:07.066 --> 00:23:07.956 A:middle
basis, these days.

00:23:08.886 --> 00:23:09.216 A:middle
All right.

00:23:09.216 --> 00:23:10.776 A:middle
Question of the second, after

00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:11.666 A:middle
getting one of these text

00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.516 A:middle
messages how many of you go

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:14.726 A:middle
through a process like this?

00:23:15.466 --> 00:23:16.206 A:middle
Where you think you have the

00:23:16.206 --> 00:23:18.296 A:middle
code memorized, you type it in,

00:23:18.936 --> 00:23:20.256 A:middle
you switch the last two digits

00:23:20.256 --> 00:23:21.896 A:middle
around, and then you have to do

00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:22.596 A:middle
it all over, again.

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:24.516 A:middle
Let me see those hands.

00:23:26.536 --> 00:23:27.146 A:middle
All right.

00:23:27.786 --> 00:23:28.676 A:middle
Final question.

00:23:29.896 --> 00:23:30.786 A:middle
After going through this

00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:33.076 A:middle
process, how many of you feel

00:23:33.076 --> 00:23:34.826 A:middle
something like this?

00:23:36.856 --> 00:23:38.086 A:middle
All right.

00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:40.106 A:middle
So, let me tell you it doesn't

00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:40.976 A:middle
have to be this way.

00:23:41.516 --> 00:23:43.586 A:middle
Because starting in iOS 12 and

00:23:43.586 --> 00:23:45.776 A:middle
macOS Mojave, we're introducing

00:23:45.956 --> 00:23:47.206 A:middle
Security Code Autofill.

00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:49.836 A:middle
A brand new feature which takes

00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:52.076 A:middle
all the pain and frustration out

00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:53.886 A:middle
of message based second factor

00:23:53.886 --> 00:23:54.336 A:middle
flows.

00:23:54.896 --> 00:23:57.876 A:middle
Now, it is important to note

00:23:58.286 --> 00:24:00.036 A:middle
that Security Code Autofill does
