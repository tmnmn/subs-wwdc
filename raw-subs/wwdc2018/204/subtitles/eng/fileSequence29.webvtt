00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.506 A:middle
audience, we are introducing in

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:03.106 A:middle
iOS 12 a new API to support such

00:29:03.106 --> 00:29:03.566 A:middle
flows.

00:29:04.156 --> 00:29:04.916 A:middle
We call it

00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:06.976 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession and I

00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:08.086 A:middle
would like to show you how it

00:29:08.086 --> 00:29:08.476 A:middle
works.

00:29:09.016 --> 00:29:12.136 A:middle
Now, here I am back in the Shiny

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:12.336 A:middle
app.

00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.226 A:middle
And this time I will choose to

00:29:14.226 --> 00:29:16.696 A:middle
log in with example.com, a super

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:17.906 A:middle
popular social network.

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:21.566 A:middle
Now, as soon as I tap the button

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.376 A:middle
the app under the hood calls in

00:29:23.376 --> 00:29:23.976 A:middle
to the new

00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.716 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession API.

00:29:26.636 --> 00:29:28.316 A:middle
Now, one of the ways in which

00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:30.096 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession makes

00:29:30.096 --> 00:29:32.406 A:middle
logins faster is by sharing its

00:29:32.406 --> 00:29:33.606 A:middle
underlying cookie storage with

00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:34.136 A:middle
Safari.

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.896 A:middle
Now, of course, before we do any

00:29:36.896 --> 00:29:39.176 A:middle
of this, iOS asks for explicit

00:29:39.176 --> 00:29:39.886 A:middle
user consent.

00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:43.806 A:middle
Upon consenting, the user is

00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:44.926 A:middle
presented with a secure view

00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:46.796 A:middle
controller and guided through

00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:48.266 A:middle
the third party's federated

00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:49.206 A:middle
authentication flow.

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:52.576 A:middle
In this case, I'm already signed

00:29:52.576 --> 00:29:55.356 A:middle
into example.com in Safari on my

00:29:55.356 --> 00:29:57.046 A:middle
iPhone, so all I have to do is

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:57.656 A:middle
tap Allow.

00:29:57.806 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
There we go.
