00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:00.716 A:middle
The generated passwords are 20

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:01.556 A:middle
characters long.

00:15:02.496 --> 00:15:05.516 A:middle
They contain uppercase, digits,

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:09.036 A:middle
hyphen, and lowercase

00:15:09.036 --> 00:15:09.566 A:middle
characters.

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.356 A:middle
This gives you a strong password

00:15:12.356 --> 00:15:13.926 A:middle
with more than 71 bits of

00:15:13.926 --> 00:15:14.406 A:middle
entropy.

00:15:15.636 --> 00:15:17.386 A:middle
We designed this to be a strong,

00:15:17.386 --> 00:15:18.716 A:middle
yet compatible with most

00:15:18.716 --> 00:15:19.276 A:middle
services.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:22.526 A:middle
It is, of course, possible for

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:24.246 A:middle
your apps to define their own

00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:25.276 A:middle
custom password rules.

00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:28.746 A:middle
As I mentioned before, in most

00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:30.096 A:middle
cases, you don't need to do this

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.526 A:middle
because the default format of

00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:32.966 A:middle
Automatic Strong Passwords

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:33.896 A:middle
should be compatible.

00:15:34.616 --> 00:15:36.846 A:middle
However, if your app's backend

00:15:36.846 --> 00:15:38.556 A:middle
requires a separate set of rules

00:15:38.556 --> 00:15:40.216 A:middle
that are not compatible with the

00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:41.586 A:middle
default format of Automatic

00:15:41.586 --> 00:15:43.136 A:middle
Strong Passwords, you could

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:44.196 A:middle
define your own rules.

00:15:45.396 --> 00:15:47.526 A:middle
To do so, use the new password

00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:49.496 A:middle
rules language in iOS 12.

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:51.936 A:middle
Following the format of the

00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:53.846 A:middle
password rules language, create

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:54.936 A:middle
a rulesDescriptor.

00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:57.856 A:middle
Using the rulesDescriptor create

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.046 A:middle
an instance of

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.506 A:middle
UITextInputPasswordRules and
