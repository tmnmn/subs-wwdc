00:24:57.436 --> 00:25:00.306 A:middle
We've told you this before but

00:25:00.346 --> 00:25:01.266 A:middle
tag your fields.

00:25:02.026 --> 00:25:03.736 A:middle
In iOS 12 we're introducing a

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:05.956 A:middle
new UITextContentType with the

00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:07.576 A:middle
value oneTimeCode.

00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:10.016 A:middle
Tag your security code fields

00:25:10.016 --> 00:25:11.646 A:middle
with this and Security Code

00:25:11.646 --> 00:25:15.876 A:middle
Autofill will work every time.

00:25:15.876 --> 00:25:17.586 A:middle
Additionally, it is very

00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:19.096 A:middle
important that you allow usage

00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:20.476 A:middle
of the system keyboard for

00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:21.546 A:middle
inputting these codes.

00:25:22.426 --> 00:25:23.836 A:middle
Tempting as it may be, you

00:25:23.836 --> 00:25:24.956 A:middle
should refrain from building

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.766 A:middle
Bespoke keyboard UI's within

00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:28.986 A:middle
your view hierarchy or setting

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:30.196 A:middle
custom input views in your

00:25:30.196 --> 00:25:30.786 A:middle
controls.

00:25:31.186 --> 00:25:32.716 A:middle
Because if you do so you are

00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:34.616 A:middle
preventing iOS from surfacing

00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:36.776 A:middle
the necessary UI or injecting

00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:38.186 A:middle
the appropriate events to type

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:39.296 A:middle
the code in on behalf of your

00:25:39.296 --> 00:25:39.886 A:middle
users.

00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:42.096 A:middle
And additionally, you may be

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:43.196 A:middle
hampering the experience of

00:25:43.196 --> 00:25:44.126 A:middle
folks that leverage

00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:45.486 A:middle
accessibility technologies like

00:25:45.486 --> 00:25:46.066 A:middle
voiceover.

00:25:46.626 --> 00:25:49.116 A:middle
So, bottom line is let the

00:25:49.116 --> 00:25:50.496 A:middle
system keyboard do the heavy

00:25:50.496 --> 00:25:52.186 A:middle
lifting for you and Security

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:53.766 A:middle
Code Autofill will work every

00:25:53.766 --> 00:25:54.116 A:middle
time.

00:25:54.726 --> 00:25:58.116 A:middle
Another step that you can take

00:25:58.496 --> 00:25:59.736 A:middle
to ensure that Security Code

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
Autofill works great with your
