appropriately inside of your app

00:27:01.056 --> 00:27:02.856 A:middle
or website, please let us know

00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:04.336 A:middle
by filing a bug report.

00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:07.766 A:middle
We'll be looking out for them.

00:27:07.966 --> 00:27:10.786 A:middle
So, so far, we've talked about

00:27:10.786 --> 00:27:12.096 A:middle
getting Security Code Autofill

00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:14.886 A:middle
to work within your native iOS

00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:15.736 A:middle
apps.

00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:18.266 A:middle
Security Code Autofill is also

00:27:18.266 --> 00:27:20.556 A:middle
available in iOS Safari on

00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:23.166 A:middle
websites and, and this is pretty

00:27:23.166 --> 00:27:25.556 A:middle
cool, if your users are signing

00:27:25.556 --> 00:27:27.366 A:middle
into your service in Safari on

00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:28.946 A:middle
their Mac, text message

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.336 A:middle
forwarding securely pushes

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:31.666 A:middle
incoming messages from their

00:27:31.736 --> 00:27:32.636 A:middle
iPhone to their Mac.

00:27:32.886 --> 00:27:34.096 A:middle
Now, what this means is that

00:27:34.096 --> 00:27:35.566 A:middle
they can fill in a security code

00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:37.126 A:middle
with a single click in Safari's

00:27:37.126 --> 00:27:37.946 A:middle
completion UI.

00:27:38.186 --> 00:27:39.216 A:middle
You no longer have to switch

00:27:39.216 --> 00:27:40.696 A:middle
back to Messages to copy the

00:27:40.696 --> 00:27:42.346 A:middle
code out or, you know, go find

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:43.356 A:middle
your iPhone all the way across

00:27:43.356 --> 00:27:43.676 A:middle
your home.

00:27:43.676 --> 00:27:44.326 A:middle
It's really cool.

00:27:45.516 --> 00:27:50.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:51.296 --> 00:27:52.906 A:middle
To support Security Code

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:54.776 A:middle
Autofill in Safari, we are

00:27:54.776 --> 00:27:56.226 A:middle
introducing a new input

00:27:56.226 --> 00:27:57.926 A:middle
autocomplete attribute value

00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.216 A:middle
one-time-code.
