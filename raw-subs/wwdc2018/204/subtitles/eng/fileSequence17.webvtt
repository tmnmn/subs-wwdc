00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:01.056 A:middle
I'll tap on Create Account.

00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:02.916 A:middle
Tap on Email.

00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:05.665 A:middle
And I don't see any suggested

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:06.126 A:middle
username.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.606 A:middle
When I tap on the Password field

00:17:08.606 --> 00:17:10.236 A:middle
I don't see any Automatic Strong

00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:11.406 A:middle
Passwords suggestion, either.

00:17:11.726 --> 00:17:13.465 A:middle
So, let's go back to Xcode and

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.526 A:middle
investigate this, further.

00:17:14.636 --> 00:17:20.306 A:middle
The first thing to make sure of

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.476 A:middle
is associated domains for your

00:17:22.476 --> 00:17:22.816 A:middle
apps.

00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:25.136 A:middle
In this case, I've already

00:17:25.136 --> 00:17:26.576 A:middle
ensure that Shiny has an

00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:27.536 A:middle
associated domain.

00:17:27.816 --> 00:17:30.046 A:middle
In fact, earlier today I was

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:31.866 A:middle
able to get Autofill suggestions

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:33.116 A:middle
when I wanted to logging into

00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:33.476 A:middle
Shiny.

00:17:34.496 --> 00:17:37.666 A:middle
Next, you should take a look.

00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.036 A:middle
You should take a closer look at

00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:40.286 A:middle
your signup view controller.

00:17:40.856 --> 00:17:44.326 A:middle
I'll click on the Email field.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:49.266 A:middle
And here, under Text Input

00:17:49.266 --> 00:17:51.286 A:middle
Traits, Content Type, I see that

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:52.706 A:middle
I'm correctly setting the

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:53.966 A:middle
content type to username.

00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:57.586 A:middle
And because I want the format of

00:17:57.586 --> 00:17:58.906 A:middle
this username to be of type

00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:00.876 A:middle
email address, I'm also
