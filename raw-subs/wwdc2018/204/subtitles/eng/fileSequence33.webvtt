00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.016 A:middle
that we built right into iOS 12

00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:01.216 A:middle
and macOS Mojave.

00:33:01.786 --> 00:33:02.596 A:middle
Thank you, very much.

[ Applause ]

00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:09.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Harris.

00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:11.486 A:middle
I'm really excited to tell you

00:33:11.486 --> 00:33:12.846 A:middle
about some of the new features

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:14.016 A:middle
that the iCloud Keychain

00:33:14.016 --> 00:33:15.566 A:middle
Password Manager gives you in

00:33:15.756 --> 00:33:17.566 A:middle
iOS 12 and macOS Mojave.

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:19.536 A:middle
You may have seen some of these

00:33:19.536 --> 00:33:20.426 A:middle
in the State of the Union,

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:20.836 A:middle
yesterday.

00:33:21.506 --> 00:33:24.316 A:middle
What we've talked about, so far,

00:33:24.716 --> 00:33:26.186 A:middle
is how you can help users log

00:33:26.186 --> 00:33:27.716 A:middle
into and create accounts in your

00:33:28.496 --> 00:33:28.563 A:middle
app.

00:33:28.836 --> 00:33:30.456 A:middle
However, there are some cases

00:33:30.456 --> 00:33:31.786 A:middle
when users will be interacting

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:33.156 A:middle
with accounts for your app when

00:33:33.156 --> 00:33:34.386 A:middle
they're outside of the context

00:33:34.386 --> 00:33:34.636 A:middle
of your app.

00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:37.276 A:middle
For these cases we've added some

00:33:37.276 --> 00:33:38.646 A:middle
features to the iCloud Keychain

00:33:38.646 --> 00:33:40.086 A:middle
Password Manager to make

00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:41.676 A:middle
managing and interacting with

00:33:41.676 --> 00:33:42.786 A:middle
these accounts a breeze.

00:33:43.426 --> 00:33:45.776 A:middle
If a user needs to look up a

00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:47.266 A:middle
password, they can now simply

00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:48.046 A:middle
ask Siri.

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:50.046 A:middle
They'll be taken right to their

00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:51.686 A:middle
password after authentication.

00:33:52.206 --> 00:33:53.286 A:middle
This way, they can read off

00:33:53.286 --> 00:33:54.676 A:middle
their password to type into

00:33:54.676 --> 00:33:56.886 A:middle
another device that doesn't have

00:33:57.346 --> 00:33:58.586 A:middle
iCloud Keychain.

00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:00.226 A:middle
Some users may share account
