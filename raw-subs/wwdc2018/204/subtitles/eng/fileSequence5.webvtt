into my app with Automatic

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:02.246 A:middle
Strong Passwords and Password

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:02.746 A:middle
Autofill.

00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:05.976 A:middle
Here's today's agenda.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:07.676 A:middle
First, we're going to do a quick

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.266 A:middle
recap of Password Autofill,

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:11.046 A:middle
since many of the features that

00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:12.416 A:middle
we'll talk about today are built

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:13.696 A:middle
upon that feature.

00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:15.986 A:middle
Next, we'll talk about how to

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.366 A:middle
ensure that Automatic Strong

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.516 A:middle
Passwords works in your app.

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:21.136 A:middle
Then, we'll talk about Security

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:21.936 A:middle
Code Autofill.

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:24.506 A:middle
Next, we'll talk about federated

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:25.496 A:middle
authentication with a

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:26.656 A:middle
third-party service.

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:28.946 A:middle
And finally, we'll discuss some

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.616 A:middle
new password management features

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:31.276 A:middle
that the iCloud Password

00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:33.046 A:middle
Keychain Manager provides.

00:05:33.756 --> 00:05:37.146 A:middle
In iOS 11, we introduced

00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:38.366 A:middle
Password Autofill for apps.

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:40.806 A:middle
Some of the new features that

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:42.306 A:middle
we're going to discuss today are

00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:43.826 A:middle
built upon the same adoption you

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:45.156 A:middle
may have done for that feature.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:50.616 A:middle
Password Autofill helps users

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.286 A:middle
log into your app by surfacing

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.166 A:middle
credentials right on the

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:53.896 A:middle
QuickType bar.

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:55.856 A:middle
Here's a quick recap of how to

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:56.966 A:middle
ensure that it works in your

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:57.866 A:middle
app.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:02.166 A:middle
Passwords in the iCloud Keychain
