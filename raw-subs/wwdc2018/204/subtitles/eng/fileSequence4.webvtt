00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
on the QuickType bar.

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:01.966 A:middle
Going to select that.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.586 A:middle
And then, after Face ID, my

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:05.976 A:middle
password and username are filled

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:06.826 A:middle
and I can log in.

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:10.246 A:middle
Now, I've set up second factor

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:11.096 A:middle
authentication.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:12.806 A:middle
Normally, I'd need to try to

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.326 A:middle
memorize this code or go back to

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:14.906 A:middle
Messages.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:16.625 A:middle
But as you can see, the code

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.106 A:middle
that I just received for second

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.536 A:middle
factor authentication is right

00:04:19.536 --> 00:04:20.416 A:middle
on the QuickType bar.

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.536 A:middle
So, with one tap I can fill the

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:22.956 A:middle
code.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.536 A:middle
Yeah. It's really awesome.

00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:28.508 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:30.336 A:middle
So, I can fill that code,

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:33.136 A:middle
submit, and again, with a

00:04:33.136 --> 00:04:34.696 A:middle
minimal number of taps I'm

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:36.916 A:middle
logged back into Shiny.

00:04:37.206 --> 00:04:39.706 A:middle
Back to the slides.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.836 A:middle
So, as you saw, creating an

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:43.186 A:middle
account with Automatic Strong

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.366 A:middle
Passwords is quick and easy.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:46.656 A:middle
I didn't think about the

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.436 A:middle
password, since one was provided

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:50.036 A:middle
for me and inserted into the

00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:50.846 A:middle
password field.

00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:53.286 A:middle
I also didn't think about the

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:54.806 A:middle
password when logging back into

00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:55.316 A:middle
Shiny.

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.376 A:middle
Passwords have truly become an

00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:59.186 A:middle
implementation detail to logging

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:00.826 A:middle
into my app with Automatic
