Passwords in the iCloud Keychain

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.896 A:middle
Password Manager are stored

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.256 A:middle
based on domains on the Web.

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
Like Apple.com.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:08.696 A:middle
Thus, it's important to have an

00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:11.106 A:middle
association between your app and

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:12.466 A:middle
the domain on the Web.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.536 A:middle
This way, we're able to

00:06:14.536 --> 00:06:16.516 A:middle
confidently surface credentials

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:17.516 A:middle
on the QuickType bar.

00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:19.196 A:middle
You already have this

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:20.686 A:middle
association if you've adopted

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:22.396 A:middle
Universal Links or Handoff.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.346 A:middle
The process of adding this

00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:26.916 A:middle
association is pretty simple.

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:28.686 A:middle
You'll have a small change to

00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:30.986 A:middle
your apps Entitlements file and

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.346 A:middle
you'll serve a file from your

00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:33.186 A:middle
domain on the Web.

00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:35.786 A:middle
If you'd like to see an in-depth

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.746 A:middle
look at how to set this up, see

Introducing Password Autofill

00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:41.716 A:middle
for Apps from WWDC 2017.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.426 A:middle
It's important to always tag

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:46.876 A:middle
your fields with text content

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:48.296 A:middle
type, so that Autofill can be

00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:49.566 A:middle
offered at the right place.

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.886 A:middle
Tag your username fields with

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:53.226 A:middle
the username content type.

00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:55.916 A:middle
Tag fields where users are going

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.276 A:middle
to be filling, or passwords for

00:06:58.276 --> 00:06:59.796 A:middle
existing accounts with a

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:00.986 A:middle
password content type.
