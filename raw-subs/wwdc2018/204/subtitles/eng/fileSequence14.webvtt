00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:20.626 A:middle
Autofill detects username and

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.456 A:middle
password fields, it expects to

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:24.226 A:middle

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:37.396 A:middle
detect username and password

00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:40.976 A:middle
fields on the same screen.

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:42.256 A:middle
