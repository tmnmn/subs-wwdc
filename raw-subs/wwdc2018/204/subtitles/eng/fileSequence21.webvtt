00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:00.836 A:middle
and proceed with the suggested

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:01.196 A:middle
username.

00:21:01.196 --> 00:21:03.796 A:middle
And at this point, the password

00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:05.056 A:middle
should be compatible with the

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.656 A:middle
rules that I just specified.

00:21:06.876 --> 00:21:10.546 A:middle
Let's proceed with the signup.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.000 A:middle
And just like that, I'm in.

00:21:13.508 --> 00:21:15.508 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:16.726 --> 00:21:16.996 A:middle
Thank you.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.206 A:middle
We just saw how easy it is to

00:21:21.206 --> 00:21:22.826 A:middle
make your apps compatible with

00:21:22.826 --> 00:21:24.266 A:middle
Automatic Strong Passwords.

00:21:26.146 --> 00:21:26.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Than you, Reza.

00:21:27.796 --> 00:21:29.186 A:middle
As Reza showed you, these are

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:30.386 A:middle
some steps you can take to

00:21:30.386 --> 00:21:31.706 A:middle
ensure that Automatic Strong

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:32.986 A:middle
Passwords works in your app.

00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:35.696 A:middle
Make sure to associate your app

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:37.266 A:middle
with the domain on the Web, just

00:21:37.266 --> 00:21:38.296 A:middle
like filling and saving

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
passwords.

00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:41.456 A:middle
Make sure to tag your fields

00:21:41.456 --> 00:21:42.816 A:middle
with the username and new

00:21:42.816 --> 00:21:44.406 A:middle
password content types.

00:21:44.876 --> 00:21:48.276 A:middle
Ensure that signup is detected

00:21:48.406 --> 00:21:50.116 A:middle
by checking that when you sign

00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:51.716 A:middle
up for your app the password is

00:21:51.716 --> 00:21:52.076 A:middle
saved.

00:21:53.296 --> 00:21:55.086 A:middle
Most of you will be done after

00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:56.496 A:middle
doing these three things.

00:21:57.056 --> 00:21:58.836 A:middle
However, if your service is not

00:21:58.836 --> 00:22:00.636 A:middle
compatible with Apple's password
