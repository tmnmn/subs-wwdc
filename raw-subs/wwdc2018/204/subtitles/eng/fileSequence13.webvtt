00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:06.466 A:middle

00:13:08.936 --> 00:13:10.046 A:middle
suggested username.

00:13:10.996 --> 00:13:12.306 A:middle

00:13:20.636 --> 00:13:21.646 A:middle
needs to proceed with the

00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:23.096 A:middle
suggested password and sign up.

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:25.666 A:middle

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:26.176 A:middle
the password.

00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:29.246 A:middle

you should take.

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:44.536 A:middle
Many of these steps are

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:46.156 A:middle
identical to those Chelsea

00:13:46.156 --> 00:13:47.436 A:middle
explained to make your apps

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:49.256 A:middle
