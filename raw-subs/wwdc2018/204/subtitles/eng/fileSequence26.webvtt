00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
Autofill works great with your

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.906 A:middle
service is to craft your text

00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:03.896 A:middle
message, accordingly.

00:26:04.906 --> 00:26:07.506 A:middle
iOS and macOS use data detector

00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:09.026 A:middle
heuristics to infer that an

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.726 A:middle
incoming message carries a

00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:11.506 A:middle
security code.

00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:14.346 A:middle
Specifically, our heuristics are

00:26:14.346 --> 00:26:16.256 A:middle
looking for words like code or

00:26:16.256 --> 00:26:18.026 A:middle
passcode in proximity to the

00:26:18.026 --> 00:26:19.106 A:middle
actual code string.

00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:21.266 A:middle
And you can see a few sample

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.946 A:middle
text messages in different

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:24.186 A:middle
languages in the slide behind

00:26:24.186 --> 00:26:24.316 A:middle
me.

00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:27.976 A:middle
Now, verifying that your

00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:29.456 A:middle
specially crafted message

00:26:29.536 --> 00:26:30.986 A:middle
properly triggers the iOS and

00:26:30.986 --> 00:26:32.356 A:middle
macOS heuristics is super

00:26:32.356 --> 00:26:32.706 A:middle
simple.

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:34.906 A:middle
You can be your own best friends

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:36.266 A:middle
and simply text yourselves.

00:26:36.916 --> 00:26:38.116 A:middle
Then, when you go into the

00:26:38.116 --> 00:26:39.916 A:middle
message transcript and you see

00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:41.586 A:middle
the code being underlined and

00:26:41.586 --> 00:26:42.926 A:middle
tapping the code offers you a

00:26:42.926 --> 00:26:44.876 A:middle
Copy Code option, you know you

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:47.946 A:middle
have it right.

00:26:48.146 --> 00:26:49.816 A:middle
Security Code Autofill is

00:26:49.816 --> 00:26:51.256 A:middle
available in all supported

00:26:51.256 --> 00:26:53.136 A:middle
locales of iOS and macOS.

00:26:53.586 --> 00:26:55.706 A:middle
And if after following these

00:26:55.706 --> 00:26:57.226 A:middle
best practices you find that you

00:26:57.226 --> 00:26:58.566 A:middle
cannot get Security Code

00:26:58.566 --> 00:26:59.466 A:middle
Autofill to trigger

00:26:59.466 --> 00:27:01.016 A:middle
appropriately inside of your app
