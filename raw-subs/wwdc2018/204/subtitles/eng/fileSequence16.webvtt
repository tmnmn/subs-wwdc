00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.506 A:middle
UITextInputPasswordRules and

00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:02.816 A:middle
assign it to the password rules

00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:04.236 A:middle
property of UITextField.

00:16:04.726 --> 00:16:06.976 A:middle
Once you do this, Automatic

00:16:06.976 --> 00:16:08.516 A:middle
Strong Passwords will generate

00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:10.056 A:middle
passwords based on these rules.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.516 A:middle
We have also created a new

00:16:13.516 --> 00:16:14.816 A:middle
web-based Password Rules

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:15.606 A:middle
Validation Tool.

00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:18.466 A:middle
Use this tool to ensure the

00:16:18.466 --> 00:16:19.856 A:middle
rules that you specify are

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.196 A:middle
correct and produce the type of

00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:23.466 A:middle
passwords that you expect.

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:25.056 A:middle
I'll talk more about this,

00:16:25.056 --> 00:16:25.436 A:middle
shortly.

00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:30.356 A:middle
Now, that we talked about the

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.306 A:middle
steps it would take to make your

00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:33.886 A:middle
apps compatible with Automatic

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:35.596 A:middle
Strong Passwords, I'd like to

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:36.306 A:middle
show you a demo.

00:16:36.956 --> 00:16:39.806 A:middle
I'm the developer of the Shiny

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:41.126 A:middle
app and I want to make sure that

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.526 A:middle
Shiny is compatible with

00:16:42.526 --> 00:16:43.936 A:middle
Automatic Strong Passwords in

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:44.706 A:middle
iOS 12.

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:47.386 A:middle
So, the first thing to do is to

00:16:47.386 --> 00:16:49.616 A:middle
run Shiny using the iOS 12 SDK

00:16:49.616 --> 00:16:50.856 A:middle
and try it out.

00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:57.666 A:middle
So, in Xcode I'll click on Run.

00:16:57.846 --> 00:16:58.916 A:middle
And here is Shiny.

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:01.056 A:middle
I'll tap on Create Account.
