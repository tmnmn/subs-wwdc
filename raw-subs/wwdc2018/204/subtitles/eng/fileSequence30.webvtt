00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:02.626 A:middle
And with just two taps I've gone

00:30:02.626 --> 00:30:03.816 A:middle
through a full federated

00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:04.816 A:middle
authentication flow with a

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:05.896 A:middle
third-party service.

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:08.736 A:middle
So, in the past you may have

00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:10.376 A:middle
used one of the other iOS

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:11.886 A:middle
platform technologies to

00:30:11.886 --> 00:30:12.896 A:middle
implement federated

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:14.066 A:middle
authentication inside of your

00:30:14.066 --> 00:30:14.426 A:middle
apps.

00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:17.226 A:middle
Starting with iOS 12,

00:30:17.586 --> 00:30:19.146 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession is

00:30:19.146 --> 00:30:21.156 A:middle
the go-to way to implement such

00:30:21.156 --> 00:30:21.606 A:middle
flows.

00:30:22.126 --> 00:30:24.246 A:middle
As we mentioned, already,

00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:26.566 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession makes

00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:28.606 A:middle
login flows faster by sharing

00:30:28.606 --> 00:30:30.036 A:middle
its underlying cookie storage

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:31.986 A:middle
with Safari upon explicit user

00:30:31.986 --> 00:30:32.426 A:middle
consent.

00:30:33.236 --> 00:30:34.636 A:middle
Now, what this means is that

00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:36.216 A:middle
depending on the implementation

00:30:36.216 --> 00:30:37.606 A:middle
of the federated authentication

00:30:37.606 --> 00:30:38.856 A:middle
flow by the third party.

00:30:39.066 --> 00:30:40.626 A:middle
If your user is already signed

00:30:40.626 --> 00:30:42.376 A:middle
into that service in Safari on

00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:43.966 A:middle
their device, they may not even

00:30:43.966 --> 00:30:45.156 A:middle
have to see a login form, at

00:30:45.156 --> 00:30:45.406 A:middle
all.

00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:48.486 A:middle
If they do have to see a login

00:30:48.486 --> 00:30:50.576 A:middle
form ASWebAuthenticationSession

00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:52.466 A:middle
supports Password Autofill and

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:54.146 A:middle
Security Code Autofill to make

00:30:54.146 --> 00:30:55.616 A:middle
the experience as painless as

00:30:55.616 --> 00:30:56.046 A:middle
possible.

00:30:57.506 --> 00:30:58.736 A:middle
And for you developers,

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:00.486 A:middle
ASWebAuthenticationSession
