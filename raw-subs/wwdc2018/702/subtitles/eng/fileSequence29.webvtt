00:28:59.276 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
job of preventing widespread

00:29:00.716 --> 00:29:02.016 A:middle
outbreaks of malicious software.

00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:04.096 A:middle
And today, we are making the

00:29:04.096 --> 00:29:06.046 A:middle
Developer ID program even safer

00:29:06.486 --> 00:29:07.796 A:middle
with the introduction of app

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:08.606 A:middle
notarization.

00:29:09.186 --> 00:29:11.756 A:middle
Now app notarization is a

00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:13.256 A:middle
process designed to help

00:29:13.256 --> 00:29:15.096 A:middle
identify and block malicious

00:29:15.096 --> 00:29:17.046 A:middle
software before distribution

00:29:17.726 --> 00:29:19.056 A:middle
while still maintaining all the

00:29:19.056 --> 00:29:20.746 A:middle
flexibility of the Developer ID

00:29:20.746 --> 00:29:21.186 A:middle
program.

00:29:22.196 --> 00:29:23.466 A:middle
That means that you can continue

00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:24.766 A:middle
to ship your apps the way you do

00:29:24.766 --> 00:29:26.636 A:middle
today with the same capabilities

00:29:26.636 --> 00:29:27.326 A:middle
that they have today.

00:29:27.856 --> 00:29:29.646 A:middle
And the key to this is the

00:29:29.646 --> 00:29:31.276 A:middle
Develop ID notary service.

00:29:31.846 --> 00:29:35.096 A:middle
Now the notary service is an

00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:37.236 A:middle
automated service that performs

00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:39.756 A:middle
security checks of Developer ID

00:29:39.756 --> 00:29:40.566 A:middle
signed content.

00:29:41.476 --> 00:29:43.006 A:middle
It's an optional extension to

00:29:43.006 --> 00:29:44.436 A:middle
the Developer ID program, and

00:29:44.736 --> 00:29:48.056 A:middle
it's not an app review.

00:29:48.206 --> 00:29:50.376 A:middle
Starting today, developers can

00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:51.566 A:middle
start uploading

00:29:51.776 --> 00:29:53.566 A:middle
distribution-ready content to

00:29:53.566 --> 00:29:54.456 A:middle
the notary service.

00:29:55.096 --> 00:29:56.016 A:middle
And assuming that those

00:29:56.016 --> 00:29:57.636 A:middle
applications, installer

00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:00.076 A:middle
packages, and disk images don't
