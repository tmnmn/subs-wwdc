00:05:59.906 --> 00:06:03.416 A:middle
If your app uses the system

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:05.676 A:middle
WebKit, then there is nothing

00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:06.736 A:middle
for you to do in order to adopt

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:06.836 A:middle
this.

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:08.586 A:middle
You will automatically benefit

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:09.426 A:middle
from those improvements.

00:06:12.736 --> 00:06:15.006 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:16.076 A:middle
Gatekeeper.

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:17.256 A:middle
So Gatekeeper has done a great

00:06:17.256 --> 00:06:19.116 A:middle
job over the years in stopping

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:21.616 A:middle
widespread malware attacks on

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:22.056 A:middle
the platform.

00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:23.266 A:middle
It's here.

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:24.856 A:middle
We would like to make it better.

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:26.546 A:middle
And we are focusing on three

00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:27.686 A:middle
main aspects.

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:31.446 A:middle
First, I invite Kelly onstage to

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.286 A:middle
tell you about a new security

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.756 A:middle
mechanism that puts the user in

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:38.086 A:middle
control over the way apps access

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:39.496 A:middle
their personal data.

00:06:40.356 --> 00:06:42.366 A:middle
Then I'll introduce a new

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:43.656 A:middle
security feature that you as a

00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:45.836 A:middle
developer can adopt in your apps

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:47.866 A:middle
to increase their security and

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:48.896 A:middle
their transparency.

00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:51.476 A:middle
And then finally, I am sure you

00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:52.616 A:middle
are all very impatient to hear

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:54.426 A:middle
more about the Developer ID

00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:56.146 A:middle
notary service that Sebastian

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:57.306 A:middle
mentioned in his talk yesterday.

00:06:57.976 --> 00:06:59.746 A:middle
So I invite Garrett onstage to

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:02.556 A:middle
tell you more about that.
