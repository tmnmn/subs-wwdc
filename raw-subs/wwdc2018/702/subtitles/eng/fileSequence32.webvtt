00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:00.206 A:middle
be distributed just like before.

00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:02.256 A:middle
And when it ends up on a user's

00:32:02.256 --> 00:32:04.196 A:middle
system, Gatekeeper will verify

00:32:04.196 --> 00:32:05.996 A:middle
notarization and provide the new

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:06.936 A:middle
first-launch experience.

00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:11.796 A:middle
Now because this is a highly

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.396 A:middle
automated process, we are

00:32:13.396 --> 00:32:15.046 A:middle
targeting providing tickets back

00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:16.026 A:middle
within an hour.

00:32:16.776 --> 00:32:17.916 A:middle
But we'll be working to improve

00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:19.496 A:middle
the speed and quality of the

00:32:19.496 --> 00:32:20.996 A:middle
service as we roll it out.

00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:23.256 A:middle
So let's talk a little more

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:24.016 A:middle
about those security

00:32:24.016 --> 00:32:24.876 A:middle
requirements I mentioned

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:25.226 A:middle
earlier.

00:32:26.226 --> 00:32:29.016 A:middle
Well, first and foremost, no

00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:29.906 A:middle
malicious software.

00:32:30.646 --> 00:32:32.966 A:middle
If the security check finds

00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:34.216 A:middle
anything malicious inside of the

00:32:34.216 --> 00:32:35.706 A:middle
Developer ID signed content, it

00:32:35.776 --> 00:32:36.746 A:middle
will immediately create a

00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:37.946 A:middle
special kind of ticket called a

00:32:37.946 --> 00:32:39.636 A:middle
revocation ticket and

00:32:39.636 --> 00:32:40.486 A:middle
immediately notify the

00:32:40.486 --> 00:32:40.906 A:middle
developer.

00:32:42.156 --> 00:32:44.846 A:middle
Second, all executables need to

00:32:44.846 --> 00:32:45.976 A:middle
be properly code signed.

00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:47.976 A:middle
And this is important to make

00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:49.356 A:middle
sure that when the application

00:32:49.356 --> 00:32:50.656 A:middle
ends up on a develop - on a

00:32:50.656 --> 00:32:52.646 A:middle
user's system, Gatekeeper can

00:32:52.646 --> 00:32:53.976 A:middle
verify that it wasn't tampered

00:32:53.976 --> 00:32:54.176 A:middle
with.

00:32:54.666 --> 00:32:58.466 A:middle
And finally, all binaries must

00:32:58.466 --> 00:32:59.786 A:middle
opt into the enhanced runtime

00:32:59.786 --> 00:33:01.446 A:middle
that Pierre described earlier so
