00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:01.976 A:middle
Let's use Mail for an example.

00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:04.196 A:middle
Mail's local database contains

00:13:04.196 --> 00:13:05.596 A:middle
lots of personal information.

00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:07.466 A:middle
It has the e-mail addresses of

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:09.446 A:middle
my friends, family, companies I

00:13:09.446 --> 00:13:10.136 A:middle
do business with.

00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:11.126 A:middle
And then there is the contents

00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:12.746 A:middle
of the mail messages themselves

00:13:13.466 --> 00:13:15.056 A:middle
-- my private correspondence, my

00:13:15.526 --> 00:13:16.866 A:middle
shopping receipts, my shipping

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:19.336 A:middle
notifications, and my temporary

00:13:19.336 --> 00:13:20.926 A:middle
passwords for services I forgot

00:13:20.956 --> 00:13:21.646 A:middle
the password of.

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:24.576 A:middle
So the Mail app necessarily has

00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:25.936 A:middle
access to its own local

00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:26.456 A:middle
database.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.026 A:middle
And in macOS Mojave, other apps

00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:31.066 A:middle
do not.

00:13:32.256 --> 00:13:34.086 A:middle
But since Mail can be scripted

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:35.626 A:middle
by other applications, we need

00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:37.206 A:middle
to be sure that Mail only shares

00:13:37.206 --> 00:13:38.946 A:middle
my personal information with my

00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:39.446 A:middle
consent.

00:13:42.946 --> 00:13:43.956 A:middle
Because we want the user to be

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.286 A:middle
in control of how apps they have

00:13:45.286 --> 00:13:46.586 A:middle
trusted with access to their

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:48.186 A:middle
data act on behalf of other

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:50.886 A:middle
apps, macOS Mojave will include

00:13:50.886 --> 00:13:51.806 A:middle
prompts like this one,

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:53.946 A:middle
authorizing apps to control

00:13:53.946 --> 00:13:54.456 A:middle
other apps.

00:13:55.616 --> 00:13:57.026 A:middle
Now the developer preview does

00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:58.096 A:middle
not currently require

00:13:58.096 --> 00:13:59.556 A:middle
authorization to automate other

00:13:59.556 --> 00:13:59.966 A:middle
apps.
