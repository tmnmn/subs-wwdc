00:08:58.206 --> 00:09:00.106 A:middle
have in macOS High Sierra.

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:03.656 A:middle
Now apps that traverse the

00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:05.746 A:middle
user's Home folder could trigger

00:09:05.856 --> 00:09:08.196 A:middle
multiple approval prompts, not

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.936 A:middle
just for photos -- for contacts,

00:09:09.936 --> 00:09:12.166 A:middle
for calendars, and so on -- as

00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:13.256 A:middle
many apps that traverse the

00:09:13.256 --> 00:09:15.176 A:middle
entire file system, such as disk

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:16.676 A:middle
management or backup software.

00:09:17.886 --> 00:09:19.746 A:middle
So user can pre-approve such

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:22.086 A:middle
apps by adding them to the new

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:24.036 A:middle
System Application Data category

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:25.536 A:middle
in the System Preferences

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:26.846 A:middle
Security and Privacy pane.

00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:28.886 A:middle
By doing so, the user

00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:30.536 A:middle
preauthorizes those apps to

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:31.526 A:middle
access all of their

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:33.426 A:middle
privacy-sensitive data without

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:33.876 A:middle
prompting.

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:35.976 A:middle
Authorization can also be

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:38.796 A:middle
preconfigured in education or

00:09:38.796 --> 00:09:40.996 A:middle
enterprise environments via MDM

00:09:40.996 --> 00:09:42.286 A:middle
server as long as it's a

00:09:42.286 --> 00:09:43.706 A:middle
user-improved enrollment.

00:09:46.256 --> 00:09:47.546 A:middle
When the user is prompted to

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:49.616 A:middle
authorize access to their

00:09:49.616 --> 00:09:51.546 A:middle
personal data, it is important

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:52.886 A:middle
to communicate the purpose of

00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:53.566 A:middle
that access.

00:09:54.456 --> 00:09:56.006 A:middle
Imagine that you just installed

00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:57.536 A:middle
an app that you had never used

00:09:57.586 --> 00:09:58.036 A:middle
before.

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:00.236 A:middle
And the very first time you
