00:38:59.616 --> 00:39:01.246 A:middle
what did I need to access and

00:39:01.246 --> 00:39:03.756 A:middle
why you need to access it, using

00:39:03.756 --> 00:39:05.676 A:middle
new entitlements and purpose

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:06.656 A:middle
strings for this effect.

00:39:07.696 --> 00:39:09.146 A:middle
Also, make sure you request

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.096 A:middle
access to this data in context

00:39:11.096 --> 00:39:12.466 A:middle
-- in the context where the user

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:14.076 A:middle
can actually understand why you

00:39:14.076 --> 00:39:16.436 A:middle
need it and is more likely to

00:39:16.436 --> 00:39:17.396 A:middle
grant you this request.

00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:20.656 A:middle
We have a new higher runtime,

00:39:20.656 --> 00:39:21.696 A:middle
which you can adopt in your app

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:22.026 A:middle
today.

00:39:23.206 --> 00:39:24.736 A:middle
It effectively increases the

00:39:24.736 --> 00:39:26.136 A:middle
security and the transparency of

00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:26.446 A:middle
your app.

00:39:26.966 --> 00:39:28.316 A:middle
It does not take away any of the

00:39:28.316 --> 00:39:29.336 A:middle
capabilities that you have

00:39:29.386 --> 00:39:29.696 A:middle
today.

00:39:30.126 --> 00:39:32.516 A:middle
It just requires you to opt into

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:33.976 A:middle
them.

00:39:34.196 --> 00:39:35.886 A:middle
And finally, please help us make

00:39:36.186 --> 00:39:38.876 A:middle
our users feel more secure and

00:39:38.996 --> 00:39:40.596 A:middle
stop malware as soon as possible

00:39:41.156 --> 00:39:42.376 A:middle
by getting your apps notarized.

00:39:43.096 --> 00:39:44.956 A:middle
The Developer ID notary service

00:39:44.956 --> 00:39:46.206 A:middle
is open for submission right

00:39:46.206 --> 00:39:46.406 A:middle
now.

00:39:47.036 --> 00:39:49.286 A:middle
If you need more information

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:51.026 A:middle
about this session, please check

00:39:51.026 --> 00:39:52.036 A:middle
out our developer website.

00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:55.016 A:middle
We have a lab immediately after

00:39:55.016 --> 00:39:56.726 A:middle
this section from 3:00 to 6:00

00:39:56.876 --> 00:39:58.276 A:middle
and then another lab tomorrow

00:39:58.276 --> 00:40:00.176 A:middle
from 9:00 to 12:00.
