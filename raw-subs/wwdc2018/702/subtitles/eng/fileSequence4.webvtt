00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:00.216 A:middle
only allow UI events to be

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:02.326 A:middle
dispatched by processes that the

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:04.176 A:middle
user has specifically configured

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:06.836 A:middle
to control the UI on their

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:09.186 A:middle
behalf and effectively

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:10.226 A:middle
impersonate them.

00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:13.456 A:middle
This configuration is made in

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:14.976 A:middle
the Security and Privacy Press

00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:17.026 A:middle
pane in the System Preferences.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:19.005 A:middle
And it's currently co-located

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:20.466 A:middle
with the existing accessing to

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:21.466 A:middle
the key list.

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:25.256 A:middle
This is the list of APIs that

00:04:25.526 --> 00:04:26.916 A:middle
will be impacted moving forward.

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:28.416 A:middle
They mostly fall under two

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:29.106 A:middle
categories.

00:04:29.616 --> 00:04:31.546 A:middle
First, the kidlet [phonetic]

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:34.346 A:middle
Layer: IOHIDPostEvent and the

00:04:34.346 --> 00:04:37.026 A:middle
IOHIDSetMouseLocation; and then

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.786 A:middle
second, at the CG Layer.

00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:41.316 A:middle
If you attempt to post any CG

00:04:41.316 --> 00:04:44.376 A:middle
event or if you create any CG

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:46.526 A:middle
event tab, we are now providing

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.126 A:middle
the Listen Only option --

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:50.196 A:middle
effectively creating what we

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:51.276 A:middle
call a modifying tab.

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:52.756 A:middle
And the user will have to

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:53.976 A:middle
approve those processes as well.

00:04:54.956 --> 00:05:01.146 A:middle
And then next, we put a lot of
