00:35:59.316 --> 00:36:00.196 A:middle
notarized properly.

00:36:00.706 --> 00:36:04.376 A:middle
And the last step before you

00:36:04.376 --> 00:36:06.086 A:middle
distribute content is to staple

00:36:06.086 --> 00:36:07.466 A:middle
your notarization ticket to

00:36:07.466 --> 00:36:08.336 A:middle
whatever content you are going

00:36:08.336 --> 00:36:08.836 A:middle
to distribute.

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:10.926 A:middle
Now we have a special tool for

00:36:10.926 --> 00:36:11.716 A:middle
that called Stapler.

00:36:12.406 --> 00:36:13.626 A:middle
Now you can staple tickets

00:36:13.676 --> 00:36:16.296 A:middle
directly to applications, disk

00:36:16.296 --> 00:36:18.326 A:middle
images, and installer packages.

00:36:19.096 --> 00:36:20.326 A:middle
And Stapler combines both

00:36:20.326 --> 00:36:22.246 A:middle
retrieving the ticket and

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.396 A:middle
attaching it to the content in

00:36:23.396 --> 00:36:23.916 A:middle
one easy step.

00:36:24.756 --> 00:36:26.066 A:middle
Here you can see I am stapling

00:36:26.066 --> 00:36:27.096 A:middle
the ticket directly to this

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:27.506 A:middle
image.

00:36:28.346 --> 00:36:29.836 A:middle
After that's done, I can

00:36:29.836 --> 00:36:31.636 A:middle
distribute the disk image, and

00:36:31.686 --> 00:36:33.396 A:middle
the users will already get a

00:36:33.396 --> 00:36:34.416 A:middle
notarized application.

00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:40.376 A:middle
So as a quick reminder, in macOS

00:36:40.376 --> 00:36:42.646 A:middle
Mojave, for non-notarized apps

00:36:42.946 --> 00:36:43.856 A:middle
we'll continue to keep the

00:36:43.856 --> 00:36:45.536 A:middle
first-launch dialog that

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.736 A:middle
Gatekeeper has always had for

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:47.846 A:middle
Developer ID applications.

00:36:48.866 --> 00:36:50.156 A:middle
For notarized applications,

00:36:51.346 --> 00:36:52.166 A:middle
they'll get a new version of

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.696 A:middle
this dialog that prominently

00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:54.886 A:middle
displays the app's icon.

00:36:55.366 --> 00:36:57.856 A:middle
And if the user does manage to

00:36:57.856 --> 00:36:59.856 A:middle
download software that has

00:36:59.856 --> 00:37:02.016 A:middle
malicious content in it, the
