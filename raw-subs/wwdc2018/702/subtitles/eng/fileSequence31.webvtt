00:30:59.686 --> 00:31:01.176 A:middle
simplified overview of the

00:31:01.176 --> 00:31:02.126 A:middle
development process.

00:31:03.486 --> 00:31:05.236 A:middle
Over on the left, a developer

00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:07.036 A:middle
iterates on an application local

00:31:07.036 --> 00:31:08.556 A:middle
to their system building

00:31:08.556 --> 00:31:10.806 A:middle
features, debugging, and signing

00:31:10.806 --> 00:31:11.666 A:middle
with their Mac Developer

00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:12.126 A:middle
certificate.

00:31:13.226 --> 00:31:14.446 A:middle
When the application is ready

00:31:14.446 --> 00:31:17.016 A:middle
for release, it's signed with

00:31:17.016 --> 00:31:18.246 A:middle
the Developer ID certificate,

00:31:18.246 --> 00:31:19.836 A:middle
and a final test task can be

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:20.256 A:middle
performed.

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:23.196 A:middle
After that, the content can be

00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:24.656 A:middle
distributed directly to users --

00:31:24.896 --> 00:31:26.336 A:middle
who can run it -- or Gatekeeper

00:31:26.336 --> 00:31:27.356 A:middle
can verify that it wasn't

00:31:27.356 --> 00:31:29.066 A:middle
tampered with; and the user gets

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:29.896 A:middle
to run your application.

00:31:30.846 --> 00:31:32.136 A:middle
For this app to be notarized,

00:31:32.386 --> 00:31:33.696 A:middle
only one additional step is

00:31:33.696 --> 00:31:34.146 A:middle
required.

00:31:35.616 --> 00:31:37.036 A:middle
You continue to develop locally,

00:31:37.306 --> 00:31:38.116 A:middle
just like before.

00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:40.156 A:middle
And once you sign it with your

00:31:40.156 --> 00:31:42.666 A:middle
Develop ID certificate, a copy

00:31:42.666 --> 00:31:43.696 A:middle
can be uploaded to the Apple

00:31:43.696 --> 00:31:44.486 A:middle
notary service.

00:31:45.256 --> 00:31:46.416 A:middle
Assuming that the Developer ID

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:47.736 A:middle
content doesn't contain anything

00:31:47.736 --> 00:31:50.036 A:middle
malicious, a ticket will be

00:31:50.036 --> 00:31:51.496 A:middle
issued back that can be attached

00:31:51.786 --> 00:31:53.466 A:middle
to the content through a process

00:31:53.466 --> 00:31:54.406 A:middle
we call stapling.

00:31:54.936 --> 00:31:58.786 A:middle
And then the stapled content can

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:00.206 A:middle
be distributed just like before.
