unavailable if they decline.

00:21:02.506 --> 00:21:04.166 A:middle
Access approval-gated resources

00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:05.426 A:middle
from threads other than the main

00:21:05.426 --> 00:21:06.806 A:middle
thread so that your app doesn't

00:21:06.806 --> 00:21:08.056 A:middle
appear to be hung while waiting

00:21:08.096 --> 00:21:08.696 A:middle
for approval.

00:21:09.656 --> 00:21:11.166 A:middle
And gracefully handle failure to

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.926 A:middle
access approval-gated resources

00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:14.506 A:middle
in the event that the user does

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:15.456 A:middle
decline.

00:21:15.986 --> 00:21:18.796 A:middle
But finally, when the user does

00:21:19.096 --> 00:21:21.126 A:middle
consent, be responsible with the

00:21:21.126 --> 00:21:22.046 A:middle
user's personal data.

00:21:22.606 --> 00:21:25.446 A:middle
So these are the new user data

00:21:25.446 --> 00:21:26.776 A:middle
protections available in macOS

00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:27.216 A:middle
Mojave.

00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:28.946 A:middle
Thank you, and I will turn the

00:21:28.946 --> 00:21:30.116 A:middle
stage back to over to Pierre to

00:21:30.116 --> 00:21:31.366 A:middle
tell you about the enhanced

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:31.976 A:middle
runtime protections.

[ Applause ]

00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:39.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Kelly.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:42.516 A:middle
So in the few years since the

00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:43.676 A:middle
maturity of system integrity of

00:21:43.676 --> 00:21:45.526 A:middle
protection to the Mac, a lot of

00:21:45.526 --> 00:21:47.036 A:middle
you have asked us what you could

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:49.126 A:middle
do in your apps to adopt some of

00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:50.566 A:middle
the runtime protections that we

00:21:50.566 --> 00:21:51.356 A:middle
afford to the rest of the

00:21:51.356 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
system.

00:21:53.026 --> 00:21:54.246 A:middle
Until now, there wasn't really a

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:56.346 A:middle
good story for this.

00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:58.896 A:middle
Today, we are introducing a new

00:21:58.896 --> 00:22:00.146 A:middle
set of runtime protections that
