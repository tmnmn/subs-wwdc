00:37:58.216 --> 00:38:00.146 A:middle
for now, will be warnings but

00:38:00.146 --> 00:38:01.156 A:middle
are going to become errors in

00:38:01.156 --> 00:38:01.616 A:middle
the future.

00:38:02.796 --> 00:38:04.236 A:middle
And when macOS Mojave ships

00:38:04.236 --> 00:38:06.216 A:middle
later this year, Gatekeeper will

00:38:06.216 --> 00:38:07.356 A:middle
be highlighting notarized

00:38:07.356 --> 00:38:08.506 A:middle
applications to users.

00:38:09.096 --> 00:38:10.266 A:middle
But then in a future macOS

00:38:10.266 --> 00:38:11.776 A:middle
release, Gatekeeper will be

00:38:11.776 --> 00:38:13.256 A:middle
requiring notarized apps by

00:38:13.256 --> 00:38:13.606 A:middle
default.

00:38:14.116 --> 00:38:16.716 A:middle
And that's all for Gatekeeper.

00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:17.746 A:middle
So now I'd like to hand it back

00:38:17.746 --> 00:38:18.636 A:middle
to Pierre for some closing

00:38:18.636 --> 00:38:18.866 A:middle
words.

00:38:19.516 --> 00:38:27.756 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:38:28.256 --> 00:38:28.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Garrett.

00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:31.556 A:middle
All right, let's look at the key

00:38:31.556 --> 00:38:32.576 A:middle
takeaways from this session.

00:38:33.056 --> 00:38:36.096 A:middle
First, the macOS Mojave, the

00:38:36.376 --> 00:38:38.326 A:middle
user is now in control over the

00:38:38.326 --> 00:38:40.516 A:middle
way apps can access their

00:38:40.686 --> 00:38:41.206 A:middle
personal data.

00:38:42.516 --> 00:38:43.716 A:middle
It means your app needs to be

00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:46.086 A:middle
ready to handle their decisions

00:38:46.386 --> 00:38:48.006 A:middle
-- first, because the user make

00:38:48.006 --> 00:38:49.106 A:middle
take a while before they

00:38:49.106 --> 00:38:50.046 A:middle
actually give you an answer.

00:38:51.106 --> 00:38:52.326 A:middle
Second, because they might

00:38:52.356 --> 00:38:54.866 A:middle
completely decline the request.

00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:56.766 A:middle
Additionally, please be

00:38:56.766 --> 00:38:59.546 A:middle
transparent to the user about

00:38:59.616 --> 00:39:01.246 A:middle
what did I need to access and
