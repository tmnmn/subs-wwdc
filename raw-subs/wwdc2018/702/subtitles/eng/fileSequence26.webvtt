00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:00.686 A:middle
really need it.

00:26:01.296 --> 00:26:02.746 A:middle
If your app is actually a

00:26:02.746 --> 00:26:04.296 A:middle
debugger, then you will use the

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:05.576 A:middle
second entitlement in the list.

00:26:06.466 --> 00:26:07.776 A:middle
And then finally, in the few

00:26:07.776 --> 00:26:09.176 A:middle
rare occasions where your app

00:26:09.766 --> 00:26:11.476 A:middle
needs to rely on the DYLD

00:26:11.476 --> 00:26:12.736 A:middle
environment variables to modify

00:26:12.736 --> 00:26:12.976 A:middle
its BFU [phonetic]

00:26:13.096 --> 00:26:15.756 A:middle
at runtime, then you can use the

00:26:15.756 --> 00:26:19.856 A:middle
last entitlement in this list.

00:26:19.856 --> 00:26:20.766 A:middle
And finally, your resource

00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:23.636 A:middle
access: This runtime requires

00:26:23.636 --> 00:26:25.356 A:middle
you to be transparent about the

00:26:25.356 --> 00:26:27.196 A:middle
kind of data classing that your

00:26:27.196 --> 00:26:28.246 A:middle
app needs to access.

00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:30.176 A:middle
So if your app attempts to

00:26:30.176 --> 00:26:32.736 A:middle
access any data that is part of

00:26:32.736 --> 00:26:34.216 A:middle
one of the protected categories

00:26:34.216 --> 00:26:35.426 A:middle
that Kelly described in his

00:26:35.526 --> 00:26:37.616 A:middle
previous section, and you don't

00:26:37.616 --> 00:26:38.856 A:middle
have the appropriate entitlement

00:26:38.906 --> 00:26:40.296 A:middle
signed in your app, then the

00:26:40.296 --> 00:26:41.346 A:middle
system will automatically

00:26:41.346 --> 00:26:42.446 A:middle
terminate it.

00:26:44.096 --> 00:26:45.786 A:middle
We have entitlements that map to

00:26:45.786 --> 00:26:47.156 A:middle
every single category that Kelly

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:47.646 A:middle
described.

00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:50.986 A:middle
But remember that just adding

00:26:50.986 --> 00:26:52.256 A:middle
this entitlement is not enough.

00:26:53.616 --> 00:26:54.656 A:middle
You also need to add a purpose

00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:55.436 A:middle
string if you are linking

00:26:55.436 --> 00:26:56.586 A:middle
against the 10.14 SDK.

00:26:56.586 --> 00:26:58.876 A:middle
And finally, it does not

00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:00.306 A:middle
automatically grant you access
