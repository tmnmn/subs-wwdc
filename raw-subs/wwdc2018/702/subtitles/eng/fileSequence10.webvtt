00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:00.236 A:middle
And the very first time you

00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:02.256 A:middle
launch it, you saw this prompt.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.006 A:middle
That's a tough decision.

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:06.366 A:middle
But we can make that decision

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:08.736 A:middle
easier by including purpose

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:11.396 A:middle
text, which makes it clear why

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:13.576 A:middle
the app is requesting access and

00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:14.866 A:middle
what the consequences of

00:10:14.866 --> 00:10:16.366 A:middle
declining that access would be.

00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:18.916 A:middle
Now your app can specify the

00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.266 A:middle
text displayed in the

00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:21.736 A:middle
authorization prompts displayed

00:10:21.736 --> 00:10:24.406 A:middle
on its behalf by including keys

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:25.726 A:middle
in your Info.plist file.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:28.806 A:middle
So here are the Info.plist keys

00:10:28.806 --> 00:10:29.986 A:middle
for each of the APIs that we

00:10:29.986 --> 00:10:30.966 A:middle
have been looking at.

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:33.476 A:middle
Now you may notice that these

00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.756 A:middle
are largely the same as on iOS.

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:38.206 A:middle
I want to call out one

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:39.016 A:middle
difference, and that's the

00:10:39.016 --> 00:10:40.876 A:middle
Locations Services Info.plist

00:10:40.876 --> 00:10:41.126 A:middle
key.

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:44.956 A:middle
This key is actually deprecated

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:47.586 A:middle
on iOS, but I assure you it is

00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:49.696 A:middle
the correct key to use in macOS

00:10:49.926 --> 00:10:50.396 A:middle
Mojave.

00:10:50.986 --> 00:10:54.066 A:middle
So these keys will be required

00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:55.986 A:middle
for apps linked against the

00:10:55.986 --> 00:10:57.226 A:middle
10.14 SDK.

00:10:58.666 --> 00:11:00.666 A:middle
So besides informing the user,
