00:33:59.346 --> 00:34:00.466 A:middle
be taken back to the Archive

00:34:00.466 --> 00:34:02.616 A:middle
pane; and you can see that the

00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:04.596 A:middle
status has switched to

00:34:05.256 --> 00:34:05.496 A:middle
Processing.

00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:07.526 A:middle
When notarization is complete, a

00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:10.856 A:middle
push notification will arrive

00:34:10.856 --> 00:34:12.596 A:middle
and Xcode will notify you that

00:34:12.596 --> 00:34:13.565 A:middle
notarization is done.

00:34:14.806 --> 00:34:16.295 A:middle
Xcode will then automatically

00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:18.235 A:middle
download the ticket, staple it

00:34:18.235 --> 00:34:18.926 A:middle
to your content.

00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:20.315 A:middle
So the next time you go into the

00:34:20.315 --> 00:34:22.196 A:middle
Archive pane and click Export,

00:34:22.496 --> 00:34:23.686 A:middle
you'll already have a stapled

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:25.156 A:middle
Developer ID notarized

00:34:25.576 --> 00:34:26.146 A:middle
application.

00:34:26.676 --> 00:34:28.726 A:middle
And when the user launches it

00:34:28.726 --> 00:34:30.255 A:middle
for the first time, they'll see

00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:30.866 A:middle
a new version of the

00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:32.406 A:middle
first-launch dialog that

00:34:32.406 --> 00:34:33.726 A:middle
includes your app's icon.

00:34:34.326 --> 00:34:37.295 A:middle
Now we understand that not

00:34:37.295 --> 00:34:38.485 A:middle
everybody uses Xcode's

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:40.255 A:middle
distribution workflow, although

00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:41.346 A:middle
this Xcode works - dah.

00:34:41.576 --> 00:34:42.846 A:middle
The Xcode workflow is available

00:34:42.846 --> 00:34:43.556 A:middle
today in the preview.

00:34:43.556 --> 00:34:45.306 A:middle
We have also built a set of

00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:46.966 A:middle
command line tools to perform

00:34:46.966 --> 00:34:48.016 A:middle
every step of this so that you

00:34:48.016 --> 00:34:48.916 A:middle
can integrate them with any

00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:49.666 A:middle
custom flows [phonetic] you

00:34:49.666 --> 00:34:49.966 A:middle
have.

00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:52.576 A:middle
And the first step is to upload

00:34:52.576 --> 00:34:53.755 A:middle
a copy for notarization.

00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:57.896 A:middle
Now the notary service accepts

00:34:57.976 --> 00:35:00.176 A:middle
Zip files, installer packages,
