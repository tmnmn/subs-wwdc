00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:00.306 A:middle
automatically grant you access

00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:00.746 A:middle
to the data.

00:27:01.356 --> 00:27:02.726 A:middle
The user is still in control of

00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:03.416 A:middle
the final decision.

00:27:03.966 --> 00:27:07.276 A:middle
So how do we enable this?

00:27:07.396 --> 00:27:09.966 A:middle
Well, from Xcode you can go into

00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:12.296 A:middle
Target setting in the

00:27:12.296 --> 00:27:14.006 A:middle
Tap-ability tab.

00:27:15.096 --> 00:27:16.426 A:middle
There you will find a new hard

00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:18.566 A:middle
and Runtime section, which you

00:27:18.566 --> 00:27:18.976 A:middle
can enable.

00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:21.136 A:middle
We have checkboxes for every

00:27:21.136 --> 00:27:22.346 A:middle
single of the entitlements that

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:22.976 A:middle
are previously described.

00:27:29.686 --> 00:27:31.306 A:middle
And then a few more comportable

00:27:31.306 --> 00:27:32.606 A:middle
[phonetic] using the using the

00:27:32.606 --> 00:27:34.486 A:middle
Command Line interface, then we

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.576 A:middle
can use the new runtime option

00:27:37.016 --> 00:27:37.936 A:middle
in the codesign command.

00:27:38.506 --> 00:27:40.966 A:middle
And in order for you to validate

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:42.146 A:middle
that you have properly enrolled

00:27:42.456 --> 00:27:43.766 A:middle
and opted into this new runtime,

00:27:43.866 --> 00:27:44.806 A:middle
you can use the dash-dash

00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:45.566 A:middle
display option.

00:27:46.096 --> 00:27:48.066 A:middle
And here, the things to look for

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:51.566 A:middle
are the runtime flag as well as

00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:52.976 A:middle
the runtime version.

00:27:57.266 --> 00:27:57.546 A:middle
All right.

00:27:57.856 --> 00:27:58.726 A:middle
Now let's look at the final

00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:00.376 A:middle
piece of that puzzle and talk
