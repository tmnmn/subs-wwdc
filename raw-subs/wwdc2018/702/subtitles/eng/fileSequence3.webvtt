00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.876 A:middle
making security decisions for

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:02.346 A:middle
their self - for themselves.

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:04.726 A:middle
We deliberately captured those

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.556 A:middle
decisions, either via the user

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:09.536 A:middle
intent using the mechanisms like

00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:11.206 A:middle
the open/save dialogs or

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:13.606 A:middle
drag-and-drop operations -- or

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:15.946 A:middle
by a user consent, with more

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.176 A:middle
explicit authorization dialogs

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:20.246 A:middle
or asking the user to make

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:22.296 A:middle
security configuration changes

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:23.336 A:middle
in System Preferences.

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:26.886 A:middle
As such, it's critical for the

00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:28.386 A:middle
operating system to be able to

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.456 A:middle
differentiate between the user

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:32.696 A:middle
actually making these decisions

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.976 A:middle
and software driving the UI on

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:36.416 A:middle
their behalf.

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:39.346 A:middle
In the past we have made a few

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:41.186 A:middle
targeted enhancements to some of

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:43.176 A:middle
the system authorization dialogs

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:43.996 A:middle
to make sure that they can

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:46.446 A:middle
detect and block these synthetic

00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:46.856 A:middle
events.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:49.386 A:middle
But these decision points have

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:51.456 A:middle
become so pervasive across the

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:53.396 A:middle
OS that we need a better model.

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:58.076 A:middle
In macOS Mojave, the system will

00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:00.216 A:middle
only allow UI events to be
