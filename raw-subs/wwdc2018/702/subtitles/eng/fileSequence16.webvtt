00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:03.516 A:middle
The restricted value actually

00:16:03.516 --> 00:16:04.476 A:middle
means that the user cannot

00:16:04.476 --> 00:16:06.606 A:middle
consent, that the hardware --

00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:08.626 A:middle
the camera or microphone -- has

00:16:08.626 --> 00:16:10.416 A:middle
been disabled -- the parental

00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:11.686 A:middle
controls or mobile device

00:16:11.686 --> 00:16:12.136 A:middle
management.

00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:16.496 A:middle
The denied value means the user

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:18.166 A:middle
has previously been prompted,

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:21.306 A:middle
but the user declined to give

00:16:21.306 --> 00:16:21.756 A:middle
consent.

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:23.536 A:middle
They don't want your app to

00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:25.126 A:middle
access that hardware.

00:16:25.666 --> 00:16:28.786 A:middle
And finally, the authorized

00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:30.126 A:middle
value means that the user has

00:16:30.176 --> 00:16:32.016 A:middle
previously been prompted, and

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:33.346 A:middle
they did consent and your app

00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:34.976 A:middle
can access that hardware.

00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:42.606 A:middle
So we believe it's important to

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:43.696 A:middle
prompt in context.

00:16:44.416 --> 00:16:45.286 A:middle
And this is the reason why the

00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:47.396 A:middle
operating system currently

00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:48.656 A:middle
displays the prompts kind of

00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:49.416 A:middle
just in time.

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:50.456 A:middle
At the moment that your app

00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:52.716 A:middle
accesses the microphone of the

00:16:52.716 --> 00:16:55.306 A:middle
camera, the operating system

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:56.496 A:middle
will present a prompt when

00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:57.156 A:middle
necessary.

00:16:57.506 --> 00:16:58.346 A:middle
And we feel that that's the

00:16:58.346 --> 00:17:00.116 A:middle
right time because the user has
