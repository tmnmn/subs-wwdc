00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:00.076 A:middle
packages, and disk images don't

00:30:00.076 --> 00:30:01.446 A:middle
contain any malicious software,

00:30:02.006 --> 00:30:03.316 A:middle
the notary service will issue a

00:30:03.316 --> 00:30:05.346 A:middle
notarization ticket back to your

00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:05.946 A:middle
application.

00:30:07.036 --> 00:30:08.636 A:middle
That ticket can be stapled and

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:09.916 A:middle
then distributed alongside your

00:30:09.916 --> 00:30:10.516 A:middle
application.

00:30:10.816 --> 00:30:12.076 A:middle
And when Gatekeeper launches a

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:13.176 A:middle
notarized app for the first

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:14.776 A:middle
time, it can verify the

00:30:14.776 --> 00:30:16.376 A:middle
notarization and provide a new

00:30:16.376 --> 00:30:17.446 A:middle
first-launch experience.

00:30:18.106 --> 00:30:20.816 A:middle
Now your development workflow

00:30:20.816 --> 00:30:22.386 A:middle
prior to distribution is

00:30:22.386 --> 00:30:22.976 A:middle
completely unchanged.

00:30:27.586 --> 00:30:28.466 A:middle
Now you may have heard, in the

00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:29.636 A:middle
State of the Union, that this

00:30:29.636 --> 00:30:30.966 A:middle
process will be required in the

00:30:30.966 --> 00:30:31.356 A:middle
future.

00:30:31.826 --> 00:30:33.596 A:middle
And while that's true, for now

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:35.096 A:middle
notarization is completely

00:30:35.096 --> 00:30:36.246 A:middle
optional while we roll the

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:37.466 A:middle
service out and listen to

00:30:37.466 --> 00:30:37.886 A:middle
feedback.

00:30:40.256 --> 00:30:41.776 A:middle
Before we move on, I want to

00:30:41.776 --> 00:30:43.386 A:middle
make one important point.

00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:45.586 A:middle
This is not an app review.

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:47.846 A:middle
The notary service is simply

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.126 A:middle
performing a set of security

00:30:49.126 --> 00:30:50.586 A:middle
checks to ensure that your

00:30:50.586 --> 00:30:51.826 A:middle
content can be distributed

00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:52.346 A:middle
safely.

00:30:52.926 --> 00:30:56.416 A:middle
So what does this actually look

00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:57.196 A:middle
like for your development

00:30:57.196 --> 00:30:57.536 A:middle
workflow?

00:30:58.406 --> 00:30:59.686 A:middle
Well here's a high level and

00:30:59.686 --> 00:31:01.176 A:middle
simplified overview of the
