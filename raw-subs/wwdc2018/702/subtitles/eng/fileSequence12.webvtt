00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
your app is accessing their

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:00.906 A:middle
data.

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:04.856 A:middle
So in addition to these

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:07.516 A:middle
prompting categories, macOS

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:10.936 A:middle
Mojave also restricts access to

00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:12.696 A:middle
this privacy-sensitive user data

00:12:12.696 --> 00:12:12.976 A:middle
as well.

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:21.536 A:middle
So the operating system will not

00:12:21.536 --> 00:12:24.006 A:middle
prompt for authorization to

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:25.396 A:middle
access this data via the file

00:12:25.436 --> 00:12:25.766 A:middle
system.

00:12:26.376 --> 00:12:28.236 A:middle
Only the respective system apps

00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:30.566 A:middle
or services have access to this

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:33.066 A:middle
data plus any apps that the user

00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:35.186 A:middle
has preauthorized for system

00:12:35.186 --> 00:12:36.246 A:middle
application data via the

00:12:36.286 --> 00:12:37.586 A:middle
Security and Privacy Preference

00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.076 A:middle
pane that we just saw.

00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:43.056 A:middle
In addition, authorization may

00:12:43.056 --> 00:12:45.276 A:middle
be preconfigured via MDM

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:45.886 A:middle
enrollment.

00:12:47.696 --> 00:12:49.946 A:middle
Another way that this data can

00:12:49.946 --> 00:12:53.066 A:middle
be accessed is via scripting.

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:55.666 A:middle
So Mail, Messages, and Safari

00:12:55.836 --> 00:12:57.376 A:middle
are all scriptable, exposing

00:12:57.426 --> 00:12:58.306 A:middle
some of their functionalities

00:12:58.306 --> 00:12:59.536 A:middle
automation by other apps.
