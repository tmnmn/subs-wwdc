00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:00.776 A:middle
But initiating capture requires

00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:01.726 A:middle
user authorization.

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:04.706 A:middle
And this applies to all devices

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:05.736 A:middle
supported by the built-in

00:15:05.736 --> 00:15:06.176 A:middle
drivers.

00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:13.946 A:middle
Now your app can query the

00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:15.316 A:middle
authorization status.

00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:18.526 A:middle
And this is useful if you'd like

00:15:18.526 --> 00:15:20.086 A:middle
your app's user experience to

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.386 A:middle
reflect user's previous

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:22.276 A:middle
decisions.

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:24.906 A:middle
And this API provided by

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:27.036 A:middle
AVFoundation is the same as on

00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:27.226 A:middle
iOS.

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:29.956 A:middle
And what's interesting is it

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:31.366 A:middle
doesn't just return a simple

00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:32.596 A:middle
Boolean yes/no.

00:15:33.456 --> 00:15:34.416 A:middle
It actually returns an

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.006 A:middle
enumeration of four possible

00:15:36.006 --> 00:15:36.456 A:middle
values.

00:15:36.676 --> 00:15:39.196 A:middle
And I'd like to drill down on

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:40.576 A:middle
those because I think these are

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:41.116 A:middle
relevant.

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:44.166 A:middle
The first one, notDetermined,

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:45.456 A:middle
means that the user has not

00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:47.376 A:middle
previously been consented for

00:15:47.376 --> 00:15:49.016 A:middle
your app to access the camera or

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:49.636 A:middle
microphone.

00:15:51.256 --> 00:15:53.166 A:middle
So should your app try to access

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.636 A:middle
that hardware, the operating

00:15:55.636 --> 00:15:56.796 A:middle
system will display a prompt at

00:15:56.796 --> 00:15:56.976 A:middle
that time.
