00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:01.766 A:middle
denied access, the operating

00:18:01.766 --> 00:18:02.806 A:middle
system already knows that answer

00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:04.706 A:middle
and can immediately invoke the

00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:05.656 A:middle
block telling you what that

00:18:05.656 --> 00:18:06.166 A:middle
answer is.

00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:09.216 A:middle
Similarly, if the parental

00:18:10.126 --> 00:18:13.836 A:middle
controls or MDM server has made

00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:15.866 A:middle
that hardware unavailable, the

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:17.246 A:middle
callback is immediately invoked

00:18:17.246 --> 00:18:19.516 A:middle
with a Boolean value of fault.

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:24.586 A:middle
But it's also possible that this

00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:26.306 A:middle
callback will be invoked later

00:18:26.966 --> 00:18:29.106 A:middle
-- possibly much later -- as a

00:18:29.106 --> 00:18:30.896 A:middle
prompt is displayed while we are

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:31.956 A:middle
waiting for - and then only when

00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.076 A:middle
the user makes their decision

00:18:34.326 --> 00:18:35.486 A:middle
will this callback actually be

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:35.816 A:middle
invoked.

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:38.446 A:middle
At that time we will know the

00:18:38.446 --> 00:18:39.296 A:middle
Boolean "Yes your app has

00:18:39.296 --> 00:18:39.976 A:middle
access" or "No it doesn't."

00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.626 A:middle
So your app can include purpose

00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:47.976 A:middle
text for both the camera and

00:18:47.976 --> 00:18:48.526 A:middle
microphone.

00:18:49.426 --> 00:18:50.576 A:middle
And as with the other purpose

00:18:50.576 --> 00:18:53.076 A:middle
strings, these are required for

00:18:53.076 --> 00:18:54.626 A:middle
apps linked against the 10.14

00:18:54.786 --> 00:18:58.486 A:middle
SDK, and optional and certainly

00:18:58.486 --> 00:18:59.396 A:middle
encouraged because they are

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:00.596 A:middle
informative for apps linked
