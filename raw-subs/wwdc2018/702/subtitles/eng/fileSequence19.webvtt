00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:00.596 A:middle
informative for apps linked

00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:01.666 A:middle
against earlier SDKs.

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:06.586 A:middle
So to recap: Here is an overview

00:19:06.586 --> 00:19:08.026 A:middle
of all the topics that we just

00:19:08.026 --> 00:19:09.106 A:middle
looked at.

00:19:11.176 --> 00:19:14.346 A:middle
macOS Mojave does not solicit

00:19:14.346 --> 00:19:17.136 A:middle
user approval for access to this

00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:17.646 A:middle
user data.

00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:20.116 A:middle
Only the respective system apps

00:19:20.506 --> 00:19:21.446 A:middle
and apps the user has

00:19:21.446 --> 00:19:22.916 A:middle
preapproved via the Security and

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:24.906 A:middle
Privacy Preference pane, or

00:19:24.906 --> 00:19:26.846 A:middle
preconfigured the parental

00:19:26.846 --> 00:19:29.496 A:middle
controls or MDM are permitted to

00:19:29.496 --> 00:19:30.476 A:middle
access this data.

00:19:31.016 --> 00:19:34.916 A:middle
And here are the categories of

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:36.566 A:middle
user data and devices the apps

00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:38.546 A:middle
may access with user consent.

00:19:39.196 --> 00:19:40.786 A:middle
Now the operating system --

00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:43.096 A:middle
macOS -- presents the

00:19:43.246 --> 00:19:44.896 A:middle
authorization prompt to the user

00:19:45.166 --> 00:19:46.846 A:middle
the first time the app accesses

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:47.526 A:middle
this data.

00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:49.686 A:middle
And then it remembers the user's

00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:50.136 A:middle
decision.

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.536 A:middle
And this is great for users

00:19:51.576 --> 00:19:53.796 A:middle
because then they only see one

00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:55.956 A:middle
prompt per app per piece of

00:19:55.956 --> 00:19:56.166 A:middle
data.

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:57.356 A:middle
They don't get multiple prompts.

00:19:58.246 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
But as a developer, you may
