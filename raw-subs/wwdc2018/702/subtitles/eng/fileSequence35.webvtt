00:34:57.976 --> 00:35:00.176 A:middle
Zip files, installer packages,

00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:01.136 A:middle
and disk images.

00:35:02.156 --> 00:35:03.006 A:middle
So if you have a bare

00:35:03.006 --> 00:35:04.556 A:middle
application, you'll need to zip

00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:05.806 A:middle
it up prior to uploading to the

00:35:05.806 --> 00:35:06.566 A:middle
notary service.

00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:08.416 A:middle
The tool for working with the

00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:09.936 A:middle
notary service is altool.

00:35:10.816 --> 00:35:12.116 A:middle
Here you can see a command line

00:35:12.116 --> 00:35:13.866 A:middle
indication sending the Watch

00:35:13.866 --> 00:35:15.316 A:middle
Grass Grow image up for

00:35:15.316 --> 00:35:16.026 A:middle
notarization.

00:35:17.186 --> 00:35:18.546 A:middle
Note that altool does require

00:35:18.546 --> 00:35:20.206 A:middle
authentication, but you can pass

00:35:20.206 --> 00:35:20.966 A:middle
in your credentials via

00:35:20.966 --> 00:35:22.496 A:middle
Environment Variables or the key

00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:22.756 A:middle
chain.

00:35:24.076 --> 00:35:25.966 A:middle
Once upload is complete, you'll

00:35:25.966 --> 00:35:27.486 A:middle
get a UUID that can be used to

00:35:27.486 --> 00:35:28.816 A:middle
monitor status of processing.

00:35:29.346 --> 00:35:31.616 A:middle
But you can also turn back and

00:35:31.616 --> 00:35:33.276 A:middle
pass the altool to check on the

00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:34.456 A:middle
status of your notarization.

00:35:35.936 --> 00:35:37.426 A:middle
Here we see another command line

00:35:37.426 --> 00:35:39.166 A:middle
indication of altool to just

00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:39.866 A:middle
check the status of

00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:40.506 A:middle
notarization.

00:35:40.586 --> 00:35:42.896 A:middle
And then you can see here that

00:35:42.896 --> 00:35:44.676 A:middle
notarization was complete, was

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:45.266 A:middle
successful.

00:35:45.756 --> 00:35:47.316 A:middle
And importantly, there is a log

00:35:47.316 --> 00:35:48.726 A:middle
file that comes back from the

00:35:48.726 --> 00:35:49.806 A:middle
notarization service.

00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:51.536 A:middle
This is a great place to check

00:35:51.536 --> 00:35:54.136 A:middle
for any warnings, or it tells

00:35:54.136 --> 00:35:55.626 A:middle
you exactly what was included in

00:35:55.626 --> 00:35:56.646 A:middle
your notarization ticket.

00:35:56.936 --> 00:35:57.906 A:middle
So you can make sure that

00:35:57.906 --> 00:35:59.316 A:middle
everything in your package was

00:35:59.316 --> 00:36:00.196 A:middle
notarized properly.
