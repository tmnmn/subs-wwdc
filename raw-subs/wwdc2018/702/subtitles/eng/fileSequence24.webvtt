00:23:59.256 --> 00:24:01.246 A:middle
that are not properly signed or

00:24:01.246 --> 00:24:03.626 A:middle
not signed at all, then you have

00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:05.096 A:middle
to use the second entitlement in

00:24:05.096 --> 00:24:05.456 A:middle
this list.

00:24:06.886 --> 00:24:09.016 A:middle
And finally, if your app needs

00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:10.626 A:middle
the ability to modify its own

00:24:10.626 --> 00:24:11.816 A:middle
code pages at runtime,

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:14.056 A:middle
effectively breaking its own

00:24:14.056 --> 00:24:15.896 A:middle
code signature, then you will

00:24:15.896 --> 00:24:18.616 A:middle
have to use the last entitlement

00:24:18.846 --> 00:24:19.376 A:middle
in the system.

00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:21.766 A:middle
And note that the vast majority

00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:23.496 A:middle
of apps should not need that

00:24:23.496 --> 00:24:24.146 A:middle
functionality.

00:24:24.606 --> 00:24:28.756 A:middle
But we still want it to operate

00:24:28.786 --> 00:24:28.936 A:middle
anyway.

00:24:28.936 --> 00:24:31.686 A:middle
Next, library validation: When

00:24:31.686 --> 00:24:32.986 A:middle
you opt into the new runtime,

00:24:33.536 --> 00:24:35.216 A:middle
the system will enforce the code

00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:37.296 A:middle
signature of every library,

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.546 A:middle
framework, and plug-in that you

00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:41.706 A:middle
dynamically load at runtime, and

00:24:41.706 --> 00:24:44.666 A:middle
by default will enforce that.

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:47.316 A:middle
These modules have - these

00:24:47.316 --> 00:24:48.606 A:middle
objects have to be signed by

00:24:48.606 --> 00:24:49.966 A:middle
Apple and shipping as part of

00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:52.256 A:middle
the OS -- or that they be signed

00:24:52.256 --> 00:24:53.496 A:middle
with the same Team ID as the

00:24:53.496 --> 00:24:55.086 A:middle
main executable that ships with

00:24:55.086 --> 00:24:55.376 A:middle
your app.

00:24:56.306 --> 00:24:57.866 A:middle
If you have a plug-in ecosystem

00:24:57.866 --> 00:24:59.646 A:middle
here and you need the ability to

00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:02.936 A:middle
load objects that are signed by
