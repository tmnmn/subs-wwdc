00:21:58.896 --> 00:22:00.146 A:middle
set of runtime protections that

00:22:00.146 --> 00:22:01.656 A:middle
you can easily adopt within your

00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:02.526 A:middle
app.

00:22:03.486 --> 00:22:05.196 A:middle
It is a new opt-in mechanism

00:22:05.446 --> 00:22:06.556 A:middle
that is available within the

00:22:06.556 --> 00:22:07.946 A:middle
10.14 SDK.

00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:10.716 A:middle
It effectively sets a new

00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:12.816 A:middle
security baseline for your app

00:22:13.276 --> 00:22:14.496 A:middle
by enabling the full set of

00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:15.496 A:middle
runtime protections that the

00:22:15.546 --> 00:22:18.206 A:middle
system provides, and requiring

00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:20.326 A:middle
you - requires you to opt to

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:22.436 A:middle
back into more risky behaviors

00:22:22.436 --> 00:22:22.826 A:middle
or ideas.

00:22:23.436 --> 00:22:26.376 A:middle
It is easily configurable with a

00:22:26.376 --> 00:22:27.516 A:middle
new set of unrestricted

00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:28.146 A:middle
entitlements.

00:22:28.706 --> 00:22:30.656 A:middle
Unrestricted here means that

00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:32.466 A:middle
these entitlements are available

00:22:32.466 --> 00:22:34.266 A:middle
to everybody without any prior

00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:34.666 A:middle
approval.

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:38.326 A:middle
It can be easily configured from

00:22:38.326 --> 00:22:39.616 A:middle
within the Xcode UI.

00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:42.596 A:middle
And then finally, it is fully

00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:44.456 A:middle
backward compatible if you need

00:22:44.456 --> 00:22:45.716 A:middle
to be able to deploy your app to

00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:48.386 A:middle
older releases of macOS and its

00:22:48.386 --> 00:22:48.836 A:middle
version.

00:22:49.336 --> 00:22:51.156 A:middle
So as we add more features to

00:22:51.156 --> 00:22:52.246 A:middle
this one time in the future,

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:53.636 A:middle
apps that have already shipped

00:22:53.886 --> 00:22:54.746 A:middle
will not be impacted.

00:22:55.836 --> 00:22:57.156 A:middle
Now let's see what - let's talk

00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:58.036 A:middle
about these new protections.

00:22:59.236 --> 00:23:02.086 A:middle
First off, code signing: When
