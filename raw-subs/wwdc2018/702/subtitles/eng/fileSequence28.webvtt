00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:00.376 A:middle
piece of that puzzle and talk

00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:01.346 A:middle
about notarized apps.

00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:01.846 A:middle
Garrett?

[ Applause ]

00:28:07.216 --> 00:28:07.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Pierre.

00:28:09.186 --> 00:28:09.786 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:11.516 A:middle
I'm Garrett, and I work on the

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:13.686 A:middle
Trusted Execution Team here at

00:28:14.646 --> 00:28:14.786 A:middle
Apple.

00:28:14.966 --> 00:28:16.596 A:middle
Now my colleague earlier, Kelly,

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:18.476 A:middle
talked about one way we help

00:28:18.476 --> 00:28:19.696 A:middle
protect users from malicious

00:28:19.696 --> 00:28:21.586 A:middle
software by ensuring the user is

00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:22.856 A:middle
always in control of their

00:28:22.856 --> 00:28:23.576 A:middle
private data.

00:28:24.356 --> 00:28:25.436 A:middle
I'd like to talk about another

00:28:25.436 --> 00:28:26.516 A:middle
way that we protect users from

00:28:26.516 --> 00:28:27.256 A:middle
malicious software.

00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:29.956 A:middle
And that's by identifying and

00:28:29.956 --> 00:28:31.406 A:middle
blocking malicious software so

00:28:31.406 --> 00:28:32.246 A:middle
it doesn't have the chance to

00:28:32.246 --> 00:28:32.506 A:middle
run.

00:28:33.126 --> 00:28:35.786 A:middle
Now the Mac App Store is a great

00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:37.396 A:middle
place for users to find and

00:28:37.396 --> 00:28:38.376 A:middle
download new software.

00:28:38.376 --> 00:28:40.226 A:middle
And people can confidently

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:42.146 A:middle
install apps knowing that Apple

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:44.306 A:middle
has taken steps to ensure they

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:45.036 A:middle
are not harmful.

00:28:45.616 --> 00:28:47.936 A:middle
Now the Mac App Store is getting

00:28:47.936 --> 00:28:49.056 A:middle
a lot of attention this year,

00:28:49.376 --> 00:28:50.046 A:middle
and that's great.

00:28:50.046 --> 00:28:51.686 A:middle
But we also understand that some

00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:53.476 A:middle
developers need the flexibility

00:28:53.626 --> 00:28:54.886 A:middle
of the Developer ID program.

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.876 A:middle
Together, Gatekeeper and

00:28:57.876 --> 00:28:59.276 A:middle
Developer ID have done a great

00:28:59.276 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
job of preventing widespread
