00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:01.186 A:middle
A few years ago we introduced a

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.616 A:middle
feature called Systemic Security

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.426 A:middle
Protection to macOS with the

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:06.406 A:middle
goal to increase the protection

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:08.566 A:middle
of the operating system by

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.536 A:middle
making it so that platform

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
binaries are protected from

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.806 A:middle
modification both on disk and at

00:01:15.356 --> 00:01:15.536 A:middle
runtime.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.936 A:middle
This year we are taking it one

00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:20.066 A:middle
step further by enforcing

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.066 A:middle
additional code-sending

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.306 A:middle
requirements on platform

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:22.726 A:middle
binaries.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.866 A:middle
The system will now enforce the

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.356 A:middle
validity of code signatures

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.016 A:middle
throughout the lifetime of

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.766 A:middle
system processes and will

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.726 A:middle
automatically abort any process

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:36.236 A:middle
that deviates from its code

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:38.656 A:middle
signature or that attempts to

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:40.846 A:middle
execute any code that is not

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:41.786 A:middle
properly signed by Apple.

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.956 A:middle
In addition to that, the system

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:47.936 A:middle
will monitor it - the dynamic

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.136 A:middle
loading of any libraries,

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:51.856 A:middle
frameworks, and plug-ins and

00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:53.566 A:middle
enforce that - those objects

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:55.226 A:middle
also be signed by Apple.

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:57.826 A:middle
It's a mechanism that has been

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.246 A:middle
enforced on iOS for several

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:00.656 A:middle
years now, and we are excited to
