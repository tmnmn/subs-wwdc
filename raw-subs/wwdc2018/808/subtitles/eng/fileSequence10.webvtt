00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:01.056 A:middle
time and money by making sure we

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:02.406 A:middle
build the right things before we

00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:08.816 A:middle
write a single line of code.

00:10:09.016 --> 00:10:10.496 A:middle
We also got some new ideas along

00:10:10.496 --> 00:10:11.116 A:middle
the process.

00:10:11.616 --> 00:10:13.216 A:middle
These ideas helped make ToastAR

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:13.766 A:middle
even better.

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:16.366 A:middle
And take it from me, it's pretty

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:16.746 A:middle
amazing.

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:20.506 A:middle
Hopefully when you start working

00:10:20.506 --> 00:10:22.336 A:middle
on your next project, you now

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:25.406 A:middle
have a few new tools when you

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:27.836 A:middle
tackle your next AR app.

00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:28.976 A:middle
Thank you so much.
