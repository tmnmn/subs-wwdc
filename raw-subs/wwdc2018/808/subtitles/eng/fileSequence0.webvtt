&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:23.536 A:middle
Hey everyone.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.916 A:middle
How many of you're interested in

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:26.156 A:middle
AR?

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:28.106 A:middle
All right.

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.326 A:middle
Cool. Now how many of you have

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:31.606 A:middle
an AR app in the App Store

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:31.936 A:middle
already?

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:34.876 A:middle
Okay. A few less.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.726 A:middle
I get it. AR can be pretty

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:38.276 A:middle
intimidating.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.716 A:middle
Well, today we're going to look

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:42.466 A:middle
at a few techniques that we use

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.516 A:middle
which will hopefully help you in

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:45.006 A:middle
two ways.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.246 A:middle
First, they're going to

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.886 A:middle
hopefully help make AR more

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.346 A:middle
approachable and second, we're

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:53.256 A:middle
going to show you how you can

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:55.106 A:middle
save time and money by making

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:56.246 A:middle
sure you build the right things

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.386 A:middle
before you write a single line

00:00:58.496 --> 00:00:59.306 A:middle
of code.
