00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:01.296 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.186 A:middle
If you've seen previous talks by

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:07.766 A:middle
my team here at WWDC, you may

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.896 A:middle
already be familiar with our

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:11.726 A:middle
revolutionary app Toast Modern,

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:14.626 A:middle
the best app for finding and

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.096 A:middle
rating the toast around you.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:17.516 A:middle
I know it's amazing.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:20.436 A:middle
Well, we've been building up our

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:22.976 A:middle
database of toast, and now we've

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:24.836 A:middle
been tasked with adding AR to

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:26.826 A:middle
this app.

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:28.206 A:middle
I'm sure you're all aware that

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:29.586 A:middle
the artisanal toast scene in the

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.146 A:middle
Bay Area it's pretty big right

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:31.416 A:middle
now.

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:35.666 A:middle
Well, today it's going to get a

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.846 A:middle
whole lot bigger.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:42.196 A:middle
Introducing ToastAR, the world's

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:46.036 A:middle
first AR toast recognition and

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:46.896 A:middle
rating app.

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.346 A:middle
I know. Thank you.

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:48.926 A:middle
Thank you.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.776 A:middle
Through the use of computer

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:55.076 A:middle
vision and AR, ToastAR lets you

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:56.556 A:middle
check the ratings on a piece of

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:58.686 A:middle
toast and get this, where it's

00:01:58.686 --> 00:01:59.026 A:middle
from.
