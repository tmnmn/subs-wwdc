00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.566 A:middle
at a future date.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.036 A:middle
Now let's see how this scales,

00:08:03.036 --> 00:08:03.196 A:middle
though.

00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:03.836 A:middle
What happens when there's

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.166 A:middle
multiple pieces of toast in the

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:05.686 A:middle
field of view?

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.636 A:middle
So using the same techniques,

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:09.646 A:middle
we'll try this out too.

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.426 A:middle
Now the problem here is when

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:16.606 A:middle
there's multiple pieces of toast

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:18.966 A:middle
in the field of view, I have no

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.056 A:middle
idea which piece of toast I'm

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:22.416 A:middle
currently interacting with.

00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:24.036 A:middle
Maybe I should try putting an

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:27.266 A:middle
indicator in world space so that

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:28.516 A:middle
I know which piece of toast I'm

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:29.456 A:middle
currently interacting with.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:30.956 A:middle
Well, we can try this out too,

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:31.546 A:middle
quickly.

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:35.756 A:middle
So, again, with some help from

00:08:35.756 --> 00:08:37.176 A:middle
our co-worker and our trusty

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:39.336 A:middle
ruler, we can try this out too.

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.346 A:middle
Print out our design, attach it

00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.936 A:middle
to the ruler, and try this out.

00:08:43.316 --> 00:08:44.796 A:middle
It's the camera app world space.

00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:47.436 A:middle
This seems to help us.

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:48.726 A:middle
We know which piece of toast

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:49.766 A:middle
we're currently interacting

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:50.426 A:middle
with.

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.016 A:middle
So let's put it all together.

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.666 A:middle
Using the techniques we just

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:58.326 A:middle
reviewed, we can put together a

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.136 A:middle
rough demo of our prototype.
