00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.086 A:middle
into Keynote.

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:06.136 A:middle
Third, we're going to animate

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:10.096 A:middle
our labeling, import our design,

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:12.846 A:middle
add a move action, give it an

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.156 A:middle
appropriate duration, and move

00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:16.626 A:middle
it to the desired destination.

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:21.146 A:middle
Now here's the important part.

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:22.356 A:middle
We're going to check the build

00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:24.286 A:middle
order and make sure our video

00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:25.956 A:middle
and our animation begin at the

00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:28.036 A:middle
same time but we're giving the

00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:30.136 A:middle
animation a delay so it's on

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:31.836 A:middle
screen when the toast is in the

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:32.356 A:middle
field of view.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:36.616 A:middle
Finally, we're going to put this

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.296 A:middle
on a device and test it out in

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:38.936 A:middle
context.

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:43.836 A:middle
So we'll put it on a device

00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:45.086 A:middle
using Keynote for iOS.

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.616 A:middle
And we'll test this out in

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:47.136 A:middle
context.

00:07:50.076 --> 00:07:52.326 A:middle
Great. Looks like we could fit

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:53.386 A:middle
all the text we need on this

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:53.676 A:middle
label.

00:07:53.716 --> 00:07:55.896 A:middle
And putting this on screen space

00:07:55.896 --> 00:07:57.446 A:middle
will hopefully make it easier to

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.716 A:middle
expand the scope of this label

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.566 A:middle
at a future date.
