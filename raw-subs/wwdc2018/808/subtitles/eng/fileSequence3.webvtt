00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:03.076 A:middle
First world space.

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:04.976 A:middle
When we talk about world space,

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
we're talking about design

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.886 A:middle
elements in the world around you

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:09.576 A:middle
and your device.

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
And when we talk about screen

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:14.846 A:middle
space, we're talking about these

00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.466 A:middle
elements on the screen of your

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:16.796 A:middle
device.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.216 A:middle
So let's take a look at the

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.376 A:middle
original design we got for

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:22.616 A:middle
ToastAR and work through our

00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:23.206 A:middle
process.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:28.456 A:middle
In this design, we have a label

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.446 A:middle
in world space which shows us

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:32.466 A:middle
where the toast is from and its

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:33.006 A:middle
current rating.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.916 A:middle
Now, you may want to jump in and

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.196 A:middle
start coding this immediately.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.726 A:middle
It looks pretty simple, but

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:40.366 A:middle
instead we're going to save time

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.336 A:middle
and money by making sure we are

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.746 A:middle
building only the right things

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
before we write a single line of

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:46.606 A:middle
code.

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:49.166 A:middle
AR is about the world around

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:49.326 A:middle
you.

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.386 A:middle
So testing out your designs is

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.166 A:middle
difficult through a single still

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.046 A:middle
or even video.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
Physical prototyping, however,

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.446 A:middle
allows us to do this in an

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.516 A:middle
approachable, low-tech and
