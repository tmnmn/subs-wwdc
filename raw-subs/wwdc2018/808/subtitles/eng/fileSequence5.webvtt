00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
Then, just using the camera app,

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:02.756 A:middle
we can test this design out in

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:03.346 A:middle
world space.

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:07.886 A:middle
I know. Revolutionary here,

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:07.976 A:middle
right?

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:13.636 A:middle
When we tried this, we learned

00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:14.796 A:middle
one thing really quickly.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.426 A:middle
These labels, at an angle, are

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.086 A:middle
pretty difficult to read.

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.126 A:middle
So the label is hard to read at

00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:20.646 A:middle
an angle.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:23.266 A:middle
Maybe we should have it always

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:23.976 A:middle
face the camera.

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.226 A:middle
So let's try this out.

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:29.626 A:middle
So with some help from a

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.606 A:middle
co-worker and some extremely

00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:34.096 A:middle
sophisticated hardware, okay,

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:35.836 A:middle
it's a clear ruler but

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:37.076 A:middle
beautiful.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.326 A:middle
We tested this out.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.496 A:middle
And we found that yes, the label

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:42.846 A:middle
is easier to read when it's

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:43.766 A:middle
always facing the camera.

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:46.436 A:middle
Well, this behavior is commonly

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.726 A:middle
referred to as billboarding.

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.256 A:middle
And it seems like it'd be pretty

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.056 A:middle
easy to implement in SceneKit

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:52.916 A:middle
using an SCNBillboardConstraint.

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:55.746 A:middle
But before we start coding this,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.296 A:middle
let's continue to test this

00:05:57.296 --> 00:05:58.866 A:middle
design and make sure we're only

00:05:58.866 --> 00:05:59.726 A:middle
building the right things.
