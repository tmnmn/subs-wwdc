00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:01.866 A:middle
So how does the label work when

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:03.386 A:middle
there's a lot more text or when

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:04.196 A:middle
it's at a distance?

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.456 A:middle
Well, we can try this out pretty

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.706 A:middle
easily too.

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:09.416 A:middle
Again, with the camera app, we

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.636 A:middle
can test this out and we find

00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:12.806 A:middle
that yes, it's a little

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:13.956 A:middle
difficult to read when these

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:14.986 A:middle
labels are at a distance.

00:06:15.456 --> 00:06:16.316 A:middle
Maybe we should bring these

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.416 A:middle
labels on the screen.

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.526 A:middle
So how do we prototype this?

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
Well, we're talking about screen

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:25.566 A:middle
space, and we want to do this

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:25.796 A:middle
quickly.

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:26.996 A:middle
So we're going to go ahead and

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:27.656 A:middle
use Keynote.

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.666 A:middle
First, we're going to record a

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:34.786 A:middle
video of our toast.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:36.136 A:middle
We'll record a slow pan.

00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:38.346 A:middle
And notice that we're going to

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:40.106 A:middle
pause on the toast to give our

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:41.486 A:middle
upcoming animation some time.

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:46.456 A:middle
Next, we're going to bring this

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:47.706 A:middle
into Keynote.

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:50.796 A:middle
So you'll create a custom

00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:52.516 A:middle
document size which matches the

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:53.576 A:middle
device you're eventually going

00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:58.046 A:middle
to put this on and then simply

00:06:58.046 --> 00:06:59.596 A:middle
import your video and bring it

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.086 A:middle
into Keynote.
