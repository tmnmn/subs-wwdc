00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.516 A:middle
approachable, low-tech and

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:02.646 A:middle
highly-iterative manner.

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:05.256 A:middle
So how did we get started here?

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.816 A:middle
Well, we printed out our labels

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.366 A:middle
and stuck them to some

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:10.946 A:middle
toothpicks.

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:13.326 A:middle
I know. I know.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:15.796 A:middle
It may seem odd, but this

00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:17.736 A:middle
low-tech process is going to

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:19.255 A:middle
hopefully help us in three ways.

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.106 A:middle
First, we're going to be testing

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:23.616 A:middle
our designs in context.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:25.776 A:middle
Remember, AR is about the world

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:26.146 A:middle
around you.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:29.256 A:middle
Second, we're going to hopefully

00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:30.656 A:middle
figure out any issues with our

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.586 A:middle
design before we write a single

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.686 A:middle
line of code.

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:37.246 A:middle
And third, through this process,

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.206 A:middle
hopefully we'll get new ideas

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:41.136 A:middle
that will help make ToastAR even

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.116 A:middle
better.

00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:44.646 A:middle
But who even has a printer these

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:45.196 A:middle
days, right?

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:48.656 A:middle
You can even just draw something

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
and cut it out.

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:54.476 A:middle
So now that we have our labels

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:55.896 A:middle
attached to our toothpicks,

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.336 A:middle
well, we stick them in a piece

00:04:57.336 --> 00:04:57.756 A:middle
of toast.

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
Then, just using the camera app,
