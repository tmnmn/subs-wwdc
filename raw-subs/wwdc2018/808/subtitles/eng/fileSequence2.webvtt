00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.106 A:middle
Revolutionary I know.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.136 A:middle
I mean, you're all developers

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
for Apple platforms so you

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.716 A:middle
expect the best APIs and the

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.926 A:middle
best hardware.

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:09.726 A:middle
Why not also expect only the

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:10.606 A:middle
best toast too.

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.246 A:middle
So how did we prototype this

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.996 A:middle
beautiful, revolutionary app?

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.276 A:middle
Well, you may think we used a

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:20.426 A:middle
programming language like Swift

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:24.786 A:middle
or a framework like ARKit or

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:26.376 A:middle
maybe even a sophisticated

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:27.736 A:middle
application such as Unity.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:29.946 A:middle
These are all valid ways to

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:31.796 A:middle
prototype, but they're not the

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:32.516 A:middle
only solution.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.276 A:middle
Sometimes you can use low-tech

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:38.736 A:middle
physical prototyping techniques

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:40.226 A:middle
to work through your design

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.616 A:middle
problems before you write a

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.436 A:middle
single line of code.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.046 A:middle
So today I'm going to show you

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:46.646 A:middle
how you can use just the camera

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:53.026 A:middle
app and the world around you to

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:54.976 A:middle
prototype for AR just like we

00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:55.696 A:middle
did for ToastAR.

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:57.586 A:middle
So before we get started,

00:02:57.586 --> 00:02:58.546 A:middle
there's two terms you should be

00:02:58.546 --> 00:02:59.646 A:middle
familiar with.
