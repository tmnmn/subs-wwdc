&gt;&gt; All right, that is really

01:21:04.046 --> 01:21:04.306 A:middle
stunning.

01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:04.936 A:middle
Thanks, Rav.

01:21:06.066 --> 01:21:08.116 A:middle
So that's Metal 2 in iOS 12 and

01:21:08.116 --> 01:21:10.466 A:middle
macOS Mojave, an easy-to-use,

01:21:10.466 --> 01:21:12.216 A:middle
unified 3D graphics and GPU

01:21:12.216 --> 01:21:14.466 A:middle
compute API with broad support

01:21:14.466 --> 01:21:16.046 A:middle
across all of Apple's products,

01:21:16.146 --> 01:21:18.926 A:middle
including the A11 Bionic and the

01:21:18.926 --> 01:21:20.186 A:middle
Apple-designed GPU.

01:21:21.086 --> 01:21:22.716 A:middle
GPU developer tools integrated

01:21:22.716 --> 01:21:24.206 A:middle
right into Xcode and all-new

01:21:24.206 --> 01:21:25.606 A:middle
features to support the latest

01:21:25.606 --> 01:21:27.016 A:middle
advancements in machine learning

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:28.966 A:middle
training and ray tracing.

01:21:29.376 --> 01:21:30.546 A:middle
There's never been a better time

01:21:30.546 --> 01:21:31.686 A:middle
to move your app to Metal, and

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:32.826 A:middle
we can't wait to see what you'll

01:21:32.856 --> 01:21:33.656 A:middle
create next.

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:34.196 A:middle
Thank you.

01:21:35.276 --> 01:21:37.126 A:middle
And now, I would like to hand it

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:38.786 A:middle
over to Mike Rockwell to talk

01:21:38.786 --> 01:21:40.486 A:middle
about what's the latest news in

01:21:40.486 --> 01:21:40.676 A:middle
AR?

01:21:40.676 --> 01:21:40.876 A:middle
Thanks.

01:21:41.516 --> 01:21:43.706 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:21:44.206 --> 01:21:44.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jeremy.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.786 A:middle
So last year has been an amazing

01:21:49.786 --> 01:21:51.306 A:middle
year for AR at Apple.

01:21:51.896 --> 01:21:53.876 A:middle
With the debut of ARKit at last

01:21:53.876 --> 01:21:57.866 A:middle
WWDC, iOS became the world's

01:21:57.866 --> 01:22:01.186 A:middle
largest AR platform by a lot.
