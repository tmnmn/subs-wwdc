00:55:58.526 --> 00:56:00.196 A:middle
inference requests together and

00:56:00.196 --> 00:56:02.566 A:middle
exploit the full performance of

00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:04.066 A:middle
the CPU and GPU.

00:56:05.076 --> 00:56:06.486 A:middle
Through this technique and

00:56:06.486 --> 00:56:07.866 A:middle
enhancements to the Metal

00:56:07.866 --> 00:56:09.036 A:middle
Performance Shaders underneath,

00:56:09.756 --> 00:56:11.866 A:middle
we now have up to 30%

00:56:11.866 --> 00:56:13.596 A:middle
performance improvement on large

00:56:13.596 --> 00:56:14.846 A:middle
networks like Resnet.

00:56:15.536 --> 00:56:16.826 A:middle
But if you're using a smaller

00:56:16.826 --> 00:56:17.806 A:middle
network like the kind you're

00:56:17.806 --> 00:56:20.316 A:middle
going to be using on iOS, we see

00:56:20.316 --> 00:56:21.796 A:middle
up to four times improvement

00:56:21.876 --> 00:56:22.906 A:middle
when running with MobileNet.

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.536 A:middle
Now we didn't stop there.

00:56:26.566 --> 00:56:27.806 A:middle
We wanted to look at making the

00:56:27.806 --> 00:56:29.706 A:middle
model smaller, so we now support

00:56:29.706 --> 00:56:30.386 A:middle
quantization.

00:56:30.886 --> 00:56:32.806 A:middle
So we can take a model that

00:56:32.806 --> 00:56:35.856 A:middle
previously had shipped in 4.3 --

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:37.866 A:middle
such as this example again from

00:56:37.866 --> 00:56:40.216 A:middle
MobileNet -- and reduce it down

00:56:40.216 --> 00:56:42.756 A:middle
to Int 8, and take its size from

00:56:42.756 --> 00:56:44.566 A:middle
17 megabytes to less than 5.

00:56:45.546 --> 00:56:46.926 A:middle
This is a huge saving for the

00:56:46.926 --> 00:56:48.126 A:middle
models that you bundle with your

00:56:48.126 --> 00:56:48.636 A:middle
applications.

00:56:48.636 --> 00:56:53.676 A:middle
Now you can do further reduction

00:56:54.066 --> 00:56:55.566 A:middle
through features like table

00:56:55.566 --> 00:56:56.646 A:middle
lookup quantization.

00:56:56.726 --> 00:56:58.616 A:middle
And we support many other

00:56:58.616 --> 00:57:01.146 A:middle
features, including support for
