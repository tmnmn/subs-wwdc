00:39:59.686 --> 00:40:00.906 A:middle
have some changes I'd like to

00:40:00.906 --> 00:40:03.236 A:middle
make in one of our source files.

00:40:03.346 --> 00:40:04.756 A:middle
It's our scene view controller

00:40:04.756 --> 00:40:04.946 A:middle
here.

00:40:05.676 --> 00:40:07.166 A:middle
So I'll scroll down in the

00:40:07.166 --> 00:40:08.446 A:middle
editor to the place I'd like to

00:40:08.446 --> 00:40:09.206 A:middle
make changes.

00:40:09.816 --> 00:40:10.996 A:middle
And here we can see on the left

00:40:11.076 --> 00:40:12.716 A:middle
-- just to the left of the line

00:40:12.716 --> 00:40:14.896 A:middle
numbers -- the source control

00:40:14.896 --> 00:40:16.206 A:middle
change bar is indicating there's

00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:17.826 A:middle
some upstream changes a team

00:40:17.826 --> 00:40:18.436 A:middle
member has made.

00:40:19.106 --> 00:40:20.346 A:middle
In fact, if I had already made

00:40:20.346 --> 00:40:21.576 A:middle
the changes to this line, you'd

00:40:21.616 --> 00:40:22.926 A:middle
see the indicator turns red,

00:40:23.276 --> 00:40:24.346 A:middle
highlighting a conflict.

00:40:24.976 --> 00:40:26.626 A:middle
If I put my cursor over the

00:40:26.626 --> 00:40:27.596 A:middle
indicator, you'll see it

00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:28.996 A:middle
highlights the ranges of

00:40:29.036 --> 00:40:30.356 A:middle
characters which have changed

00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:31.166 A:middle
and are in conflict.

00:40:32.106 --> 00:40:33.976 A:middle
And if I click on the indicator,

00:40:34.146 --> 00:40:35.776 A:middle
it brings up an action menu with

00:40:35.776 --> 00:40:36.726 A:middle
both a description of the

00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:38.546 A:middle
changes and some actions I can

00:40:38.546 --> 00:40:40.986 A:middle
take I see my team member has

00:40:40.986 --> 00:40:42.376 A:middle
added more descriptive comments

00:40:42.376 --> 00:40:42.556 A:middle
here.

00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:44.896 A:middle
I think we'll take his change,

00:40:45.246 --> 00:40:46.576 A:middle
so I'll use the action menu to

00:40:46.576 --> 00:40:48.946 A:middle
discard my change, and go up

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.546 A:middle
under the source control menu to

00:40:50.606 --> 00:40:51.656 A:middle
pull his changes in.

00:40:53.046 --> 00:40:55.146 A:middle
So here's his changes -- very

00:40:55.146 --> 00:40:56.216 A:middle
descriptive comments.

00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:58.276 A:middle
I can scroll to the bottom of

00:40:58.276 --> 00:40:59.036 A:middle
the editor, see if there's

00:40:59.036 --> 00:41:00.666 A:middle
anything else I'd like to look
