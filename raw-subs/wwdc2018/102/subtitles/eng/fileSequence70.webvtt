01:09:57.106 --> 01:10:00.886 A:middle
So with Metal's deep and broad

01:10:00.886 --> 01:10:02.416 A:middle
support across all of Apple's

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:04.626 A:middle
desktop and mobile platforms, we

01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:06.106 A:middle
are now deprecating the legacy

01:10:06.106 --> 01:10:08.476 A:middle
OpenGL and OpenCL GPU framework,

01:10:08.476 --> 01:10:10.686 A:middle
starting in macOS Mojave, iOS

01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:12.026 A:middle
12, and tvOS 12.

01:10:12.116 --> 01:10:14.786 A:middle
Now apps using these legacy APIs

01:10:14.786 --> 01:10:15.916 A:middle
will still continue to work in

01:10:15.916 --> 01:10:17.256 A:middle
these releases, but deprecation

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:18.766 A:middle
is a first step as we wind down

01:10:18.766 --> 01:10:19.966 A:middle
legacy technologies.

01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:21.156 A:middle
So if you've not already done

01:10:21.156 --> 01:10:22.256 A:middle
so, you should begin

01:10:22.256 --> 01:10:23.336 A:middle
transitioning your apps to

01:10:23.336 --> 01:10:23.676 A:middle
Metal.

01:10:23.676 --> 01:10:24.806 A:middle
And we'll communicate more

01:10:24.806 --> 01:10:27.186 A:middle
details about this transition in

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:27.786 A:middle
the near future.

01:10:28.716 --> 01:10:29.906 A:middle
Now as you bring your apps to

01:10:29.906 --> 01:10:30.966 A:middle
metal, we are here to help.

01:10:31.296 --> 01:10:33.016 A:middle
The Metal API is dramatically

01:10:33.016 --> 01:10:34.726 A:middle
easier to use and much more

01:10:34.726 --> 01:10:35.856 A:middle
approachable than these other

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:37.246 A:middle
GPU programming APIs.

01:10:37.496 --> 01:10:38.856 A:middle
It contains a familiar, yet

01:10:38.856 --> 01:10:40.766 A:middle
powerful, C++ GPU shading

01:10:40.766 --> 01:10:41.186 A:middle
language.

01:10:41.436 --> 01:10:43.126 A:middle
And we provide a full suite of

01:10:43.126 --> 01:10:44.426 A:middle
advanced debugging and

01:10:44.426 --> 01:10:46.666 A:middle
performance profiling tools for

01:10:46.666 --> 01:10:48.346 A:middle
using Metal, all built right

01:10:48.346 --> 01:10:49.076 A:middle
into Xcode.

01:10:49.076 --> 01:10:51.286 A:middle
We have GPU performance counters

01:10:51.286 --> 01:10:52.456 A:middle
with advanced profiling to

01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:53.746 A:middle
identify your most expensive

01:10:53.746 --> 01:10:55.506 A:middle
lines of shader code and a

01:10:55.506 --> 01:10:57.476 A:middle
visual API debugger for

01:10:57.476 --> 01:10:58.646 A:middle
navigating your Metal function

01:10:58.646 --> 01:11:00.666 A:middle
calls, a Metal System Trace to
