00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:00.626 A:middle
to always push the Mac forward

00:20:00.626 --> 00:20:02.546 A:middle
by extending its capabilities to

00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:03.766 A:middle
take advantage of the latest

00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:04.436 A:middle
technologies.

00:20:05.146 --> 00:20:06.236 A:middle
But as we push the platform

00:20:06.236 --> 00:20:08.096 A:middle
forward, we sometimes have to

00:20:08.096 --> 00:20:09.866 A:middle
deprecate legacy functionality

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:11.886 A:middle
to ensure that we're not holding

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:12.376 A:middle
it back.

00:20:13.476 --> 00:20:14.986 A:middle
Last year, we announced that

00:20:14.986 --> 00:20:16.976 A:middle
High Sierra was the last MacOS

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:19.046 A:middle
release to fully support 32-bit

00:20:19.046 --> 00:20:20.766 A:middle
apps without compromise.

00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:23.276 A:middle
And this year, we're announcing

00:20:23.276 --> 00:20:25.326 A:middle
that MacOS Mojave is the last

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:27.756 A:middle
release to support 32-bit at

00:20:27.756 --> 00:20:28.076 A:middle
all.

00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:30.946 A:middle
So as we remove 32-bit support

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:33.286 A:middle
next year, these 32-bit only

00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:35.256 A:middle
frameworks will also be removed

00:20:35.256 --> 00:20:36.726 A:middle
such as the QuickTime framework

00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:38.796 A:middle
and the Apple Java framework.

00:20:39.336 --> 00:20:42.746 A:middle
Next, let's look at security on

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:43.126 A:middle
the Mac.

00:20:43.696 --> 00:20:45.186 A:middle
Gatekeeper has done a great job

00:20:45.186 --> 00:20:46.576 A:middle
at avoiding large-scale malware

00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:48.456 A:middle
attacks and this year, we want

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.786 A:middle
to push it even further.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.086 A:middle
We're extending user consent,

00:20:52.436 --> 00:20:54.176 A:middle
enhancing run time security and

00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:55.586 A:middle
we're launching a new Notary

00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:56.006 A:middle
Service.

00:20:56.246 --> 00:20:57.536 A:middle
So let's look at these in more

00:20:57.536 --> 00:20:57.966 A:middle
detail.

00:20:59.296 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
As you heard this morning, we're
