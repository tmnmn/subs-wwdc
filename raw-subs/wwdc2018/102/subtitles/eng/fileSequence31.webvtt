00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:00.696 A:middle
and hard to read.

00:31:01.096 --> 00:31:02.546 A:middle
The sidebar is the wrong

00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:04.426 A:middle
material so it's too

00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:05.016 A:middle
translucent.

00:31:05.016 --> 00:31:11.246 A:middle
And in the selected segment in

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:12.906 A:middle
control, we have a white glyph

00:31:13.086 --> 00:31:14.056 A:middle
on a white background.

00:31:15.626 --> 00:31:17.266 A:middle
The good news is these issues

00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:20.426 A:middle
were all easy to fix.

00:31:20.776 --> 00:31:22.426 A:middle
We have simple API that support

00:31:22.426 --> 00:31:23.426 A:middle
all the needs of Dark Mode.

00:31:23.426 --> 00:31:25.536 A:middle
And in fact, most of these have

00:31:25.536 --> 00:31:26.846 A:middle
existed for years and we just

00:31:26.846 --> 00:31:29.916 A:middle
had to augment them a tiny bit.

00:31:29.916 --> 00:31:30.576 A:middle
There's NSColor.

00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:34.376 A:middle
There's Container Views with

00:31:34.376 --> 00:31:35.796 A:middle
background color properties.

00:31:36.926 --> 00:31:38.456 A:middle
There's Visual Effect View in

00:31:38.456 --> 00:31:39.036 A:middle
materials.

00:31:40.606 --> 00:31:42.366 A:middle
There's Template Images and a

00:31:42.366 --> 00:31:44.236 A:middle
new way to colorize your

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:44.476 A:middle
content.

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:48.456 A:middle
So we updated Keynote with these

00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:50.476 A:middle
APIs and this is the result.

00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:51.976 A:middle
It looks great.

00:31:54.696 --> 00:31:55.906 A:middle
These were pretty simple

00:31:55.906 --> 00:31:56.416 A:middle
changes.

00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.436 A:middle
We invite you to try this today.

00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:00.236 A:middle
