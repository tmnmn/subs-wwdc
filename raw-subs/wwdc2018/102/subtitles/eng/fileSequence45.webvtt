00:44:59.386 --> 00:45:01.006 A:middle
Now as Sebastian mentioned

00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:02.626 A:middle
earlier, we are passionate about

00:45:02.626 --> 00:45:04.186 A:middle
giving you great tools to debug

00:45:04.476 --> 00:45:05.696 A:middle
and optimize your apps.

00:45:06.056 --> 00:45:07.556 A:middle
And this year, we focused on the

00:45:07.556 --> 00:45:09.346 A:middle
usability and performance of our

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:09.536 A:middle
tools.

00:45:09.536 --> 00:45:12.456 A:middle
We started with LLDB, our

00:45:12.456 --> 00:45:13.536 A:middle
lower-level debugger.

00:45:13.966 --> 00:45:15.656 A:middle
Which now has faster startup and

00:45:15.656 --> 00:45:16.966 A:middle
more precise access to your

00:45:16.966 --> 00:45:19.146 A:middle
variables in the console and

00:45:19.146 --> 00:45:20.186 A:middle
Xcode's variables view.

00:45:21.676 --> 00:45:23.176 A:middle
Next, we've made downloading

00:45:23.176 --> 00:45:25.246 A:middle
debug symbols five-times faster.

00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:26.496 A:middle
So now it's more like seconds

00:45:26.496 --> 00:45:26.976 A:middle
rather than minutes.

00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:33.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:45:33.646 --> 00:45:34.646 A:middle
We've enhanced our memory

00:45:34.646 --> 00:45:35.966 A:middle
debugging tools to have faster

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.106 A:middle
loading, and saving of

00:45:37.106 --> 00:45:39.176 A:middle
documents, and a new compact

00:45:39.176 --> 00:45:40.646 A:middle
layout to help you visualize

00:45:40.646 --> 00:45:42.286 A:middle
even more of your application at

00:45:42.326 --> 00:45:42.746 A:middle
once.

00:45:43.886 --> 00:45:45.456 A:middle
And earlier this spring, we

00:45:45.456 --> 00:45:47.386 A:middle
introduced energy diagnostic

00:45:47.386 --> 00:45:47.936 A:middle
reports.

00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:49.826 A:middle
They're like crash logs, but for

00:45:49.826 --> 00:45:50.606 A:middle
energy usage.

00:45:51.266 --> 00:45:52.796 A:middle
These reports are automatically

00:45:52.836 --> 00:45:54.656 A:middle
collected on iOS for test flight

00:45:54.656 --> 00:45:57.086 A:middle
in App Store apps and surface

00:45:57.086 --> 00:45:59.106 A:middle
details for foreground and

00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:00.016 A:middle
background usage.
