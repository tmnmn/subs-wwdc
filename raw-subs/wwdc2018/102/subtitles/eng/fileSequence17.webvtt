00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:00.406 A:middle
Now, as I look at this, I think

00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:02.126 A:middle
I see what the problem might be

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:02.626 A:middle
right away.

00:17:02.886 --> 00:17:04.256 A:middle
So every time I go to process

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:05.756 A:middle
data and parse it here, I can

00:17:05.756 --> 00:17:07.336 A:middle
see a corresponding spike in the

00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:08.846 A:middle
CPU use on the main thread.

00:17:08.846 --> 00:17:11.096 A:middle
And to me, that is a bright red

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.376 A:middle
flag that I'm probably parsing

00:17:13.376 --> 00:17:14.886 A:middle
and processing this on the main

00:17:14.886 --> 00:17:15.126 A:middle
thread.

00:17:15.746 --> 00:17:17.326 A:middle
Not a recipe for a smooth UI.

00:17:18.066 --> 00:17:19.876 A:middle
So with just a log statement, a

00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:21.256 A:middle
couple of signposts, you could

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:22.366 A:middle
see I can start to get some

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:23.876 A:middle
really great insight into the

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.236 A:middle
performance of my app.

00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:28.465 A:middle
Now the new tools, they let you

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:29.866 A:middle
do way more than that.

00:17:30.286 --> 00:17:32.516 A:middle
So with Xcode 10, there's a new

00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:34.366 A:middle
template that lets you create a

00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:36.506 A:middle
fully customized Instruments

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:37.296 A:middle
package.

00:17:37.786 --> 00:17:38.836 A:middle
Now, one of my team mates, he's

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.286 A:middle
gone ahead and built one based

00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:41.686 A:middle
on some network, some signposts

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.386 A:middle
that he added to our networking

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:44.006 A:middle
framework.

00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:45.516 A:middle
And I've got the latest version

00:17:45.516 --> 00:17:46.796 A:middle
he sent me here in my downloads.

00:17:47.236 --> 00:17:50.056 A:middle
So let me open that up and when

00:17:50.056 --> 00:17:51.576 A:middle
I do, Instruments offers to

00:17:51.576 --> 00:17:52.446 A:middle
install it for me.

00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:54.376 A:middle
So I'll say install.

00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:56.056 A:middle
And now you'll see, I've got a

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:56.756 A:middle
new template.

00:17:56.756 --> 00:17:57.636 A:middle
Here are my templates.

00:17:57.636 --> 00:17:58.696 A:middle
These are called Solar Systems.

00:17:58.696 --> 00:17:59.866 A:middle
I'm going to double click that.

00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:02.516 A:middle
And then we'll start recording
