00:50:00.006 --> 00:50:01.116 A:middle
In addition to greater

00:50:01.116 --> 00:50:03.656 A:middle
reliability and stability, we

00:50:03.656 --> 00:50:05.316 A:middle
also focused on overall build

00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:05.916 A:middle
performance.

00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:07.936 A:middle
You'll find the build system now

00:50:07.936 --> 00:50:09.906 A:middle
has faster rebuilds, better task

00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:11.976 A:middle
parallelization, and uses less

00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:12.266 A:middle
memory.

00:50:13.126 --> 00:50:14.436 A:middle
And the build system now

00:50:14.436 --> 00:50:16.476 A:middle
includes new richer diagnostics

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:17.946 A:middle
to help you tune your project

00:50:17.986 --> 00:50:19.516 A:middle
configuration to achieve the

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.026 A:middle
best build performance.

00:50:21.446 --> 00:50:23.746 A:middle
Now staying on build performance

00:50:23.746 --> 00:50:24.956 A:middle
for a second, I'd like to talk

00:50:24.956 --> 00:50:26.466 A:middle
up another core component of our

00:50:26.466 --> 00:50:29.396 A:middle
release, Swift 4.2.

00:50:29.766 --> 00:50:31.156 A:middle
Over the last year, we have made

00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:33.016 A:middle
steady improvements to compile

00:50:33.086 --> 00:50:34.786 A:middle
times with Swift projects.

00:50:35.936 --> 00:50:37.126 A:middle
We've sampled a number of open

00:50:37.126 --> 00:50:39.526 A:middle
source iOS applications, and

00:50:39.526 --> 00:50:40.666 A:middle
compared to our previous

00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:42.776 A:middle
release, debug build performance

00:50:42.776 --> 00:50:45.356 A:middle
with Xcode 10 is often twice as

00:50:46.636 --> 00:50:46.996 A:middle
fast.

00:50:46.996 --> 00:50:49.566 A:middle
And for release builds, code

00:50:49.566 --> 00:50:52.316 A:middle
size is up to 30% smaller using

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:54.306 A:middle
the new size optimization, which

00:50:54.306 --> 00:50:55.906 A:middle
is a great win for cellular

00:50:55.906 --> 00:50:56.436 A:middle
downloads.

00:50:57.976 --> 00:51:00.056 A:middle
Now in addition to these, Swift
