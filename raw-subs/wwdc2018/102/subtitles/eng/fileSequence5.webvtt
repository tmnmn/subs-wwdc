00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.266 A:middle
And when we collect users' data

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:03.076 A:middle
or allow a third party to

00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:05.186 A:middle
collect data like photos, we

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:06.376 A:middle
make sure we do so with the

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:07.046 A:middle
user's consent.

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:09.886 A:middle
So let's dive a little bit

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:11.466 A:middle
deeper into transparency and

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:12.266 A:middle
control.

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
You have all seen these alerts

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:16.026 A:middle
when you request access to

00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:18.036 A:middle
location or photos.

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.506 A:middle
And this alert includes a

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:21.326 A:middle
purpose string.

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:23.606 A:middle
Now this is what you provide in

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:25.236 A:middle
order to explain why you're

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:27.446 A:middle
requesting data and how you will

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:28.366 A:middle
use that data.

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:31.036 A:middle
Now a good string includes a

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:32.966 A:middle
clear explanation of what

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.566 A:middle
features it will enable and what

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.236 A:middle
functionality it will improve.

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:42.186 A:middle
Now, the more specific you are

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.206 A:middle
with your users, the more likely

00:05:44.206 --> 00:05:45.936 A:middle
they are to grant you access.

00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:48.876 A:middle
We think it's critically

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:51.276 A:middle
important to understand and for

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:53.016 A:middle
users to understand how their

00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:53.966 A:middle
data will be used.

00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:56.756 A:middle
So app review is paying closer

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.146 A:middle
attention to these purpose

00:05:58.146 --> 00:05:58.426 A:middle
strings.

00:05:59.106 --> 00:06:01.176 A:middle
So if you have a purpose string
