01:12:58.176 --> 01:13:03.376 A:middle
Well, let's zoom in, select a

01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:06.186 A:middle
pixel, and launch the new Shader

01:13:06.186 --> 01:13:08.566 A:middle
Debugger, a powerful interactive

01:13:08.566 --> 01:13:09.956 A:middle
tool to let you visually debug

01:13:09.956 --> 01:13:10.476 A:middle
shaders [inaudible].

01:13:11.206 --> 01:13:14.676 A:middle
In the main editor, I can see my

01:13:14.676 --> 01:13:15.156 A:middle
source code.

01:13:15.816 --> 01:13:17.396 A:middle
And in the sidebar to its right,

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.126 A:middle
I can see variables touched by

01:13:19.256 --> 01:13:21.176 A:middle
each line of code.

01:13:21.176 --> 01:13:22.806 A:middle
Additionally, I can expand any

01:13:22.806 --> 01:13:24.526 A:middle
of these to see more details in

01:13:24.526 --> 01:13:25.316 A:middle
line.

01:13:26.146 --> 01:13:27.876 A:middle
These two views visualize the

01:13:27.876 --> 01:13:29.486 A:middle
area around the selected pixel,

01:13:30.316 --> 01:13:31.906 A:middle
corresponding to the highlighted

01:13:31.906 --> 01:13:34.496 A:middle
region in the frame attachment.

01:13:36.016 --> 01:13:37.986 A:middle
The view on the left visualizes

01:13:37.986 --> 01:13:39.336 A:middle
the variable value.

01:13:39.336 --> 01:13:41.576 A:middle
And the one on the right, the

01:13:41.726 --> 01:13:44.276 A:middle
pixel -- the execution mask.

01:13:44.336 --> 01:13:45.946 A:middle
This indicates which pixels

01:13:45.996 --> 01:13:48.156 A:middle
executed this line of code.

01:13:48.326 --> 01:13:49.766 A:middle
This is an incredibly powerful

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:52.256 A:middle
way to debug the massively

01:13:52.256 --> 01:13:53.296 A:middle
[inaudible] execution of shaders

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:53.756 A:middle
on the GPU.

01:13:53.756 --> 01:13:57.586 A:middle
Now you can see here that the

01:13:57.586 --> 01:13:59.016 A:middle
shape of the execution mask

01:13:59.516 --> 01:14:00.596 A:middle
matches that of the visual
