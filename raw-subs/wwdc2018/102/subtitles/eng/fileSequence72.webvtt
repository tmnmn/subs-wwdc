01:11:59.086 --> 01:12:00.096 A:middle
introducing the Dependency

01:12:00.096 --> 01:12:01.556 A:middle
Viewer, a powerful way to

01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:04.236 A:middle
understand how complex render

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:05.856 A:middle
passes combine to form your

01:12:05.856 --> 01:12:06.166 A:middle
scene.

01:12:07.706 --> 01:12:09.136 A:middle
This gives you a blueprint of

01:12:09.136 --> 01:12:12.296 A:middle
your frame in explaining and

01:12:12.296 --> 01:12:14.276 A:middle
understanding how the complex

01:12:14.276 --> 01:12:15.666 A:middle
render graphs at one application

01:12:15.746 --> 01:12:17.696 A:middle
such as Unity's breathtaking

01:12:17.696 --> 01:12:18.776 A:middle
"Book of the Dead" demo shown

01:12:18.776 --> 01:12:19.406 A:middle
here.

01:12:20.016 --> 01:12:23.556 A:middle
I can zoom out to see more

01:12:24.496 --> 01:12:24.656 A:middle
detail.

01:12:24.816 --> 01:12:26.486 A:middle
Earlier render passes are shown

01:12:26.486 --> 01:12:28.696 A:middle
at the top, with the later

01:12:28.696 --> 01:12:29.856 A:middle
render passes shown at the

01:12:29.856 --> 01:12:30.426 A:middle
bottom.

01:12:31.296 --> 01:12:32.206 A:middle
The lines indicate the

01:12:32.206 --> 01:12:34.176 A:middle
dependencies between passes,

01:12:34.876 --> 01:12:36.136 A:middle
with those for the selected pass

01:12:36.376 --> 01:12:37.426 A:middle
highlighted in blue.

01:12:38.306 --> 01:12:40.096 A:middle
As you can see, with more than

01:12:40.096 --> 01:12:41.616 A:middle
100 render passes, there's

01:12:41.616 --> 01:12:42.896 A:middle
clearly a lot going on in this

01:12:42.896 --> 01:12:43.146 A:middle
scene.

01:12:44.496 --> 01:12:46.516 A:middle
Now as good as this scene looks,

01:12:47.026 --> 01:12:48.276 A:middle
there's always room for more

01:12:48.276 --> 01:12:48.756 A:middle
flair.

01:12:49.256 --> 01:12:50.736 A:middle
So I did an additional render

01:12:50.736 --> 01:12:52.076 A:middle
pass, the lens flare.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.336 A:middle
But as you can see, something

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:55.806 A:middle
didn't [inaudible] quite right

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:57.156 A:middle
-- far, far to green.

01:12:58.176 --> 01:13:03.376 A:middle
Well, let's zoom in, select a
