01:32:59.716 --> 01:33:01.546 A:middle
Metal, a huge step forward on

01:33:01.546 --> 01:33:02.946 A:middle
the Mac with Dark Mode.

01:33:02.946 --> 01:33:04.156 A:middle
I know you all love this.

01:33:04.156 --> 01:33:05.916 A:middle
And it's all backed by great

01:33:05.916 --> 01:33:07.136 A:middle
advances in our development

01:33:07.136 --> 01:33:09.366 A:middle
tools that are really critical

01:33:09.366 --> 01:33:10.526 A:middle
to make the most of these

01:33:10.696 --> 01:33:12.236 A:middle
super-powerful technologies.

01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:15.026 A:middle
And we've also covered how we,

01:33:15.066 --> 01:33:17.156 A:middle
together, can focus on what's

01:33:17.156 --> 01:33:18.966 A:middle
most important to our users.

01:33:20.056 --> 01:33:21.286 A:middle
All these great technologies and

01:33:21.286 --> 01:33:23.216 A:middle
tools are available today as a

01:33:23.216 --> 01:33:25.296 A:middle
developer preview from the WWDC

01:33:25.376 --> 01:33:26.716 A:middle
attendee portal.

01:33:26.716 --> 01:33:27.786 A:middle
Who here has started downloading

01:33:27.786 --> 01:33:27.986 A:middle
them?

01:33:29.286 --> 01:33:29.826 A:middle
Few people?

01:33:29.826 --> 01:33:31.276 A:middle
Okay, you've got to hurry up.

01:33:31.526 --> 01:33:32.666 A:middle
Distribution is limited.

01:33:34.966 --> 01:33:36.556 A:middle
Please make sure to download it

01:33:36.556 --> 01:33:37.456 A:middle
right away.

01:33:37.816 --> 01:33:39.836 A:middle
And also, make the most of your

01:33:39.836 --> 01:33:40.146 A:middle
week.

01:33:40.146 --> 01:33:41.636 A:middle
There are more than 100 sessions

01:33:41.736 --> 01:33:42.906 A:middle
here at the conference that go

01:33:42.906 --> 01:33:44.636 A:middle
deep in all of these topics.

01:33:45.126 --> 01:33:46.336 A:middle
Really, really great sessions.

01:33:46.706 --> 01:33:48.106 A:middle
We also recommend that you make

01:33:48.106 --> 01:33:49.976 A:middle
good use of all of the labs that

01:33:49.976 --> 01:33:51.276 A:middle
we have, because you can get

01:33:51.276 --> 01:33:52.456 A:middle
help from the many Apple

01:33:52.456 --> 01:33:53.986 A:middle
engineers that are here onsite

01:33:54.266 --> 01:33:56.306 A:middle
to answer all of your questions.

01:33:57.206 --> 01:33:58.826 A:middle
So with that, I hope you have a

01:33:58.826 --> 01:33:59.906 A:middle
great conference, and I'm

01:33:59.906 --> 01:34:00.986 A:middle
looking forward to seeing you
