00:27:57.126 --> 00:28:02.066 A:middle
drag it and drop it in my Notes

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:02.686 A:middle
app.

00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:04.426 A:middle
Now in this Note, I have a link

00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:06.406 A:middle
to a news article so I'm going

00:28:06.406 --> 00:28:07.826 A:middle
to click that to open it

00:28:07.826 --> 00:28:09.736 A:middle
directly in News.

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:12.666 A:middle
And we've populated the menu

00:28:12.786 --> 00:28:15.826 A:middle
with items for this application.

00:28:16.126 --> 00:28:17.286 A:middle
So for example, I can go to the

00:28:17.286 --> 00:28:19.036 A:middle
file menu and I can follow this

00:28:19.076 --> 00:28:19.446 A:middle
channel.

00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:22.406 A:middle
And notice how ESPN appears

00:28:22.406 --> 00:28:23.666 A:middle
directly in my transition

00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:24.096 A:middle
sidebar.

00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:26.366 A:middle
Another Mac touch can be seen in

00:28:26.366 --> 00:28:28.136 A:middle
the toolbar here where there's a

00:28:28.136 --> 00:28:29.606 A:middle
red color contribution coming

00:28:29.606 --> 00:28:31.206 A:middle
from the content underneath it.

00:28:31.886 --> 00:28:33.256 A:middle
Now we have controls for the

00:28:33.256 --> 00:28:34.996 A:middle
window in the toolbar including

00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:36.906 A:middle
the share button so I can click

00:28:36.906 --> 00:28:38.266 A:middle
on the share button to show this

00:28:38.266 --> 00:28:39.396 A:middle
article with a friend.

00:28:40.176 --> 00:28:44.186 A:middle
So that's a quick look at UIKit

00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:44.966 A:middle
apps on the Mac.

00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:50.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:51.136 --> 00:28:51.676 A:middle
Now, thank you.

00:28:53.376 --> 00:28:54.686 A:middle
We are continuing to develop

00:28:54.716 --> 00:28:56.266 A:middle
this technology and we are

00:28:56.266 --> 00:28:57.756 A:middle
working to fully vet it before

00:28:57.756 --> 00:28:59.316 A:middle
making it available to you and

00:28:59.316 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
your applications which we are
