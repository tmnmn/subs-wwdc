It was from a user name Ronnie

00:36:00.436 --> 00:36:02.456 A:middle
Bo Bonnie.

00:36:02.456 --> 00:36:03.436 A:middle
This is true -- I'm not making

00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:04.216 A:middle
this up.

00:36:04.556 --> 00:36:05.556 A:middle
But I just wanted to take a

00:36:05.556 --> 00:36:07.436 A:middle
moment and say Ronnie, if you

00:36:07.436 --> 00:36:09.536 A:middle
are out there, no charge.

00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:12.516 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:36:13.516 --> 00:36:15.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:16.366 --> 00:36:17.586 A:middle
Now we also have some other

00:36:17.586 --> 00:36:18.906 A:middle
improvements to our design tools

00:36:18.906 --> 00:36:19.666 A:middle
to share with you today.

00:36:21.286 --> 00:36:23.256 A:middle
Form-based UIs like preferences

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:25.326 A:middle
and inspectors are common in Mac

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:25.996 A:middle
apps.

00:36:26.036 --> 00:36:27.816 A:middle
And Cocoa's NSGridView is the

00:36:27.816 --> 00:36:29.366 A:middle
perfect system for laying them

00:36:30.296 --> 00:36:30.396 A:middle
out.

00:36:30.516 --> 00:36:31.766 A:middle
So we're bringing the power of

00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:33.656 A:middle
NSGridView right into Interface

00:36:33.656 --> 00:36:35.496 A:middle
Builder where you can now design

00:36:35.496 --> 00:36:37.166 A:middle
your column- and row-based UIs

00:36:37.506 --> 00:36:39.126 A:middle
just like working with tables in

00:36:39.126 --> 00:36:39.606 A:middle
a spreadsheet.

00:36:40.636 --> 00:36:41.676 A:middle
Drag-and-drop content [applause]

00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:42.696 A:middle
-- yes.

00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:48.696 A:middle
Yeah, you can clap for that.

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:49.756 A:middle
Spreadsheets can be cool.

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:52.866 A:middle
You can drag-and-drop content,

00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:54.476 A:middle
use contextual actions, and you

00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:56.296 A:middle
get system access to things like

00:36:56.356 --> 00:36:57.436 A:middle
right-to-left layout.

00:36:58.456 --> 00:36:59.476 A:middle
Now when designing your

00:36:59.476 --> 00:37:01.166 A:middle
interfaces, the library is an
