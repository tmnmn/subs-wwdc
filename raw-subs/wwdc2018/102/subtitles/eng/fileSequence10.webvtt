00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:00.316 A:middle
Then you need to label your user

00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
name and password fields.

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:04.056 A:middle
And if the passwords don't meet

00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:06.786 A:middle
your app requirements, now you

00:10:06.786 --> 00:10:10.016 A:middle
can even customize them.

00:10:10.216 --> 00:10:11.886 A:middle
We've also made it easier for

00:10:11.886 --> 00:10:13.256 A:middle
your users to get to their

00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:13.866 A:middle
passwords.

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:16.596 A:middle
They can just ask Siri and once

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:17.806 A:middle
they've authenticated, they're

00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:19.476 A:middle
taken right to their password

00:10:19.476 --> 00:10:19.666 A:middle
list.

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:23.256 A:middle
And on top of that, to help

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.486 A:middle
clear up old password since,

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:27.556 A:middle
we're making it really easy to

00:10:27.556 --> 00:10:29.826 A:middle
tell if any of your passwords

00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:31.516 A:middle
have been reused across your

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:32.456 A:middle
existing accounts.

00:10:33.176 --> 00:10:35.846 A:middle
Your iPhone would flag these

00:10:35.876 --> 00:10:37.456 A:middle
passwords and take you right to

00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:39.136 A:middle
the website where you'll be able

00:10:39.136 --> 00:10:40.766 A:middle
to replace it with a strong

00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:41.326 A:middle
password.

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.796 A:middle
We're also make it easier to

00:10:45.796 --> 00:10:47.076 A:middle
deal with those one-time

00:10:47.076 --> 00:10:49.326 A:middle
passcodes that are texted to you

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.486 A:middle
and your users much more

00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:52.106 A:middle
convenient.

00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:54.886 A:middle
They'll automatically appear

00:10:54.886 --> 00:10:57.176 A:middle
right in the click tap bar and

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:58.736 A:middle
you can fill them in with just a

00:10:58.736 --> 00:10:58.856 A:middle
tap.

00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:05.876 A:middle
