01:21:57.866 --> 01:22:01.186 A:middle
largest AR platform by a lot.

01:22:01.696 --> 01:22:03.146 A:middle
There are hundreds of millions

01:22:03.296 --> 01:22:06.576 A:middle
of AR-enabled iOS devices, and

01:22:06.576 --> 01:22:08.006 A:middle
that number is growing rapidly.

01:22:09.066 --> 01:22:09.966 A:middle
As Craig showed you this

01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:12.336 A:middle
morning, with iOS 12, we're

01:22:12.336 --> 01:22:14.446 A:middle
taking things further by making

01:22:14.446 --> 01:22:16.386 A:middle
AR ubiquitous across the

01:22:16.386 --> 01:22:17.326 A:middle
operating system.

01:22:18.126 --> 01:22:20.696 A:middle
We can now experience AR content

01:22:20.696 --> 01:22:22.946 A:middle
via the new QuickLook Viewer in

01:22:22.946 --> 01:22:26.116 A:middle
Messages, News, Safari, and

01:22:26.116 --> 01:22:26.606 A:middle
more.

01:22:27.456 --> 01:22:29.516 A:middle
To do that, we had to work on

01:22:29.516 --> 01:22:31.246 A:middle
and create a file format that we

01:22:31.296 --> 01:22:32.996 A:middle
optimized for AR.

01:22:32.996 --> 01:22:35.066 A:middle
And we worked with Pixar and

01:22:35.066 --> 01:22:37.836 A:middle
Adobe to create a new mobile AR

01:22:37.836 --> 01:22:39.886 A:middle
format called USDZ.

01:22:40.176 --> 01:22:41.776 A:middle
It's based on the universal

01:22:41.776 --> 01:22:43.616 A:middle
scene description format that's

01:22:43.616 --> 01:22:45.256 A:middle
used across the industry for

01:22:45.256 --> 01:22:46.786 A:middle
professional content creation.

01:22:47.286 --> 01:22:48.726 A:middle
It's optimized for mobile

01:22:48.726 --> 01:22:50.916 A:middle
devices, and it supports Rich 3D

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:52.416 A:middle
assets and animation.

01:22:53.576 --> 01:22:56.946 A:middle
It's incredibly easy to use

01:22:57.256 --> 01:22:57.596 A:middle
USDZ.

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.526 A:middle
On the web, it just takes a

01:22:59.526 --> 01:23:01.596 A:middle
couple of lines of HTML, and
