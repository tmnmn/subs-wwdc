00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:01.206 A:middle
So here I have all of my

00:43:01.206 --> 00:43:02.516 A:middle
IBOutlets defined with week.

00:43:03.006 --> 00:43:04.666 A:middle
If I hold down the option key

00:43:05.066 --> 00:43:06.766 A:middle
and I select all of these in

00:43:06.766 --> 00:43:08.806 A:middle
here [cheering] -- oh, yeah.

00:43:09.226 --> 00:43:10.266 A:middle
Oh, yeah, so let's just convert

00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:12.346 A:middle
those into [applause] unowned.

00:43:12.966 --> 00:43:13.896 A:middle
And just like that, I can make

00:43:13.896 --> 00:43:15.316 A:middle
my changes, and then use the

00:43:15.316 --> 00:43:16.516 A:middle
source control bar to make sure

00:43:16.516 --> 00:43:17.786 A:middle
that I got the changes I want.

00:43:18.546 --> 00:43:19.916 A:middle
So those are some of the great

00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:21.156 A:middle
new editing features you'll find

00:43:21.486 --> 00:43:22.846 A:middle
in Xcode 10.

00:43:23.516 --> 00:43:30.246 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:30.746 --> 00:43:32.066 A:middle
So additions like the source

00:43:32.066 --> 00:43:33.246 A:middle
control change bar and

00:43:33.246 --> 00:43:35.106 A:middle
multi-cursor editing alongside

00:43:35.106 --> 00:43:36.356 A:middle
performance and stability

00:43:36.356 --> 00:43:36.946 A:middle
improvements.

00:43:37.276 --> 00:43:39.156 A:middle
Xcode 10 continues to raise the

00:43:39.156 --> 00:43:40.776 A:middle
bar on our source editing

00:43:40.776 --> 00:43:41.366 A:middle
experience.

00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:43.846 A:middle
Now in addition to the source

00:43:43.846 --> 00:43:45.456 A:middle
control change bar, we are also

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.956 A:middle
extending our source control

00:43:46.956 --> 00:43:47.456 A:middle
integration.

00:43:47.456 --> 00:43:50.426 A:middle
We started first by unifying our

00:43:50.426 --> 00:43:52.286 A:middle
conflict resolution system with

00:43:52.286 --> 00:43:54.106 A:middle
Git, making the results more

00:43:54.106 --> 00:43:56.266 A:middle
accurate, more predictable, and

00:43:56.316 --> 00:43:57.316 A:middle
significantly faster.

00:43:58.466 --> 00:44:00.376 A:middle
Next, we've enhanced the pull
