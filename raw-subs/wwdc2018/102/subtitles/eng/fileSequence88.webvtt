01:27:56.576 --> 01:28:00.706 A:middle
forward, ARKit 2.

01:28:00.706 --> 01:28:03.076 A:middle
ARKit 2 delivers a big set of

01:28:03.076 --> 01:28:06.116 A:middle
advances, including improved

01:28:06.116 --> 01:28:07.946 A:middle
face tracking, with a new

01:28:07.946 --> 01:28:11.106 A:middle
ability to track your gaze and

01:28:11.176 --> 01:28:11.826 A:middle
tongue.

01:28:12.386 --> 01:28:13.786 A:middle
These highly-requested features

01:28:13.786 --> 01:28:14.766 A:middle
allow you to take facial

01:28:14.766 --> 01:28:16.176 A:middle
animation to a new level of

01:28:16.176 --> 01:28:16.726 A:middle
realism.

01:28:17.566 --> 01:28:18.846 A:middle
Turns out that the first thing

01:28:18.846 --> 01:28:20.706 A:middle
kids do when they play with

01:28:20.706 --> 01:28:21.986 A:middle
animojis is stick their tongue

01:28:21.986 --> 01:28:22.226 A:middle
out.

01:28:22.226 --> 01:28:23.276 A:middle
And I think a lot of you do,

01:28:23.276 --> 01:28:23.536 A:middle
too.

01:28:23.536 --> 01:28:24.716 A:middle
That's why we had to put that in

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:24.886 A:middle
there.

01:28:28.366 --> 01:28:29.956 A:middle
To more accurately integrate

01:28:29.956 --> 01:28:31.636 A:middle
objects into a scene, we've

01:28:31.636 --> 01:28:33.346 A:middle
added environment texturing.

01:28:33.726 --> 01:28:36.206 A:middle
ARKit creates textures based on

01:28:36.206 --> 01:28:37.986 A:middle
what the camera sees in the real

01:28:37.986 --> 01:28:40.116 A:middle
world -- notice that the globe

01:28:40.116 --> 01:28:41.346 A:middle
is reflecting the real picture

01:28:41.346 --> 01:28:42.466 A:middle
on the table below.

01:28:43.046 --> 01:28:44.966 A:middle
But what about what the camera

01:28:44.966 --> 01:28:45.706 A:middle
can't see?

01:28:46.346 --> 01:28:47.896 A:middle
While using machine learning, we

01:28:47.896 --> 01:28:49.286 A:middle
trained a neural network on

01:28:49.456 --> 01:28:50.646 A:middle
thousands of typical

01:28:50.646 --> 01:28:51.356 A:middle
environments.

01:28:51.786 --> 01:28:53.826 A:middle
And this enables ARKit to

01:28:53.826 --> 01:28:55.286 A:middle
hallucinate the rest of the

01:28:55.286 --> 01:28:55.876 A:middle
scene.

01:28:56.406 --> 01:28:57.336 A:middle
This means that you'll get

01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:58.906 A:middle
plausible reflections of things

01:28:58.906 --> 01:28:59.846 A:middle
like overhead lighting -- you

01:28:59.846 --> 01:29:01.026 A:middle
can see that in the globe --
