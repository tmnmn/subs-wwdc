can see that in the globe --

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:02.676 A:middle
even though it's never seen the

01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:04.036 A:middle
lighting in the environment at

01:29:04.036 --> 01:29:04.346 A:middle
all.

01:29:06.706 --> 01:29:09.016 A:middle
We've extended the 2D image

01:29:09.016 --> 01:29:11.486 A:middle
detection to provide support for

01:29:11.486 --> 01:29:13.206 A:middle
those -- tracking those images

01:29:13.256 --> 01:29:14.446 A:middle
in three dimensions.

01:29:15.166 --> 01:29:17.246 A:middle
So you can now have 3D objects

01:29:17.306 --> 01:29:18.606 A:middle
that stick to images in the real

01:29:18.606 --> 01:29:19.996 A:middle
world when they're moved around

01:29:20.366 --> 01:29:23.876 A:middle
-- and not only in 2D, but also

01:29:24.236 --> 01:29:24.856 A:middle
in 3D.

01:29:33.836 --> 01:29:37.306 A:middle
ARKit can now detect 3D objects.

01:29:37.796 --> 01:29:39.896 A:middle
You can scan objects via an API,

01:29:40.426 --> 01:29:42.416 A:middle
or a simple developer tool we

01:29:42.416 --> 01:29:46.596 A:middle
provide, and then later, these

01:29:46.596 --> 01:29:48.606 A:middle
maps can be used to recognize

01:29:48.606 --> 01:29:49.786 A:middle
those objects and their

01:29:49.786 --> 01:29:51.756 A:middle
locations and trigger a

01:29:51.756 --> 01:29:53.286 A:middle
contextually-relevant AR

01:29:53.286 --> 01:29:53.976 A:middle
experience.

01:29:59.706 --> 01:30:01.566 A:middle
An incredibly important feature
