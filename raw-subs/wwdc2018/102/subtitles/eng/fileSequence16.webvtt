00:15:58.946 --> 00:16:00.666 A:middle
here, just before I start doing

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:00.966 A:middle
the work.

00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:02.526 A:middle
Then I'm going to add another

00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
signpost right here after I

00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.226 A:middle
finish doing the work.

00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:08.166 A:middle
That's an end-type signpost.

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.056 A:middle
So this is going to create a

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:09.986 A:middle
time interval for me,

00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:11.646 A:middle
automatically calculate the

00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:13.436 A:middle
delta and surface that right up

00:16:13.436 --> 00:16:14.196 A:middle
through instruments.

00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:16.626 A:middle
So let's profile this in

00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:17.956 A:middle
Instruments and see what kind of

00:16:17.956 --> 00:16:18.486 A:middle
data we get.

00:16:19.296 --> 00:16:21.236 A:middle
So I go to Product, select

00:16:21.386 --> 00:16:22.546 A:middle
Profile.

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:24.086 A:middle
Xcode's going to build my app,

00:16:24.876 --> 00:16:26.456 A:middle
launch Instruments and then

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.816 A:middle
we'll start to see, well, we'll

00:16:27.816 --> 00:16:29.446 A:middle
start seeing data stream in

00:16:29.976 --> 00:16:30.066 A:middle
here.

00:16:30.486 --> 00:16:31.506 A:middle
Now right here, you can see the

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:32.536 A:middle
pointsOfInterest track.

00:16:33.156 --> 00:16:34.596 A:middle
So everything that I was logging

00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:35.376 A:middle
with the pointsOfInterest

00:16:35.376 --> 00:16:37.236 A:middle
category, that shows up here so

00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:38.026 A:middle
this is my data.

00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:39.566 A:middle
I want to zoom in.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.816 A:middle
So I'm going to hold on Option

00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:42.026 A:middle
and click and drag so we can get

00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:43.016 A:middle
a closer look.

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:45.086 A:middle
And we can see this little flag

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:46.226 A:middle
right here that says requesting

00:16:46.226 --> 00:16:46.766 A:middle
planet data.

00:16:47.326 --> 00:16:48.876 A:middle
So that's a result of the first

00:16:48.876 --> 00:16:50.136 A:middle
log I added in my code.

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:52.506 A:middle
Then these blue bars right here,

00:16:52.996 --> 00:16:54.746 A:middle
this is where I'm processing and

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:55.376 A:middle
parsing data.

00:16:55.626 --> 00:16:56.866 A:middle
So those are the results of the

00:16:56.866 --> 00:16:58.126 A:middle
signpost I added.

00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:00.406 A:middle
Now, as I look at this, I think
