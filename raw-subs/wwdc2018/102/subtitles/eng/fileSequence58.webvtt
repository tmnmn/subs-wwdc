00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:00.596 A:middle
at those examples.

00:58:01.986 --> 00:58:05.106 A:middle
For Natural Language, you can

00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:06.976 A:middle
now have your own custom Natural

00:58:06.976 --> 00:58:08.816 A:middle
Language model that does text

00:58:08.816 --> 00:58:10.646 A:middle
classification, word tagging,

00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:12.096 A:middle
and of course, we support

00:58:12.096 --> 00:58:12.886 A:middle
multiple languages.

00:58:12.886 --> 00:58:16.576 A:middle
So you could train a model with

00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:18.236 A:middle
very small datasets to do

00:58:18.236 --> 00:58:20.536 A:middle
sentiment analysis such as these

00:58:20.536 --> 00:58:22.636 A:middle
reviews for a movie where you

00:58:22.636 --> 00:58:23.766 A:middle
just train with positive and

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.046 A:middle
negative in strings, and you

00:58:25.046 --> 00:58:26.766 A:middle
build your own custom image --

00:58:26.796 --> 00:58:27.796 A:middle
custom text classifier.

00:58:28.846 --> 00:58:31.786 A:middle
And then you could do the same

00:58:32.266 --> 00:58:34.196 A:middle
for domain analysis, being able

00:58:34.196 --> 00:58:36.226 A:middle
to train a model to understand

00:58:36.226 --> 00:58:37.286 A:middle
whether you're talking about a

00:58:37.286 --> 00:58:38.886 A:middle
hotel or a restaurant in a given

00:58:38.886 --> 00:58:39.316 A:middle
sentence.

00:58:40.026 --> 00:58:43.636 A:middle
Now we think, by far, image

00:58:43.636 --> 00:58:44.986 A:middle
classification will be the most

00:58:45.036 --> 00:58:46.126 A:middle
popular kind of training that

00:58:46.126 --> 00:58:49.256 A:middle
people want to do, and so we've

00:58:49.256 --> 00:58:50.616 A:middle
put a real focus on this.

00:58:51.646 --> 00:58:52.896 A:middle
Traditionally, if you were

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:55.466 A:middle
training a very large model with

00:58:55.466 --> 00:58:56.526 A:middle
what might only be a small

00:58:56.526 --> 00:58:58.086 A:middle
dataset because as a developer

00:58:58.086 --> 00:58:59.246 A:middle
that's all you have access to,

00:58:59.426 --> 00:59:01.096 A:middle
your model wouldn't train well,
