00:41:59.796 --> 00:42:01.146 A:middle
with multi-cursor editing.

[ Applause ]

00:42:08.126 --> 00:42:09.326 A:middle
The key to multi-cursor editing

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:11.306 A:middle
is two fingers, control and

00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:11.506 A:middle
shift.

00:42:11.956 --> 00:42:13.806 A:middle
So I'll hold down those two keys

00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:15.086 A:middle
and just click at the beginning

00:42:15.086 --> 00:42:16.456 A:middle
of each of the other functions.

00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:18.766 A:middle
We'll use range selection, and

00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:20.166 A:middle
we'll just change that to VAR.

00:42:20.606 --> 00:42:22.246 A:middle
We'll change those into colons.

00:42:22.736 --> 00:42:24.786 A:middle
And we're pretty good so far.

00:42:25.896 --> 00:42:27.726 A:middle
Now I happen to know that I've

00:42:27.726 --> 00:42:29.356 A:middle
named my colors in the catalog

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.096 A:middle
the same name as my properties

00:42:31.146 --> 00:42:31.426 A:middle
here.

00:42:32.006 --> 00:42:33.606 A:middle
So we'll just select those names

00:42:33.606 --> 00:42:34.236 A:middle
and copy them.

00:42:34.926 --> 00:42:35.716 A:middle
And now let's go to the

00:42:35.716 --> 00:42:37.136 A:middle
implementation and change that.

00:42:37.836 --> 00:42:39.256 A:middle
So we'll drop three more

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:41.196 A:middle
cursors, and we'll just select

00:42:41.196 --> 00:42:43.506 A:middle
all of this, type in named,

00:42:43.506 --> 00:42:45.876 A:middle
paste in those colors, and we've

00:42:45.876 --> 00:42:46.766 A:middle
made all those changes.

00:42:46.766 --> 00:42:47.916 A:middle
It's like three times faster.

00:42:48.516 --> 00:42:55.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:42:55.516 --> 00:42:56.876 A:middle
Now multi-cursor editing also

00:42:56.876 --> 00:42:58.526 A:middle
works great with column

00:42:58.526 --> 00:42:59.066 A:middle
selection.

00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:01.206 A:middle
So here I have all of my
