stability in SourceKit and

00:38:00.516 --> 00:38:01.856 A:middle
enhance the robustness of our

00:38:01.856 --> 00:38:02.736 A:middle
language integration.

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:04.966 A:middle
So now more of your colorful

00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:06.296 A:middle
comments will stay inside of the

00:38:06.296 --> 00:38:07.876 A:middle
editor rather than being about

00:38:07.876 --> 00:38:07.966 A:middle
it.

[ Applause ]

00:38:16.286 --> 00:38:17.766 A:middle
Co-completion and navigation are

00:38:17.826 --> 00:38:19.646 A:middle
two essential workflows, and

00:38:19.646 --> 00:38:20.686 A:middle
we've improved on both.

00:38:21.596 --> 00:38:23.106 A:middle
Co-completion now provides more

00:38:23.106 --> 00:38:24.896 A:middle
targeted results and limits

00:38:24.896 --> 00:38:26.496 A:middle
completions to high-confidence

00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:27.076 A:middle
matches.

00:38:28.046 --> 00:38:29.466 A:middle
And when navigating, with jump

00:38:29.466 --> 00:38:31.496 A:middle
to definition, the destination

00:38:31.496 --> 00:38:32.956 A:middle
list will now provide contextual

00:38:32.956 --> 00:38:34.676 A:middle
details like file and line

00:38:34.676 --> 00:38:36.276 A:middle
information to help you easily

00:38:36.276 --> 00:38:37.576 A:middle
get to where you need to go.

[ Applause ]

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:44.576 A:middle
And you'll see the same

00:38:44.576 --> 00:38:46.096 A:middle
contextual information in the

00:38:46.096 --> 00:38:48.136 A:middle
new callers option in the action

00:38:48.136 --> 00:38:49.976 A:middle
menu, which is a seamless way to

00:38:49.976 --> 00:38:51.646 A:middle
move throughout your projects.

00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:54.756 A:middle
Now last year, we introduced

00:38:54.756 --> 00:38:56.436 A:middle
refactoring for all languages,

00:38:56.506 --> 00:38:57.156 A:middle
including Swift.

00:38:57.156 --> 00:38:59.286 A:middle
And you, the Swift community,

00:38:59.486 --> 00:39:01.126 A:middle
embraced the opportunity and
