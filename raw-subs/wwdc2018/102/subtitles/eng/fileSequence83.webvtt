couple of lines of HTML, and

01:23:01.596 --> 01:23:03.976 A:middle
it's also natively supported in

01:23:03.976 --> 01:23:06.196 A:middle
SceneKit using Model I/O, so you

01:23:06.196 --> 01:23:07.346 A:middle
can easily use it in your

01:23:07.346 --> 01:23:08.236 A:middle
applications.

01:23:09.596 --> 01:23:11.266 A:middle
We've also been working closely

01:23:11.266 --> 01:23:12.736 A:middle
with industry leaders in content

01:23:12.736 --> 01:23:14.116 A:middle
creation tools to provide native

01:23:14.116 --> 01:23:15.366 A:middle
support for USDZ.

01:23:16.406 --> 01:23:17.986 A:middle
And as you heard this morning,

01:23:17.986 --> 01:23:18.986 A:middle
Abhay said this morning that he

01:23:18.986 --> 01:23:20.726 A:middle
had a sneak peek for you about

01:23:20.726 --> 01:23:21.836 A:middle
what they're doing at Adobe.

01:23:21.836 --> 01:23:22.886 A:middle
So I'd like to invite him to the

01:23:22.886 --> 01:23:24.416 A:middle
stage to give that to you right

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:24.666 A:middle
now.

01:23:25.226 --> 01:23:25.676 A:middle
Abhay?

01:23:26.516 --> 01:23:29.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:23:30.046 --> 01:23:30.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

01:23:32.996 --> 01:23:34.226 A:middle
It's great to be back onstage.

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.186 A:middle
So as you heard in this

01:23:36.186 --> 01:23:38.116 A:middle
morning's keynote, Adobe's

01:23:38.116 --> 01:23:40.866 A:middle
Creative Cloud and ARKit will be

01:23:40.866 --> 01:23:42.806 A:middle
able to reimagine and blend the

01:23:42.806 --> 01:23:44.236 A:middle
digital and the physical worlds.

01:23:45.176 --> 01:23:47.496 A:middle
Now this will require a complete

01:23:47.496 --> 01:23:49.566 A:middle
reimagination of new design

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:50.656 A:middle
interaction models.

01:23:52.086 --> 01:23:54.506 A:middle
So earlier today, we announced a

01:23:54.506 --> 01:23:56.546 A:middle
new system for creating AR

01:23:56.546 --> 01:23:58.986 A:middle
experiences called Project Aero

01:23:59.646 --> 01:24:02.286 A:middle
that infused ARKit with the
