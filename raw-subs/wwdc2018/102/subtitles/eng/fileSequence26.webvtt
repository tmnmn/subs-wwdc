00:25:59.376 --> 00:26:01.746 A:middle
great Mac apps.

00:26:01.746 --> 00:26:03.396 A:middle
Of course, AppKit is our primary

00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:04.846 A:middle
native framework and it takes

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:06.846 A:middle
full advantage of all the Mac

00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:07.596 A:middle
has to offer.

00:26:07.936 --> 00:26:09.156 A:middle
And in no way are we

00:26:09.156 --> 00:26:11.066 A:middle
de-emphasizing that.

00:26:11.066 --> 00:26:12.286 A:middle
However, we note that a lot of

00:26:12.286 --> 00:26:14.186 A:middle
you have iOS apps and you don't

00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:15.396 A:middle
have a native Mac experience.

00:26:15.396 --> 00:26:17.306 A:middle
And for these cases, we want you

00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:18.476 A:middle
to -- we want to give you an

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:20.436 A:middle
easy way to bring your apps to

00:26:20.436 --> 00:26:21.226 A:middle
the Mac as well.

00:26:22.346 --> 00:26:24.206 A:middle
So how are we doing this?

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:27.016 A:middle
These UIKit apps are running in

00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:28.576 A:middle
a native environment on top of a

00:26:28.576 --> 00:26:29.026 A:middle
native stack.

00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:30.856 A:middle
And if you look closely, you'll

00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:32.446 A:middle
see that the stack below the

00:26:32.446 --> 00:26:34.206 A:middle
UIKit app has a lot in common

00:26:34.206 --> 00:26:35.416 A:middle
with the stack below the AppKit

00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:35.976 A:middle
app.

00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:37.616 A:middle
In fact, these environments were

00:26:37.616 --> 00:26:39.336 A:middle
built on a common foundation

00:26:39.596 --> 00:26:40.816 A:middle
which in some cases has drifted

00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
apart over time.

00:26:42.826 --> 00:26:44.696 A:middle
So we're taking this opportunity

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.466 A:middle
to rationalize the substrate

00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:48.546 A:middle
which is great news for you

00:26:48.546 --> 00:26:49.886 A:middle
developers independent of this

00:26:49.886 --> 00:26:51.186 A:middle
technology because it makes it

00:26:51.186 --> 00:26:52.556 A:middle
easier for you to write portable

00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:52.836 A:middle
code.

00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:56.336 A:middle
These apps get all the typical

00:26:56.336 --> 00:26:59.026 A:middle
Mac features and I'd like to

00:26:59.026 --> 00:26:59.976 A:middle
show that to you now.
