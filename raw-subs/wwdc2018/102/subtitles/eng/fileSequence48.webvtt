00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:00.846 A:middle
How awesome, you might ask?

00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:02.776 A:middle
Well, let's see in another demo.

00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:06.386 A:middle
So we're going to go back to our

00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:07.586 A:middle
solar system project one more

00:48:07.586 --> 00:48:07.896 A:middle
time.

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:11.986 A:middle
And here we see the testing log

00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.396 A:middle
for our Mac tests that we ran

00:48:13.396 --> 00:48:13.826 A:middle
before.

00:48:14.406 --> 00:48:15.866 A:middle
Took about 14 seconds.

00:48:16.986 --> 00:48:18.016 A:middle
Let's run it with parallel

00:48:18.016 --> 00:48:19.206 A:middle
testing now.

00:48:19.416 --> 00:48:20.276 A:middle
I'll click and hold on the

00:48:20.276 --> 00:48:21.936 A:middle
toolbar and select the test

00:48:21.936 --> 00:48:22.416 A:middle
action.

00:48:23.016 --> 00:48:23.916 A:middle
And we'll bring up the scheme

00:48:23.916 --> 00:48:24.216 A:middle
sheet.

00:48:25.696 --> 00:48:27.266 A:middle
In the options, I'll just click

00:48:27.316 --> 00:48:29.246 A:middle
execute in parallel and click

00:48:29.246 --> 00:48:31.236 A:middle
test, and we're going to build

00:48:31.236 --> 00:48:32.386 A:middle
our tests for parallelization.

00:48:32.386 --> 00:48:33.676 A:middle
And if you watch the doc in the

00:48:33.676 --> 00:48:35.246 A:middle
lower right, you'll see that we

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:37.076 A:middle
launch the tests, we now launch

00:48:37.076 --> 00:48:38.596 A:middle
many different processes -- this

00:48:38.596 --> 00:48:39.786 A:middle
is one for each of our test

00:48:39.866 --> 00:48:41.246 A:middle
suites -- and collect the

00:48:41.246 --> 00:48:41.746 A:middle
results.

00:48:42.996 --> 00:48:44.116 A:middle
And if we look at our testing

00:48:44.116 --> 00:48:45.966 A:middle
log, it finished almost four

00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:46.646 A:middle
times faster.

00:48:47.516 --> 00:48:53.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:48:54.176 --> 00:48:55.376 A:middle
So where parallel testing works

00:48:55.376 --> 00:48:57.376 A:middle
great for unit tests, it works

00:48:57.486 --> 00:48:58.546 A:middle
awesomely for UI tests.

00:48:59.786 --> 00:49:01.986 A:middle
So I will select the iOS version
