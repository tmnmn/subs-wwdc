01:13:59.516 --> 01:14:00.596 A:middle
matches that of the visual

01:14:00.596 --> 01:14:02.296 A:middle
aberration, telling me that the

01:14:02.296 --> 01:14:04.656 A:middle
issue exists on this line of

01:14:05.206 --> 01:14:05.426 A:middle
code.

01:14:05.426 --> 01:14:06.386 A:middle
Well, now that I know where the

01:14:06.386 --> 01:14:07.806 A:middle
issue is, I can see what I've

01:14:07.806 --> 01:14:09.456 A:middle
done wrong, using the vector

01:14:09.456 --> 01:14:10.606 A:middle
length of the lens flare rather

01:14:10.606 --> 01:14:12.356 A:middle
than the color of the lens

01:14:12.356 --> 01:14:12.556 A:middle
flare.

01:14:12.556 --> 01:14:13.976 A:middle
That will be easy to fix.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.916 A:middle
I can now hit the update shaders

01:14:18.916 --> 01:14:20.576 A:middle
button to quickly apply the fix,

01:14:20.716 --> 01:14:22.386 A:middle
recompiling the shader and

01:14:22.386 --> 01:14:23.836 A:middle
deploying it to the GPU.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.876 A:middle
And here we can see that my lens

01:14:26.876 --> 01:14:28.266 A:middle
flare is fixed, and the scene

01:14:28.266 --> 01:14:28.776 A:middle
looks cool.

01:14:29.516 --> 01:14:36.246 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:14:36.746 --> 01:14:37.936 A:middle
So that's the new Dependency

01:14:37.936 --> 01:14:39.946 A:middle
Viewer and GP Shader Debugger in

01:14:39.946 --> 01:14:41.626 A:middle
Xcode 10, giving you powerful

01:14:41.626 --> 01:14:42.856 A:middle
new tools to build your Metal

01:14:42.856 --> 01:14:43.416 A:middle
applications.

01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:44.446 A:middle
Jeremy?

01:14:45.276 --> 01:14:47.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, [applause] thank

01:14:47.496 --> 01:14:47.776 A:middle
you, Seth.

01:14:50.806 --> 01:14:52.036 A:middle
So in addition to these amazing

01:14:52.036 --> 01:14:53.396 A:middle
new tools, we're continuing to

01:14:53.396 --> 01:14:55.266 A:middle
advance Metal with a fantastic

01:14:55.266 --> 01:14:57.276 A:middle
set of new features in iOS 12

01:14:57.276 --> 01:14:58.606 A:middle
and macOS Mojave.

01:14:58.606 --> 01:14:59.866 A:middle
Now I'm going to highlight just

01:14:59.866 --> 01:15:00.856 A:middle
three of them today --
