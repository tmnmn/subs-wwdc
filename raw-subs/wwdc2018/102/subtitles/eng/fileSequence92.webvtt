You can play with it and modify

01:32:00.496 --> 01:32:01.256 A:middle
it as you like.

01:32:01.256 --> 01:32:02.056 A:middle
We can't wait to see the

01:32:02.056 --> 01:32:03.086 A:middle
creative things you'll do with

01:32:03.086 --> 01:32:03.646 A:middle
SwiftShot.

01:32:05.046 --> 01:32:08.376 A:middle
So that is ARKit 2, improved

01:32:08.376 --> 01:32:10.616 A:middle
face tracking, environment

01:32:10.616 --> 01:32:13.186 A:middle
texturing, image detection and

01:32:13.186 --> 01:32:15.696 A:middle
tracking, 3D object detection,

01:32:16.146 --> 01:32:18.566 A:middle
and persistent experiences as

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.726 A:middle
well as multi-user experiences.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:23.926 A:middle
That combined with USDZ across

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:26.106 A:middle
the operating system makes iOS

01:32:26.106 --> 01:32:28.766 A:middle
12 by far the most powerful

01:32:28.766 --> 01:32:29.926 A:middle
platform for AR.

01:32:30.326 --> 01:32:31.756 A:middle
And we're really excited to be

01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:33.216 A:middle
giving that to you today, and

01:32:33.216 --> 01:32:34.496 A:middle
can't wait to see what you'll do

01:32:34.496 --> 01:32:34.706 A:middle
with it.

01:32:35.426 --> 01:32:36.546 A:middle
So with that, I'll hand it back

01:32:36.546 --> 01:32:37.176 A:middle
to Sebastian.

01:32:37.416 --> 01:32:37.786 A:middle
Thank you.

01:32:38.516 --> 01:32:42.726 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:32:43.226 --> 01:32:43.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mike.

01:32:45.156 --> 01:32:47.946 A:middle
Wow, I think we've seen a ton of

01:32:47.946 --> 01:32:49.556 A:middle
exciting new technologies today,

01:32:49.556 --> 01:32:50.636 A:middle
and I hope you're really,

01:32:50.636 --> 01:32:51.976 A:middle
really, really excited about

01:32:51.976 --> 01:32:52.216 A:middle
this.

01:32:53.076 --> 01:32:54.716 A:middle
We make it easy to leverage

01:32:54.716 --> 01:32:56.406 A:middle
machine learning, build great

01:32:56.406 --> 01:32:58.456 A:middle
new experiences with ARKit,

01:32:58.456 --> 01:32:59.666 A:middle
high-performance graphics with

01:32:59.716 --> 01:33:01.546 A:middle
Metal, a huge step forward on
