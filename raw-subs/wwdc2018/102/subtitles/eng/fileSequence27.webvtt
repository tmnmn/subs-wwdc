00:27:14.046 --> 00:27:15.466 A:middle
You've seen the new Stocks app

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:17.306 A:middle
for iPad.

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:19.426 A:middle
I'm running a Mac version of

00:27:19.426 --> 00:27:20.486 A:middle
this app built from the same

00:27:20.486 --> 00:27:20.906 A:middle
sources.

00:27:22.046 --> 00:27:23.356 A:middle
Mouse events are mapped to UI

00:27:23.356 --> 00:27:25.336 A:middle
events so I can click on a

00:27:25.336 --> 00:27:27.116 A:middle
ticker symbol in the watchlist

00:27:27.586 --> 00:27:28.636 A:middle
to see more information.

00:27:29.306 --> 00:27:30.896 A:middle
I can move my mouse over the

00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.366 A:middle
interactive chart to see the

00:27:32.366 --> 00:27:34.056 A:middle
price at a point in time and I

00:27:34.056 --> 00:27:35.416 A:middle
can click and drag to see the

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:36.926 A:middle
price change over a period of

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:37.086 A:middle
time.

00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:39.406 A:middle
I'm going to click on an article

00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:40.626 A:middle
to open it right here in app.

00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:42.666 A:middle
Now since this is a Mac window,

00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:44.766 A:middle
I can resize it as I would like

00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:46.386 A:middle
and I can also take it full

00:27:46.386 --> 00:27:46.686 A:middle
screen.

00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:49.816 A:middle
I can navigate using two-finger

00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:51.466 A:middle
scroll which is another example

00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:52.296 A:middle
of event mapping.

00:27:52.516 --> 00:27:54.216 A:middle
And if I want to copy some text,

00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:57.126 A:middle
I can select it, pick it up and

00:27:57.126 --> 00:28:02.066 A:middle
drag it and drop it in my Notes
