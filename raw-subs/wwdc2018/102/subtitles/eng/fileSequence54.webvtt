00:53:59.846 --> 00:54:01.636 A:middle
code can be detected in your

00:54:01.636 --> 00:54:01.886 A:middle
image.

00:54:03.276 --> 00:54:05.476 A:middle
Now in addition to the APIs we

00:54:05.536 --> 00:54:06.906 A:middle
previously provided for depth,

00:54:07.576 --> 00:54:08.876 A:middle
we now support people

00:54:08.876 --> 00:54:10.936 A:middle
segmentation, so you can remove

00:54:10.936 --> 00:54:12.576 A:middle
a person from a photo and

00:54:12.636 --> 00:54:13.296 A:middle
separate them from the

00:54:13.296 --> 00:54:15.736 A:middle
background or substitute in the

00:54:15.736 --> 00:54:16.536 A:middle
background for something a

00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:17.926 A:middle
little different.

00:54:19.926 --> 00:54:21.586 A:middle
For Natural Language, we have a

00:54:21.586 --> 00:54:23.836 A:middle
brand-new, easy-to-use,

00:54:23.836 --> 00:54:24.796 A:middle
Swift-focused API.

00:54:26.876 --> 00:54:28.696 A:middle
So you can take simple sentences

00:54:28.696 --> 00:54:30.846 A:middle
like this one and automatically

00:54:30.846 --> 00:54:32.226 A:middle
identify it as the English

00:54:32.226 --> 00:54:32.676 A:middle
language.

00:54:34.226 --> 00:54:35.596 A:middle
You can tokenize the sentence

00:54:37.116 --> 00:54:38.346 A:middle
and convert it into its speech

00:54:38.386 --> 00:54:40.086 A:middle
parts all with simple API.

00:54:40.336 --> 00:54:43.416 A:middle
And as one other option, you can

00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:45.256 A:middle
do named-entity recognition.

00:54:46.046 --> 00:54:47.596 A:middle
Here, determining that the

00:54:47.596 --> 00:54:49.096 A:middle
sentence is talking about Apple

00:54:49.096 --> 00:54:50.096 A:middle
as the organization and a

00:54:50.096 --> 00:54:51.506 A:middle
location in San Jose.

00:54:51.506 --> 00:54:54.726 A:middle
Now you might think this is easy

00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:56.666 A:middle
in languages like English, but

00:54:56.666 --> 00:54:59.106 A:middle
we support many more, including

00:54:59.516 --> 00:55:01.866 A:middle
French, German, Japanese, and
