00:40:59.036 --> 00:41:00.666 A:middle
anything else I'd like to look

00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:01.096 A:middle
at here.

00:41:01.976 --> 00:41:02.976 A:middle
Here's another new feature of

00:41:02.976 --> 00:41:04.696 A:middle
Xcode 10 -- our editor supports

00:41:04.726 --> 00:41:05.376 A:middle
overscroll now.

00:41:06.516 --> 00:41:11.976 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:12.476 --> 00:41:13.706 A:middle
So going back to the lines of

00:41:13.746 --> 00:41:15.226 A:middle
code I'd like to change, I'd

00:41:15.226 --> 00:41:16.616 A:middle
like to convert these hard-coded

00:41:16.656 --> 00:41:18.716 A:middle
functions into properties that

00:41:18.716 --> 00:41:19.996 A:middle
pull the colors from the asset

00:41:20.026 --> 00:41:20.406 A:middle
catalog.

00:41:21.376 --> 00:41:22.416 A:middle
Now there are three of them that

00:41:22.416 --> 00:41:23.636 A:middle
I'd like to change, and they're

00:41:23.636 --> 00:41:25.546 A:middle
a bit spread out now because of

00:41:25.546 --> 00:41:26.336 A:middle
all these comments.

00:41:27.076 --> 00:41:29.066 A:middle
Well, no matter, with Xcode 10,

00:41:29.066 --> 00:41:30.196 A:middle
we've improved code folding.

00:41:31.066 --> 00:41:32.356 A:middle
Basically, you can now code fold

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:33.206 A:middle
anything you want.

00:41:33.686 --> 00:41:34.856 A:middle
And we've brought back the code

00:41:34.856 --> 00:41:35.636 A:middle
folding ribbon.

00:41:35.756 --> 00:41:36.716 A:middle
So just to the right of the line

00:41:36.716 --> 00:41:37.966 A:middle
numbers, I can click --

00:41:38.516 --> 00:41:42.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:43.876 A:middle
-- to collapse the code away.

00:41:44.326 --> 00:41:45.446 A:middle
And we have this nice, svelte

00:41:45.506 --> 00:41:47.046 A:middle
presentation of the collapsing

00:41:47.856 --> 00:41:47.923 A:middle
now.

00:41:48.546 --> 00:41:50.206 A:middle
Now this is the first function

00:41:50.206 --> 00:41:51.686 A:middle
I'd like to change, and I see

00:41:51.686 --> 00:41:52.916 A:middle
that all of these functions are

00:41:52.916 --> 00:41:54.256 A:middle
very similar, and it would be

00:41:54.256 --> 00:41:55.326 A:middle
great if I could make all of

00:41:55.326 --> 00:41:56.836 A:middle
these changes all at the same

00:41:56.836 --> 00:41:57.176 A:middle
time.

00:41:58.226 --> 00:41:59.456 A:middle
Well, I can do that now, too,

00:41:59.796 --> 00:42:01.146 A:middle
with multi-cursor editing.
