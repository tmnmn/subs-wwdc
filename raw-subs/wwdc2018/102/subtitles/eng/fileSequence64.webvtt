and Natural Language APIs and

01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:02.626 A:middle
the enhancements we've made

01:04:02.626 --> 01:04:05.196 A:middle
there; our improvements with

01:04:05.196 --> 01:04:06.866 A:middle
Core ML 2 with smaller, faster

01:04:06.866 --> 01:04:08.486 A:middle
models and even more

01:04:08.486 --> 01:04:10.526 A:middle
customization; and Create ML,

01:04:10.526 --> 01:04:12.546 A:middle
our brand-new machine learning

01:04:12.546 --> 01:04:16.546 A:middle
training framework for the Mac.

01:04:16.756 --> 01:04:17.746 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about

01:04:17.746 --> 01:04:19.016 A:middle
another area of intelligence

01:04:19.066 --> 01:04:20.046 A:middle
that we've built into the OS,

01:04:20.046 --> 01:04:23.296 A:middle
and that's shortcuts, a powerful

01:04:23.296 --> 01:04:25.106 A:middle
new way for you to expose key

01:04:25.106 --> 01:04:26.196 A:middle
capabilities of your

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.776 A:middle
applications through Siri.

01:04:27.866 --> 01:04:31.176 A:middle
And you can even expose these

01:04:31.176 --> 01:04:34.196 A:middle
key capabilities using voice

01:04:34.196 --> 01:04:34.646 A:middle
commands.

01:04:36.316 --> 01:04:38.606 A:middle
Previously, sections of the OS

01:04:38.606 --> 01:04:40.536 A:middle
that had suggested features and

01:04:40.536 --> 01:04:42.846 A:middle
actions for Apple's software are

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:44.306 A:middle
now accessible to you through

01:04:44.306 --> 01:04:44.856 A:middle
shortcuts.

01:04:46.266 --> 01:04:47.906 A:middle
We do all this prediction on

01:04:47.906 --> 01:04:49.576 A:middle
device using machine learning

01:04:49.856 --> 01:04:50.976 A:middle
that preserves your users'

01:04:51.036 --> 01:04:51.486 A:middle
privacy.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.666 A:middle
So you're probably asking how do

01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:55.526 A:middle
you adopt shortcuts?

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:57.956 A:middle
Well, many of you have already

01:04:57.956 --> 01:05:00.306 A:middle
adopted NSUserActivity for
