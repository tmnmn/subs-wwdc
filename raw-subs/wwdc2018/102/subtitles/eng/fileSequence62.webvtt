01:01:59.366 --> 01:02:00.116 A:middle
training dataset.

01:02:00.546 --> 01:02:01.856 A:middle
But what I'd really like to know

01:02:01.856 --> 01:02:03.586 A:middle
is how it performs on new types

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:05.186 A:middle
of flowers that it hasn't seen.

01:02:05.316 --> 01:02:07.156 A:middle
And I've set some of those aside

01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:09.146 A:middle
here, and I can just drag them

01:02:09.246 --> 01:02:10.796 A:middle
in to let the model begin

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:12.346 A:middle
evaluating on these new ones.

01:02:13.076 --> 01:02:15.266 A:middle
And if I scroll, you can see

01:02:15.456 --> 01:02:16.996 A:middle
what the actual label was for

01:02:16.996 --> 01:02:18.556 A:middle
each type of flower and what the

01:02:18.556 --> 01:02:19.436 A:middle
model predicted.

01:02:20.676 --> 01:02:24.006 A:middle
Now 95% is pretty decent on this

01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:24.486 A:middle
dataset.

01:02:25.236 --> 01:02:26.886 A:middle
So what I'd like to do is add it

01:02:26.886 --> 01:02:27.986 A:middle
into my app.

01:02:27.986 --> 01:02:29.456 A:middle
And you can do so just by

01:02:29.456 --> 01:02:31.406 A:middle
dragging and dropping it.

01:02:34.096 --> 01:02:34.736 A:middle
I'll then add it.

01:02:34.856 --> 01:02:36.616 A:middle
And if we take a look at this

01:02:36.616 --> 01:02:38.926 A:middle
new model, we can see it's only

01:02:39.116 --> 01:02:40.016 A:middle
50 kilobytes.

01:02:40.566 --> 01:02:41.866 A:middle
That's a huge savings.

01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:44.226 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and delete --

01:02:45.516 --> 01:02:52.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:02:52.546 --> 01:02:53.966 A:middle
-- I'll delete the 100-megabyte

01:02:53.966 --> 01:02:55.496 A:middle
model and initialize the new

01:02:55.496 --> 01:02:56.966 A:middle
image classifier.

01:02:58.986 --> 01:03:01.976 A:middle
Now if I rerun the app, it's
