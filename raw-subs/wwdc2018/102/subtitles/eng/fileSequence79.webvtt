01:18:59.016 --> 01:19:01.016 A:middle
And for context, that requires

01:19:01.016 --> 01:19:03.206 A:middle
performing over 6 billion

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:04.066 A:middle
intersection tests.

01:19:04.736 --> 01:19:05.676 A:middle
And as you can see, we need

01:19:05.676 --> 01:19:08.916 A:middle
about 12 seconds to do that on

01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:09.566 A:middle
the CPU.

01:19:09.626 --> 01:19:12.556 A:middle
So let's compare that to using

01:19:12.556 --> 01:19:14.286 A:middle
the new ray -- the new Metal

01:19:14.286 --> 01:19:15.796 A:middle
Ray-Triangle Intersector on the

01:19:15.796 --> 01:19:17.506 A:middle
built-in GPU in the iMac Pro.

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.816 A:middle
And you can immediately see that

01:19:19.816 --> 01:19:21.546 A:middle
it's much faster, and we only

01:19:21.546 --> 01:19:23.926 A:middle
need about 1.3 seconds to do the

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:24.606 A:middle
same amount of work.

01:19:24.986 --> 01:19:26.106 A:middle
It's so good, I'm going to do it

01:19:26.106 --> 01:19:26.256 A:middle
again.

01:19:26.256 --> 01:19:26.646 A:middle
Here we go.

01:19:28.436 --> 01:19:29.266 A:middle
And it's done.

01:19:30.046 --> 01:19:32.306 A:middle
So getting an almost 10-times

01:19:32.336 --> 01:19:33.886 A:middle
performance increase is

01:19:33.886 --> 01:19:34.836 A:middle
fantastic.

01:19:35.356 --> 01:19:36.336 A:middle
But of course, we didn't just

01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:36.816 A:middle
stop there.

01:19:36.816 --> 01:19:39.296 A:middle
As Jeremy noted, ray tracing is

01:19:39.296 --> 01:19:40.916 A:middle
well-suited for parallelization

01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:43.336 A:middle
across multiple GPUs, so I can

01:19:43.336 --> 01:19:44.976 A:middle
enable an external GPU that I

01:19:44.976 --> 01:19:46.556 A:middle
previously attached to this iMac

01:19:46.626 --> 01:19:49.556 A:middle
Pro and get the render time cut

01:19:49.556 --> 01:19:50.006 A:middle
in half.

01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:52.316 A:middle
So you'll note the green line

01:19:52.316 --> 01:19:53.676 A:middle
that we've added to help

01:19:53.796 --> 01:19:55.106 A:middle
visualize how we're splitting

01:19:55.106 --> 01:19:56.326 A:middle
this workload across the two

01:19:56.326 --> 01:19:59.026 A:middle
GPUs, with each GPU rendering

01:19:59.026 --> 01:20:00.776 A:middle
half the frame in this case.
