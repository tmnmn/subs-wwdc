01:10:58.646 --> 01:11:00.666 A:middle
calls, a Metal System Trace to

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:02.226 A:middle
put your Metal commands in the

01:11:02.226 --> 01:11:03.506 A:middle
context of everything else

01:11:03.506 --> 01:11:04.506 A:middle
happening on the system.

01:11:04.996 --> 01:11:05.976 A:middle
And we're really excited to

01:11:05.976 --> 01:11:07.476 A:middle
announce two new powerful tools

01:11:07.516 --> 01:11:08.956 A:middle
this year, a new Metal

01:11:08.956 --> 01:11:10.586 A:middle
Dependency Viewer where you can

01:11:10.586 --> 01:11:11.776 A:middle
investigate your complex,

01:11:11.776 --> 01:11:13.326 A:middle
multipass rendering and command

01:11:13.326 --> 01:11:15.526 A:middle
encoders, and an all-new,

01:11:15.526 --> 01:11:17.666 A:middle
interactive GPU source code

01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:19.306 A:middle
shader debugger where you can

01:11:19.306 --> 01:11:20.806 A:middle
actually explore your Metal code

01:11:20.806 --> 01:11:22.966 A:middle
right down to the pixel level.

01:11:24.036 --> 01:11:25.046 A:middle
Now you have to see these new

01:11:25.046 --> 01:11:26.596 A:middle
tools in action, so I'd like to

01:11:26.596 --> 01:11:27.976 A:middle
invite Seth to give you a

01:11:27.976 --> 01:11:28.756 A:middle
demonstration.

01:11:29.346 --> 01:11:29.556 A:middle
Seth?

01:11:30.516 --> 01:11:35.466 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:11:35.966 --> 01:11:36.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:39.556 A:middle
Xcode's GP debugger is the tool

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:40.566 A:middle
for developing your Metal

01:11:40.566 --> 01:11:41.216 A:middle
applications.

01:11:41.576 --> 01:11:43.306 A:middle
In the Debug Navigator on the

01:11:43.306 --> 01:11:44.646 A:middle
left, you can see all the Metal

01:11:44.646 --> 01:11:45.926 A:middle
API codes and [inaudible] codes

01:11:46.126 --> 01:11:46.906 A:middle
used in your frame.

01:11:46.906 --> 01:11:48.956 A:middle
And on the right, you can see

01:11:48.956 --> 01:11:51.036 A:middle
the results of the selected

01:11:51.036 --> 01:11:51.406 A:middle
[inaudible].

01:11:51.406 --> 01:11:53.186 A:middle
The main editor shows you the --

01:11:53.186 --> 01:11:54.656 A:middle
all the buffers, textures, and

01:11:54.656 --> 01:11:56.196 A:middle
other resources that were used

01:11:56.196 --> 01:11:57.316 A:middle
for that [inaudible].

01:11:57.576 --> 01:11:59.086 A:middle
Well, new in Xcode 10, we're

01:11:59.086 --> 01:12:00.096 A:middle
introducing the Dependency
