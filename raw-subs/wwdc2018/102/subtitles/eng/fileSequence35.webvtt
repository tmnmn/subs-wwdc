00:35:00.226 --> 00:35:02.406 A:middle
Now the application launched in

00:35:02.406 --> 00:35:03.856 A:middle
the dark mode to match my

00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:04.226 A:middle
system.

00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:06.466 A:middle
But while I'm developing, I can

00:35:06.466 --> 00:35:07.556 A:middle
change the appearance.

00:35:08.486 --> 00:35:09.866 A:middle
Down here in the debug bar is a

00:35:09.866 --> 00:35:11.516 A:middle
new appearance toggle that's

00:35:11.516 --> 00:35:13.476 A:middle
also in Touch Bar, and it gives

00:35:13.476 --> 00:35:14.446 A:middle
me access to all the

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:15.146 A:middle
appearances.

00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.366 A:middle
I can select the light mode, the

00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:19.566 A:middle
dark mode, even high-contrast

00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:21.196 A:middle
modes to evaluate accessibility.

00:35:21.966 --> 00:35:23.766 A:middle
So I'll select the light mode.

00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:25.816 A:middle
We'll load those assets, and

00:35:25.816 --> 00:35:27.046 A:middle
there's my application in light

00:35:27.046 --> 00:35:27.446 A:middle
mode as well.

00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.496 A:middle
So very simply, with asset

00:35:30.496 --> 00:35:32.186 A:middle
catalogs, interface builder, and

00:35:32.186 --> 00:35:33.946 A:middle
our debugging tools, it's really

00:35:33.946 --> 00:35:35.176 A:middle
easy to make your apps look

00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:36.566 A:middle
great in Dark Mode, too.

00:35:37.516 --> 00:35:45.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:46.066 --> 00:35:47.796 A:middle
Now I know many of you have

00:35:47.796 --> 00:35:49.456 A:middle
wanted a dark mode appearance in

00:35:49.566 --> 00:35:50.646 A:middle
Xcode for a long time.

00:35:51.396 --> 00:35:52.616 A:middle
It's been one of our most

00:35:52.616 --> 00:35:54.076 A:middle
popular requests.

00:35:54.076 --> 00:35:55.296 A:middle
In fact, just a couple weeks

00:35:55.296 --> 00:35:56.686 A:middle
ago, there was a posting in the

00:35:56.686 --> 00:35:58.596 A:middle
App Store about this feature.

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:00.436 A:middle
It was from a user name Ronnie
