00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:01.036 A:middle
requested a way to extend the

00:22:01.146 --> 00:22:02.846 A:middle
zip protections to your own

00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:03.146 A:middle
apps.

00:22:03.886 --> 00:22:05.896 A:middle
And our new enhanced run times,

00:22:05.936 --> 00:22:07.446 A:middle
there's a new security baseline

00:22:07.736 --> 00:22:09.466 A:middle
that requires risky capabilities

00:22:09.826 --> 00:22:10.726 A:middle
to be opted in.

00:22:11.376 --> 00:22:12.456 A:middle
So beyond strong code

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.656 A:middle
validation, if for example also

00:22:14.656 --> 00:22:16.056 A:middle
protects your apps from code

00:22:16.056 --> 00:22:16.606 A:middle
injection.

00:22:17.526 --> 00:22:18.826 A:middle
The enhanced run time is fully

00:22:18.826 --> 00:22:19.906 A:middle
backwards compatible.

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:21.816 A:middle
It's opt in through a simple

00:22:21.896 --> 00:22:23.176 A:middle
switch in Xcode.

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:25.876 A:middle
And finally, we're introducing

00:22:25.876 --> 00:22:28.446 A:middle
the concept of notarized apps.

00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:30.416 A:middle
This is an extension to the

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:32.036 A:middle
Developer ID program for apps

00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:33.706 A:middle
that are distributed outside of

00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:34.596 A:middle
the Mac App Store.

00:22:34.596 --> 00:22:35.896 A:middle
And it has two main goals.

00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:38.266 A:middle
The first is to detect malware

00:22:38.266 --> 00:22:40.356 A:middle
even faster than today before it

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:41.746 A:middle
gets distributed to our users.

00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:43.736 A:middle
And second, provide a

00:22:43.826 --> 00:22:45.026 A:middle
finer-grained revocation

00:22:45.026 --> 00:22:46.846 A:middle
capability so that we can revoke

00:22:46.846 --> 00:22:48.256 A:middle
a specific version of a

00:22:48.256 --> 00:22:50.246 A:middle
compromised app as opposed to

00:22:50.246 --> 00:22:52.326 A:middle
revoking the entire signing

00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:52.946 A:middle
certificate.

00:22:53.786 --> 00:22:54.816 A:middle
Now here's how it works.

00:22:55.316 --> 00:22:56.846 A:middle
You develop the bug and build

00:22:56.846 --> 00:22:57.866 A:middle
your app as before.

00:22:57.866 --> 00:22:59.126 A:middle
And you sign it with your

00:22:59.126 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
Developer ID Certificate.
