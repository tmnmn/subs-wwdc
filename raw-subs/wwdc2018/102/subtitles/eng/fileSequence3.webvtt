important to our users and we

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:02.396 A:middle
deliver these great experiences.

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:04.966 A:middle
Now we think technology is most

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:06.646 A:middle
powerful when it empowers

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:07.576 A:middle
everyone.

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:10.116 A:middle
And so we work to make every

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:12.636 A:middle
Apple product accessible from

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:13.456 A:middle
the very start.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:15.826 A:middle
We provide great capabilities

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:18.026 A:middle
that make our platforms and all

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:19.816 A:middle
of your apps accessible and we

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:21.166 A:middle
want to encourage you to take,

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.496 A:middle
keep taking advantage of these

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.316 A:middle
because it's really important to

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:24.996 A:middle
those users.

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:28.166 A:middle
Now, our users also entrust us

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.786 A:middle
with their most precious data.

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:31.676 A:middle
And so at Apple, we think deeply

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:33.096 A:middle
about privacy and security.

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:35.216 A:middle
And I'd like to invite Katie up

00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:36.756 A:middle
on stage to tell you more about

00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:36.846 A:middle
this.

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:36.976 A:middle
Katie?

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:46.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sebastian.

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:49.176 A:middle
When we think about privacy, we

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:51.066 A:middle
think about how to build privacy

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:52.236 A:middle
into all their products and

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:52.646 A:middle
services.

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:54.376 A:middle
And there could be a lot of

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:55.586 A:middle
details to think about.

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:57.006 A:middle
But it's important to think of

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:58.836 A:middle
the big picture, trust.

00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:01.776 A:middle
Now it's up to all of us to
