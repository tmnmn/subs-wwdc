00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:02.516 A:middle
And then we'll start recording

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:03.126 A:middle
data again.

00:18:04.136 --> 00:18:05.826 A:middle
Now, just like before, I have

00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:07.136 A:middle
the pointsOfInterest tracked so

00:18:07.136 --> 00:18:08.126 A:middle
that is on the data that I

00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:08.896 A:middle
wanted to see.

00:18:09.436 --> 00:18:11.356 A:middle
But now, I've got much more

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.096 A:middle
detailed information about the

00:18:13.096 --> 00:18:14.486 A:middle
networking request that I'm

00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:15.076 A:middle
making here.

00:18:15.536 --> 00:18:16.506 A:middle
So again, let me zoom in so we

00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:16.976 A:middle
can get a closer look.

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:24.136 A:middle
Now, this custom Instruments

00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:26.536 A:middle
package here is giving me a

00:18:26.536 --> 00:18:28.706 A:middle
great visualization into how I'm

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.566 A:middle
using this framework.

00:18:31.016 --> 00:18:32.426 A:middle
So it's showing me things like

00:18:32.626 --> 00:18:34.226 A:middle
for example here, how many

00:18:34.226 --> 00:18:35.746 A:middle
network requests am I making on

00:18:35.746 --> 00:18:37.506 A:middle
average every 10th of a second.

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:39.456 A:middle
Then down here, this track is

00:18:39.456 --> 00:18:41.256 A:middle
showing me detailed information

00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:43.096 A:middle
about each and every network

00:18:43.096 --> 00:18:43.536 A:middle
request.

00:18:43.796 --> 00:18:44.726 A:middle
How long did it take?

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:46.326 A:middle
It's even highlighting duplicate

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:47.396 A:middle
requests in red.

00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:48.766 A:middle
So these are places where I'm

00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:50.386 A:middle
asking for the exact same data

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:51.816 A:middle
more than once.

00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:53.066 A:middle
It looks like I'm doing that

00:18:53.146 --> 00:18:55.186 A:middle
maybe even more than 50% of the

00:18:55.186 --> 00:18:55.406 A:middle
time.

00:18:55.666 --> 00:18:56.836 A:middle
So I'm just leaving a ton of

00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:58.056 A:middle
performance on the table and

00:18:58.536 --> 00:18:59.816 A:middle
it's exactly these kinds of

00:18:59.816 --> 00:19:01.796 A:middle
insights that I need to help me
