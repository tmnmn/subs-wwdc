00:50:57.976 --> 00:51:00.056 A:middle
Now in addition to these, Swift

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:02.306 A:middle
also adds a number of additions

00:51:02.306 --> 00:51:04.036 A:middle
and runtime language

00:51:04.036 --> 00:51:04.576 A:middle
improvements.

00:51:05.326 --> 00:51:06.126 A:middle
Some of these are

00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:07.506 A:middle
tongue-twisting APIs like

00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:08.646 A:middle
synthesized hashtable

00:51:08.646 --> 00:51:09.276 A:middle
conformance.

00:51:10.786 --> 00:51:12.436 A:middle
A perfect place to try out these

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:14.906 A:middle
APIs is in Xcode Playgrounds

00:51:15.596 --> 00:51:16.976 A:middle
because Xcode Playgrounds now

00:51:16.976 --> 00:51:18.676 A:middle
include new [inaudible]-like

00:51:18.676 --> 00:51:20.506 A:middle
interaction that allows you to

00:51:20.506 --> 00:51:21.996 A:middle
evaluate new lines of code

00:51:22.316 --> 00:51:23.726 A:middle
without restarting the

00:51:23.726 --> 00:51:24.486 A:middle
Playground session.

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:30.186 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:51:30.686 --> 00:51:31.756 A:middle
Here's a Playground of our solar

00:51:31.756 --> 00:51:32.346 A:middle
system view.

00:51:32.346 --> 00:51:34.216 A:middle
And the new lines of code added

00:51:34.506 --> 00:51:36.466 A:middle
to move to the next planet are

00:51:36.466 --> 00:51:38.616 A:middle
evaluated and return results all

00:51:38.616 --> 00:51:39.386 A:middle
while the Playground continues

00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:39.536 A:middle
to run.

00:51:42.046 --> 00:51:43.896 A:middle
So all of these additions to the

00:51:43.896 --> 00:51:45.546 A:middle
runtime language and tools

00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:47.646 A:middle
continue Swift's great momentum

00:51:48.046 --> 00:51:49.206 A:middle
as part of Xcode 10.

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:52.036 A:middle
And we also have another release

00:51:52.036 --> 00:51:52.796 A:middle
coming up for you in the

00:51:52.796 --> 00:51:55.646 A:middle
language, Swift 5.

00:51:55.986 --> 00:51:57.806 A:middle
The focus of Swift 5 is greater

00:51:57.806 --> 00:51:59.856 A:middle
adoption by delivering Swift as

00:51:59.886 --> 00:52:01.166 A:middle
part of the OS.
