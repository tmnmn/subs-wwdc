Next, we've enhanced the pull

00:44:00.376 --> 00:44:02.146 A:middle
action to support rebase.

00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:03.896 A:middle
So you can replay changes

00:44:03.896 --> 00:44:04.656 A:middle
between branches [applause] --

00:44:04.656 --> 00:44:05.976 A:middle
yes, it's okay to clap for that.

[ Applause ]

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:10.726 A:middle
You can replay changes easily

00:44:10.726 --> 00:44:12.106 A:middle
between branches without the

00:44:12.106 --> 00:44:13.346 A:middle
unnecessary merge commits.

00:44:13.976 --> 00:44:15.786 A:middle
And to keep your connections

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.116 A:middle
secure, Xcode will help you

00:44:17.116 --> 00:44:19.836 A:middle
create SSH keys and upload them

00:44:19.836 --> 00:44:21.326 A:middle
directly to your service

00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:21.786 A:middle
accounts.

[ Applause ]

00:44:27.016 --> 00:44:27.866 A:middle
And this is the perfect

00:44:27.866 --> 00:44:29.006 A:middle
accompaniment for our service

00:44:29.086 --> 00:44:30.466 A:middle
integrations, because in

00:44:30.466 --> 00:44:32.196 A:middle
addition to GitHub, we're adding

00:44:32.376 --> 00:44:33.916 A:middle
two new services this year,

00:44:34.676 --> 00:44:35.616 A:middle
support for Atlassian's

00:44:35.676 --> 00:44:37.166 A:middle
Bitbucket cloud and Bitbucket

00:44:37.256 --> 00:44:37.566 A:middle
server --

[ Applause ]

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:44.766 A:middle
-- and support for GitLab.com

00:44:45.096 --> 00:44:45.846 A:middle
and self-hosting.

00:44:46.516 --> 00:44:49.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:50.316 --> 00:44:51.366 A:middle
There's a lot of source control

00:44:51.406 --> 00:44:51.836 A:middle
love here.

00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:54.366 A:middle
And both of these work great

00:44:54.496 --> 00:44:55.786 A:middle
because their web interfaces

00:44:55.786 --> 00:44:57.636 A:middle
will check out directly into

00:44:57.636 --> 00:44:57.976 A:middle
Xcode.

00:44:59.386 --> 00:45:01.006 A:middle
Now as Sebastian mentioned
