your applications which we are

00:29:00.856 --> 00:29:02.886 A:middle
planning to do next year.

00:29:04.496 --> 00:29:09.216 A:middle
Next, Dark Mode -- you've seen

00:29:09.406 --> 00:29:12.196 A:middle
that Dark Mode is a big thing

00:29:12.196 --> 00:29:13.966 A:middle
for MacOS Mojave and we think it

00:29:13.966 --> 00:29:14.576 A:middle
looks stunning.

00:29:14.576 --> 00:29:15.956 A:middle
Let's take a quick tour.

00:29:20.076 --> 00:29:21.276 A:middle
The window background is dark

00:29:21.566 --> 00:29:23.786 A:middle
making the content pop.

00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:26.216 A:middle
The sidebar is translucent and

00:29:26.456 --> 00:29:28.556 A:middle
the content is blended vibrantly

00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:31.456 A:middle
which preserves contrast with

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:32.816 A:middle
whatever may be underneath the

00:29:32.816 --> 00:29:33.076 A:middle
window.

00:29:33.076 --> 00:29:36.506 A:middle
And in a few cases, we found it

00:29:36.506 --> 00:29:38.356 A:middle
valuable to change the icons

00:29:38.356 --> 00:29:40.136 A:middle
slightly so you can see a slight

00:29:40.186 --> 00:29:42.236 A:middle
darkening of this photo icon and

00:29:42.236 --> 00:29:44.126 A:middle
a new dark trash can.

00:29:45.136 --> 00:29:46.346 A:middle
But there's something very

00:29:46.346 --> 00:29:46.946 A:middle
subtle here.

00:29:47.756 --> 00:29:49.176 A:middle
The window background is

00:29:49.176 --> 00:29:50.536 A:middle
actually picking up a slight

00:29:50.536 --> 00:29:52.096 A:middle
hint of color from the desktop.

00:29:53.716 --> 00:29:55.316 A:middle
To show you what I mean, here is

00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:57.296 A:middle
a window on top of two very

00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:57.976 A:middle
different desktop pictures.

00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:01.446 A:middle
On the left side, there's a
