00:36:59.476 --> 00:37:01.166 A:middle
interfaces, the library is an

00:37:01.266 --> 00:37:02.796 A:middle
important tool, and we have a

00:37:02.796 --> 00:37:04.046 A:middle
whole new workflow for you

00:37:04.676 --> 00:37:05.956 A:middle
because the library is now

00:37:06.126 --> 00:37:07.466 A:middle
separate from the inspectors.

00:37:08.246 --> 00:37:09.596 A:middle
You can now take the library and

00:37:09.596 --> 00:37:10.906 A:middle
reposition it wherever you want.

00:37:11.556 --> 00:37:13.196 A:middle
you can adjust the size to match

00:37:13.196 --> 00:37:13.666 A:middle
your layout.

00:37:14.286 --> 00:37:15.846 A:middle
And you can keep the library up

00:37:15.846 --> 00:37:17.276 A:middle
while working or have it

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.746 A:middle
automatically dismiss when you

00:37:18.746 --> 00:37:18.966 A:middle
are done.

00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:25.066 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:26.896 A:middle
And the library works great with

00:37:26.896 --> 00:37:28.176 A:middle
all of our content types,

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.946 A:middle
including media and code

00:37:31.056 --> 00:37:31.596 A:middle
snippets.

00:37:31.596 --> 00:37:32.746 A:middle
And finally, with our design

00:37:32.746 --> 00:37:33.876 A:middle
tools, you'll notice they're

00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:35.636 A:middle
just snappier, with faster

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:37.536 A:middle
document loading and more

00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:39.436 A:middle
responsive canvas interactions.

00:37:40.666 --> 00:37:42.056 A:middle
Now we've also spent time

00:37:42.056 --> 00:37:43.706 A:middle
focusing on our source editing

00:37:43.756 --> 00:37:46.716 A:middle
tools, keeping them fast, fluid,

00:37:46.716 --> 00:37:47.286 A:middle
and informative.

00:37:47.286 --> 00:37:49.706 A:middle
We started with performance,

00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:50.626 A:middle
where you'll now see the editor

00:37:50.626 --> 00:37:52.246 A:middle
loads large documents much

00:37:52.306 --> 00:37:54.166 A:middle
faster, all while keeping smooth

00:37:54.166 --> 00:37:55.996 A:middle
scrolling at 60 frames a second.

00:37:57.016 --> 00:37:58.596 A:middle
Next, we double down on

00:37:58.666 --> 00:38:00.516 A:middle
stability in SourceKit and
