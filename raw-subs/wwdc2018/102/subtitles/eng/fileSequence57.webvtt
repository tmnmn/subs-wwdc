00:56:58.616 --> 00:57:01.146 A:middle
features, including support for

00:57:01.146 --> 00:57:03.396 A:middle
custom models now and, a very

00:57:03.396 --> 00:57:04.886 A:middle
popular feature, flexible

00:57:04.886 --> 00:57:05.366 A:middle
shapes.

00:57:05.656 --> 00:57:06.826 A:middle
So you no longer need to ship a

00:57:06.826 --> 00:57:08.376 A:middle
model for each shape that you

00:57:08.376 --> 00:57:09.266 A:middle
want to do inference on.

00:57:09.586 --> 00:57:11.396 A:middle
You ship one model, and our

00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:13.076 A:middle
simple API takes care of

00:57:13.076 --> 00:57:17.076 A:middle
everything for you.

00:57:17.296 --> 00:57:18.936 A:middle
now let's talk about Create ML,

00:57:19.006 --> 00:57:21.776 A:middle
our brand-new, easy-to-use

00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:22.896 A:middle
machine learning training

00:57:22.896 --> 00:57:23.336 A:middle
framework.

00:57:24.096 --> 00:57:25.926 A:middle
It brings together the power of

00:57:25.926 --> 00:57:28.276 A:middle
Machine Learning, Swift, and

00:57:28.276 --> 00:57:29.716 A:middle
Xcode, and Xcode Playgrounds.

00:57:31.536 --> 00:57:33.166 A:middle
No more downloading packages

00:57:33.166 --> 00:57:34.206 A:middle
from the Internet and going

00:57:34.206 --> 00:57:35.256 A:middle
through long, complicated

00:57:35.256 --> 00:57:36.616 A:middle
tutorials to portray a model.

00:57:38.406 --> 00:57:39.636 A:middle
We support feature-level

00:57:39.636 --> 00:57:41.586 A:middle
training such as image

00:57:41.586 --> 00:57:42.676 A:middle
classification and natural

00:57:42.676 --> 00:57:43.076 A:middle
language.

00:57:44.256 --> 00:57:45.736 A:middle
And if you do want to go deeper

00:57:45.736 --> 00:57:47.336 A:middle
in machine learning, we support

00:57:47.336 --> 00:57:49.226 A:middle
traditional types of algorithms

00:57:49.276 --> 00:57:50.576 A:middle
such as linear regression and

00:57:50.576 --> 00:57:52.336 A:middle
boosted trees as well as

00:57:52.336 --> 00:57:53.516 A:middle
traditional data processing.

00:57:53.666 --> 00:57:56.106 A:middle
But we think people will want to

00:57:56.106 --> 00:57:57.906 A:middle
use these feature type of

00:57:57.906 --> 00:57:59.476 A:middle
training far more, so let's look

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:00.596 A:middle
at those examples.
