00:24:58.856 --> 00:25:00.496 A:middle
provide custom actions from your

00:25:00.496 --> 00:25:01.936 A:middle
applications using app

00:25:01.936 --> 00:25:02.636 A:middle
extensions.

00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:05.366 A:middle
And as an end-user, you can also

00:25:05.366 --> 00:25:07.376 A:middle
combine shell scripts,

00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:09.146 A:middle
AppleScripts and Automator

00:25:09.146 --> 00:25:11.496 A:middle
Actions in Automator to create

00:25:11.496 --> 00:25:12.186 A:middle
an action bundle.

00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:14.816 A:middle
And these action bundles will be

00:25:14.816 --> 00:25:17.046 A:middle
shown here in Finder as well

00:25:17.046 --> 00:25:18.726 A:middle
based on file type.

00:25:19.456 --> 00:25:20.986 A:middle
These Custom Actions get some

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.216 A:middle
prime real estate in Finder and

00:25:23.216 --> 00:25:24.726 A:middle
even more so in Touch Bar.

00:25:25.176 --> 00:25:26.346 A:middle
Touch Bar is great when

00:25:26.346 --> 00:25:26.996 A:middle
customized.

00:25:27.346 --> 00:25:28.686 A:middle
And you can customize Touch Bar

00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:29.906 A:middle
to show these actions all the

00:25:29.906 --> 00:25:31.576 A:middle
time or on the tap of a button.

00:25:33.006 --> 00:25:35.546 A:middle
Moving on, in the keynote this

00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:37.566 A:middle
morning, you got a sneak peek at

00:25:37.566 --> 00:25:39.286 A:middle
another technology we are really

00:25:39.286 --> 00:25:39.906 A:middle
excited about.

00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:42.796 A:middle
An easy way to bring iOS apps to

00:25:43.856 --> 00:25:44.626 A:middle
the Mac.

00:25:44.896 --> 00:25:46.076 A:middle
We are in the midst of

00:25:46.076 --> 00:25:48.016 A:middle
developing this technology in

00:25:48.016 --> 00:25:49.426 A:middle
the context of these four apps,

00:25:49.976 --> 00:25:52.166 A:middle
News, Stocks, Voice Memos and

00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:52.486 A:middle
Home.

00:25:53.216 --> 00:25:57.076 A:middle
These apps utilize UIKit and

00:25:57.336 --> 00:25:59.376 A:middle
this is a new way to delivery

00:25:59.376 --> 00:26:01.746 A:middle
great Mac apps.
