PlanetUpdateService.swift --

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:02.106 A:middle
this is the file that handles

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:03.056 A:middle
that planetary update.

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:05.096 A:middle
So I want to add some logs, some

00:15:05.176 --> 00:15:06.926 A:middle
signposts to help me understand

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:08.266 A:middle
what's going on in my code.

00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:10.696 A:middle
So I'm going to start by adding

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:11.506 A:middle
a log handle.

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:13.566 A:middle
So I'm going to use the new

00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:17.296 A:middle
pointsOfInterest category.

00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:19.536 A:middle
Now this is a special new

00:15:19.536 --> 00:15:20.166 A:middle
category.

00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:22.276 A:middle
Anything that I log with it is

00:15:22.346 --> 00:15:23.636 A:middle
automatically going to show up

00:15:23.636 --> 00:15:24.846 A:middle
right inside instruments.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.256 A:middle
Now, the first thing I want to

00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:29.956 A:middle
see is when we kick off this

00:15:30.036 --> 00:15:30.596 A:middle
update.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.276 A:middle
And that happens in this method.

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:33.756 A:middle
So I'm going to add my first log

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:34.906 A:middle
statement here.

00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:36.186 A:middle
I'm going to say requesting

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:37.846 A:middle
planet data so that we could see

00:15:37.846 --> 00:15:38.176 A:middle
that.

00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:40.656 A:middle
And then what I really want to

00:15:40.656 --> 00:15:43.156 A:middle
know is how long is it taking to

00:15:43.156 --> 00:15:45.706 A:middle
process and parse all the data

00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:46.666 A:middle
that I'm doing here?

00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:49.646 A:middle
So right here is where that

00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:50.336 A:middle
happens.

00:15:50.796 --> 00:15:52.476 A:middle
And to help me visualize this,

00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:53.196 A:middle
I'm going to add a couple of

00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:53.906 A:middle
signposts.

00:15:54.476 --> 00:15:55.866 A:middle
So the first signpost is going

00:15:56.666 --> 00:15:58.946 A:middle
to be a begin-type signpost

00:15:58.946 --> 00:16:00.666 A:middle
here, just before I start doing
