00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.786 A:middle
Mac apps look great in Dark Mode

00:33:01.836 --> 00:33:01.976 A:middle
too.

00:33:06.046 --> 00:33:07.946 A:middle
So here we are back in our solar

00:33:07.946 --> 00:33:08.826 A:middle
system application.

00:33:09.576 --> 00:33:10.886 A:middle
We've been converting it over to

00:33:10.886 --> 00:33:12.006 A:middle
Dark Mode and we've made great

00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:12.896 A:middle
progress so far.

00:33:13.356 --> 00:33:15.036 A:middle
There's a couple of items left I

00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:15.936 A:middle
need to finish here.

00:33:16.716 --> 00:33:17.786 A:middle
There's a darker version of this

00:33:17.786 --> 00:33:19.326 A:middle
globe my designers have provided

00:33:19.326 --> 00:33:19.746 A:middle
to us.

00:33:20.036 --> 00:33:21.806 A:middle
And there's these two hard-coded

00:33:22.006 --> 00:33:23.786 A:middle
boxes that have colors that I

00:33:23.786 --> 00:33:24.466 A:middle
need to change.

00:33:25.286 --> 00:33:27.006 A:middle
Xcode's asset catalogs makes

00:33:27.056 --> 00:33:27.546 A:middle
this easy.

00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:29.866 A:middle
Let's start with this image.

00:33:31.026 --> 00:33:32.406 A:middle
I'll change over to the tab with

00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:34.066 A:middle
my assets and we can see, I've

00:33:34.066 --> 00:33:35.946 A:middle
already defined dark variance

00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:37.116 A:middle
for all of my colors.

00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:39.896 A:middle
I'll select the group with all

00:33:39.896 --> 00:33:41.576 A:middle
of my images and here's the

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.026 A:middle
planet image I'd like to add a

00:33:43.026 --> 00:33:43.926 A:middle
dark variant for.

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:45.276 A:middle
That's easy.

00:33:46.126 --> 00:33:46.796 A:middle
I'll select it.

00:33:47.426 --> 00:33:49.416 A:middle
Go in the Inspector and add a

00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:50.096 A:middle
dark variant.

00:33:50.586 --> 00:33:52.246 A:middle
And my designers have sent me

00:33:52.246 --> 00:33:53.596 A:middle
the assets here so I can just

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:54.606 A:middle
pull them out of my downloads

00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:56.676 A:middle
folder and put them into the

00:33:56.676 --> 00:33:57.146 A:middle
catalog.

00:33:58.176 --> 00:33:58.866 A:middle
That's it.

00:33:59.536 --> 00:34:00.786 A:middle
You'll see when I go back to my
