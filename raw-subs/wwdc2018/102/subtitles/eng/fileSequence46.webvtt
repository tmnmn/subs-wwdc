00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:00.016 A:middle
background usage.

00:46:01.086 --> 00:46:02.576 A:middle
These reports show up in the

00:46:02.576 --> 00:46:04.326 A:middle
organizer and include stack

00:46:04.326 --> 00:46:05.916 A:middle
frames to illustrate the issue.

00:46:06.896 --> 00:46:08.196 A:middle
And just like with crash logs,

00:46:08.196 --> 00:46:09.876 A:middle
you can open these reports in

00:46:09.876 --> 00:46:11.446 A:middle
your project to navigate your

00:46:11.446 --> 00:46:13.306 A:middle
code and find and fix the

00:46:13.306 --> 00:46:13.756 A:middle
issues.

00:46:15.006 --> 00:46:16.646 A:middle
Oh, and to go alongside these,

00:46:16.646 --> 00:46:17.776 A:middle
we also have some improvements

00:46:17.896 --> 00:46:19.456 A:middle
in testing.

00:46:19.806 --> 00:46:21.346 A:middle
Earlier this spring, we enhanced

00:46:21.386 --> 00:46:23.116 A:middle
code coverage, adding a command

00:46:23.116 --> 00:46:24.466 A:middle
line tool to access coverage

00:46:24.466 --> 00:46:26.456 A:middle
data, and giving you the ability

00:46:26.456 --> 00:46:28.476 A:middle
to select individual targets to

00:46:28.476 --> 00:46:29.396 A:middle
collect coverage for.

00:46:30.286 --> 00:46:31.436 A:middle
This means your coverage reports

00:46:31.436 --> 00:46:33.176 A:middle
can now be actively focused on

00:46:33.176 --> 00:46:34.766 A:middle
the areas you are coding and

00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:35.106 A:middle
testing.

00:46:36.266 --> 00:46:38.106 A:middle
In addition to these, we're

00:46:38.106 --> 00:46:40.216 A:middle
adding two new testing workflows

00:46:40.216 --> 00:46:41.676 A:middle
this year -- actually, three.

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.226 A:middle
The first is that you can now

00:46:44.226 --> 00:46:45.976 A:middle
automatically include or exclude

00:46:45.976 --> 00:46:47.986 A:middle
new tests in your test bundles.

00:46:48.616 --> 00:46:50.486 A:middle
Next, you can randomize the

00:46:50.486 --> 00:46:51.626 A:middle
order that your tests are

00:46:51.626 --> 00:46:53.306 A:middle
executed in to minimize

00:46:53.306 --> 00:46:54.506 A:middle
accidental dependencies.

00:46:55.536 --> 00:46:56.726 A:middle
And our biggest change for this

00:46:56.726 --> 00:46:58.496 A:middle
year is you can now execute your

00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:00.626 A:middle
tests in parallel inside of
