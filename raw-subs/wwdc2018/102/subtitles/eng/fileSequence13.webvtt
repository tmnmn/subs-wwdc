00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:01.086 A:middle
We've developed a lot of new

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:02.806 A:middle
tools and techniques and want to

00:13:02.806 --> 00:13:03.936 A:middle
bring you some of these powerful

00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:04.736 A:middle
new capabilities.

00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:07.696 A:middle
So in Xcode 10, we've extended

00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:09.276 A:middle
instruments capabilities and

00:13:09.496 --> 00:13:10.856 A:middle
enabled you to take it even

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:12.216 A:middle
further with your own custom

00:13:12.216 --> 00:13:13.466 A:middle
tools and work flows.

00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:15.706 A:middle
Now this all starts from a

00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:16.806 A:middle
legacy API.

00:13:17.106 --> 00:13:18.246 A:middle
Some of you may know this and

00:13:18.246 --> 00:13:19.196 A:middle
have used it.

00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:21.126 A:middle
I know I'm guilty of it --

00:13:21.596 --> 00:13:23.286 A:middle
printf, it's like the Swiss Army

00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:24.316 A:middle
knife of APIs.

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:25.816 A:middle
We use it to debug and trace

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:27.276 A:middle
through our code but we all know

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:28.166 A:middle
that it's slow.

00:13:28.676 --> 00:13:30.156 A:middle
And so two years ago, we brought

00:13:30.156 --> 00:13:32.546 A:middle
you this new API called os log.

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:34.266 A:middle
It's an efficient and performant

00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:36.266 A:middle
API that captures logs and

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:38.006 A:middle
tracepoints across all levels of

00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:38.626 A:middle
the system.

00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:41.366 A:middle
It's fast and lightweight and if

00:13:41.366 --> 00:13:42.836 A:middle
you've not adopted it already,

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:43.436 A:middle
you really should.

00:13:43.436 --> 00:13:43.926 A:middle
It's great.

00:13:44.566 --> 00:13:45.796 A:middle
And our newest addition this

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:47.466 A:middle
year builds on top of os log and

00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:49.336 A:middle
it's called os signpost.

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:51.326 A:middle
It's a powerful technique that

00:13:51.376 --> 00:13:53.656 A:middle
provides rich, contextual data

00:13:53.656 --> 00:13:55.776 A:middle
for your application in a format

00:13:55.776 --> 00:13:57.606 A:middle
that instruments can interpret.

00:13:57.606 --> 00:13:59.996 A:middle
So you could use signpost to

00:13:59.996 --> 00:14:01.816 A:middle
trace through your code and you
