00:18:59.816 --> 00:19:01.796 A:middle
insights that I need to help me

00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:03.516 A:middle
use this framework more

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:04.086 A:middle
effectively.

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:07.126 A:middle
So signposts, Custom Instruments

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:09.146 A:middle
packages, two really great new

00:19:09.146 --> 00:19:10.926 A:middle
ways for you to visualize your

00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:12.516 A:middle
data right in Instruments.

00:19:12.856 --> 00:19:13.566 A:middle
And that's a look at the new

00:19:13.566 --> 00:19:14.316 A:middle
performance tools.

00:19:14.476 --> 00:19:14.976 A:middle
Sebastian?

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:19.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:20.046 --> 00:19:20.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:21.476 A:middle
Thank you, Ken.

00:19:21.476 --> 00:19:23.116 A:middle
That's a really, really amazing

00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:23.866 A:middle
demo.

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:25.276 A:middle
Really great tools that all of

00:19:25.276 --> 00:19:27.046 A:middle
you can use to make your apps

00:19:27.556 --> 00:19:28.856 A:middle
run even faster.

00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:32.396 A:middle
Now, to recap, we just reviewed

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:33.886 A:middle
a lot of great tools and best

00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:35.726 A:middle
practices that we can use to

00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.626 A:middle
ensure that we delight our users

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:38.746 A:middle
and keep their trust.

00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:41.676 A:middle
Now, I'd like to turn our

00:19:41.676 --> 00:19:42.976 A:middle
attention to the Mac.

00:19:43.186 --> 00:19:46.516 A:middle
OS X was launched 17 years ago

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.336 A:middle
and we've constantly pushed the

00:19:48.336 --> 00:19:49.366 A:middle
platform forward.

00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:53.346 A:middle
64-bit support in Leopard, MacOS

00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:54.386 A:middle
Mountain Lion introduced

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:56.246 A:middle
Gatekeeper, a key step forward

00:19:56.246 --> 00:19:56.976 A:middle
in Mac security.

00:19:57.046 --> 00:19:59.296 A:middle
And one of our key missions is

00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:00.626 A:middle
to always push the Mac forward
