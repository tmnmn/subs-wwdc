00:38:59.486 --> 00:39:01.126 A:middle
embraced the opportunity and

00:39:01.126 --> 00:39:02.536 A:middle
added a number of new actions.

00:39:03.936 --> 00:39:05.606 A:middle
These actions all streamline

00:39:05.606 --> 00:39:07.526 A:middle
common programming scenarios and

00:39:07.526 --> 00:39:08.956 A:middle
are built right into Xcode now,

00:39:09.446 --> 00:39:10.336 A:middle
just a click away.

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.526 A:middle
Now refactoring is just one of

00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:15.266 A:middle
many ways you can modify the

00:39:15.356 --> 00:39:16.196 A:middle
source in your project.

00:39:16.846 --> 00:39:17.876 A:middle
And to make it easier to keep

00:39:17.876 --> 00:39:19.806 A:middle
track of your changes, we're

00:39:19.806 --> 00:39:21.326 A:middle
introducing a source control

00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:22.056 A:middle
change bar.

00:39:23.336 --> 00:39:24.706 A:middle
The change bar is on the left

00:39:24.706 --> 00:39:25.896 A:middle
side of the editor and

00:39:25.896 --> 00:39:27.326 A:middle
highlights lines of code which

00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:28.856 A:middle
have changed since your last

00:39:28.856 --> 00:39:29.156 A:middle
checkout.

00:39:29.946 --> 00:39:31.896 A:middle
The style and color of the

00:39:31.896 --> 00:39:33.576 A:middle
indicator reveal the type of

00:39:33.576 --> 00:39:35.326 A:middle
change, making it easy for you

00:39:35.326 --> 00:39:37.046 A:middle
to see at a glance changes you

00:39:37.046 --> 00:39:38.516 A:middle
have made, your team members

00:39:38.516 --> 00:39:40.176 A:middle
have made, and those which might

00:39:40.226 --> 00:39:41.016 A:middle
be in conflict.

00:39:41.836 --> 00:39:44.466 A:middle
Now this feature is -- yes.

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:49.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:50.086 --> 00:39:51.256 A:middle
I agree. I think this feature is

00:39:51.296 --> 00:39:51.796 A:middle
pretty awesome.

00:39:51.796 --> 00:39:52.706 A:middle
And I'd actually like to show it

00:39:52.706 --> 00:39:53.966 A:middle
to you in a demo now.

00:39:55.886 --> 00:39:57.336 A:middle
So we're going to go back to our

00:39:57.336 --> 00:39:59.686 A:middle
solar system application, and I

00:39:59.686 --> 00:40:00.906 A:middle
have some changes I'd like to
