sensitive data that resides on

00:07:00.706 --> 00:07:03.176 A:middle
the device in apps and in the

00:07:03.176 --> 00:07:05.166 A:middle
cloud, we think about security

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:06.076 A:middle
holistically.

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:09.336 A:middle
And we provide technologies to

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.556 A:middle
make it easy for you to build

00:07:11.616 --> 00:07:12.976 A:middle
secure apps.

00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:14.606 A:middle
Here's a few examples of the

00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.016 A:middle
technologies that we provide.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:20.876 A:middle
On iOS, we automatically encrypt

00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:22.316 A:middle
app data by default.

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:25.736 A:middle
Over the network, App Transport

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:27.506 A:middle
Security means you never have to

00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:29.186 A:middle
patch client networking

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:29.816 A:middle
libraries again.

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:33.506 A:middle
Now in CloudKit in the cloud,

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:35.836 A:middle
CloudKit securely stores and

00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:37.856 A:middle
syncs data across devices.

00:07:39.186 --> 00:07:40.736 A:middle
Letting you focus on building a

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:42.546 A:middle
great experience for your users

00:07:42.866 --> 00:07:44.186 A:middle
without having to worry about

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:46.446 A:middle
managing account state or your

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:47.326 A:middle
cloud credentials.

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:50.456 A:middle
And it enables you to take the

00:07:50.456 --> 00:07:51.876 A:middle
best, advantage the best

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:54.026 A:middle
in-class security including

00:07:54.026 --> 00:07:55.726 A:middle
built-in two-factor

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:56.466 A:middle
authentication.

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.076 A:middle
Since its launch three years
