00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:00.746 A:middle
high contrast.

00:12:01.606 --> 00:12:02.716 A:middle
So, I said before that we've

00:12:02.746 --> 00:12:05.256 A:middle
been using NSAppearance for the

00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:07.596 A:middle
high contrast mode of macOS.

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:10.056 A:middle
And one of the nice side effects

00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:11.196 A:middle
of doing all this work to

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:12.586 A:middle
support Dark Mode is it makes it

00:12:12.586 --> 00:12:14.416 A:middle
really easy to support high

00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:19.546 A:middle
contrast really well as well.

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:21.636 A:middle
As a reminder, high contrast is

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:23.356 A:middle
enabled through the increase

00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:24.846 A:middle
contrast checkbox in system

00:12:24.846 --> 00:12:25.496 A:middle
preferences.

00:12:26.056 --> 00:12:29.586 A:middle
And in this mode, colors are

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:31.346 A:middle
changed so that control bounds

00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:32.946 A:middle
and other kinds of boundaries

00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:36.366 A:middle
are more easy to see.

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:38.696 A:middle
Now, in this mode, AppKit

00:12:38.786 --> 00:12:41.286 A:middle
automatically replaces the aqua

00:12:41.286 --> 00:12:43.036 A:middle
and darkAqua appearances with

00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:44.656 A:middle
high contrast counterparts.

00:12:45.186 --> 00:12:46.576 A:middle
Now, these high contrast

00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:48.296 A:middle
appearances inherit from their

00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:50.326 A:middle
normal contrast versions.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:53.236 A:middle
So, what that means is any code

00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:54.706 A:middle
you've written to take advantage

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:56.366 A:middle
of Dark Mode will automatically

00:12:56.396 --> 00:12:58.226 A:middle
apply in high contrast Dark

00:12:58.276 --> 00:12:58.456 A:middle
Mode.
