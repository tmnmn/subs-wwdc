00:40:59.326 --> 00:41:00.586 A:middle
This is a key that you can use

00:41:00.586 --> 00:41:01.956 A:middle
to give yourself time to really

00:41:01.956 --> 00:41:03.506 A:middle
build a great polished update

00:41:03.506 --> 00:41:05.146 A:middle
for supporting Dark Mode.

00:41:07.876 --> 00:41:09.576 A:middle
Finally, some tips and tricks.

00:41:11.416 --> 00:41:13.126 A:middle
First of all, when you're

00:41:13.126 --> 00:41:15.196 A:middle
updating your application, one

00:41:15.196 --> 00:41:16.016 A:middle
of the greatest things that you

00:41:16.016 --> 00:41:17.866 A:middle
can do is just audit your use of

00:41:17.906 --> 00:41:20.366 A:middle
NSColor just by searching

00:41:20.366 --> 00:41:21.066 A:middle
through your code base and

00:41:21.066 --> 00:41:22.606 A:middle
seeing where you're using it.

00:41:23.156 --> 00:41:24.066 A:middle
And you're going to find a

00:41:24.066 --> 00:41:25.866 A:middle
couple situations that you can

00:41:25.866 --> 00:41:27.756 A:middle
use to upgrade to make your Dark

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:28.786 A:middle
Mode experience a lot better.

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.536 A:middle
And so, for example here, we can

00:41:30.536 --> 00:41:31.856 A:middle
find places where we're using

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.016 A:middle
named colors that are not

00:41:33.046 --> 00:41:34.886 A:middle
dynamic and also colors that

00:41:34.886 --> 00:41:36.126 A:middle
have hardcoded components.

00:41:36.386 --> 00:41:37.556 A:middle
And when we encounter these

00:41:37.586 --> 00:41:39.756 A:middle
kinds of situations, we can look

00:41:39.756 --> 00:41:41.446 A:middle
at these and decide one of two

00:41:41.446 --> 00:41:41.956 A:middle
things.

00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:44.876 A:middle
One, maybe there is a built-in

00:41:44.876 --> 00:41:46.226 A:middle
system color that describes what

00:41:46.226 --> 00:41:47.746 A:middle
I'm going for and is fully

00:41:47.746 --> 00:41:48.976 A:middle
dynamic for the appearance.

00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:51.596 A:middle
Or, two, this is a custom color

00:41:51.596 --> 00:41:53.006 A:middle
that I think is really important

00:41:53.006 --> 00:41:53.936 A:middle
to be specific to my

00:41:53.936 --> 00:41:54.576 A:middle
application.

00:41:55.286 --> 00:41:56.496 A:middle
And so the first case is pretty

00:41:56.496 --> 00:41:57.066 A:middle
straightforward.

00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:58.236 A:middle
We were using black color for

00:41:58.236 --> 00:41:59.526 A:middle
this label and we can just

00:41:59.526 --> 00:42:00.696 A:middle
switch that to labelColor and
