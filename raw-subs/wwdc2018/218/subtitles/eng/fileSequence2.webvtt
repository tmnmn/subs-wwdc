use of them in your UI.

00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:03.296 A:middle
Then I'll hand it over to Jeff

00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:05.296 A:middle
and he'll talk about vibrant

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:06.716 A:middle
blending, which is an awesome

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.946 A:middle
way to make your views look

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:08.446 A:middle
great.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.576 A:middle
As well as reacting correctly to

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:13.336 A:middle
selection using something called

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:14.236 A:middle
background style.

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:17.096 A:middle
Finally, he'll wrap it up with

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.376 A:middle
some discussion on how to back

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:21.036 A:middle
deploy your app to older

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:22.916 A:middle
versions of macOS while still

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.006 A:middle
supporting Dark Mode, as well as

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:26.956 A:middle
some general tips and tricks for

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:28.606 A:middle
polishing your apps for Dark

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:28.796 A:middle
Mode.

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:30.966 A:middle
All right.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:33.006 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.296 A:middle
So, in Mojave, your app will

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:38.886 A:middle
need to look great in light and

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:39.106 A:middle
dark.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.626 A:middle
And the way you'll do that is

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:42.726 A:middle
using something called

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:44.006 A:middle
NSAppearance.

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:47.396 A:middle
NSAppearance is the theme system

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:49.906 A:middle
used throughout Cocoa and the

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:51.966 A:middle
key part about it is you only

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:53.416 A:middle
have to maintain a single view

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.066 A:middle
hierarchy and NSAppearance will

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.176 A:middle
help it look great in light and

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:57.536 A:middle
dark.

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:01.956 A:middle
