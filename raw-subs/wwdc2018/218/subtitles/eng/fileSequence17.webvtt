00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:01.896 A:middle
NSImage or you're using the

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.226 A:middle
layer contents for content scale

00:17:04.226 --> 00:17:06.636 A:middle
API to create layer contents

00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:08.246 A:middle
from an image for your layer.

00:17:09.876 --> 00:17:11.276 A:middle
If you have code like this, you

00:17:11.276 --> 00:17:12.726 A:middle
should know that the image will

00:17:12.726 --> 00:17:14.626 A:middle
not automatically inherit the

00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:15.326 A:middle
appearance.

00:17:15.856 --> 00:17:19.256 A:middle
As before, the best fix is to

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.286 A:middle
switch to views.

00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:21.935 A:middle
In this case, NSImageView.

00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:23.776 A:middle
NSImageView will take care of

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.266 A:middle
this detail as well as a bunch

00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:28.046 A:middle
of others automatically, so do

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:30.576 A:middle
that if you can.

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:32.676 A:middle
Otherwise, you'll need to create

00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:35.266 A:middle
a CGImage from your NSImage for

00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:35.786 A:middle
your layer.

00:17:36.466 --> 00:17:37.776 A:middle
And you'll do that using the

00:17:37.776 --> 00:17:40.166 A:middle
cgImage(forProposedRect:,

00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:43.886 A:middle
context:, hints: API on NSImage.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.056 A:middle
And you'll have to be careful to

00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:47.506 A:middle
do this at a point where the

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.536 A:middle
current appearance is correct.

00:17:49.776 --> 00:17:51.406 A:middle
So, a good place to do it is in

00:17:51.406 --> 00:17:52.486 A:middle
your updateLayer method.

00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:55.596 A:middle
All right, so that's appearance.

00:17:56.486 --> 00:17:57.856 A:middle
Now let's talk about materials.

00:17:57.946 --> 00:18:00.046 A:middle
Now, you've probably heard that
