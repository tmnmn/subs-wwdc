00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:01.116 A:middle
availability check to use our

00:39:01.116 --> 00:39:02.816 A:middle
asset catalog color on operating

00:39:02.816 --> 00:39:04.526 A:middle
systems that support it and then

00:39:04.526 --> 00:39:05.856 A:middle
we can go ahead and put in a

00:39:05.856 --> 00:39:07.516 A:middle
hardcoded fallback color for

00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:09.106 A:middle
those older operating systems.

00:39:09.506 --> 00:39:13.006 A:middle
Desktop-tinted materials is

00:39:13.006 --> 00:39:13.976 A:middle
another great new thing in

00:39:13.976 --> 00:39:16.116 A:middle
Mojave and if you want to

00:39:16.116 --> 00:39:17.556 A:middle
address those materials directly

00:39:17.556 --> 00:39:19.166 A:middle
with VisualEffectView, of course

00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:20.546 A:middle
that's only available starting

00:39:20.546 --> 00:39:23.256 A:middle
in 10.14, but we've been

00:39:23.256 --> 00:39:24.526 A:middle
providing-- but we have classes

00:39:24.556 --> 00:39:25.256 A:middle
that are providing these

00:39:25.256 --> 00:39:26.476 A:middle
materials automatically,

00:39:26.896 --> 00:39:28.236 A:middle
including Window, ScrollView,

00:39:28.236 --> 00:39:29.966 A:middle
and TableView, which have been

00:39:29.966 --> 00:39:31.626 A:middle
available since essentially the

00:39:31.626 --> 00:39:32.336 A:middle
beginning of time.

00:39:32.856 --> 00:39:34.266 A:middle
In fact, some of these predate

00:39:34.416 --> 00:39:35.456 A:middle
macOS 10.0.

00:39:35.776 --> 00:39:37.636 A:middle
And so, if you configure them

00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:40.156 A:middle
correctly, they're going to on

00:39:40.156 --> 00:39:41.956 A:middle
previous operating systems show

00:39:41.956 --> 00:39:43.686 A:middle
that special NSColor which looks

00:39:43.686 --> 00:39:44.626 A:middle
exactly the way that you would

00:39:44.626 --> 00:39:46.866 A:middle
expect in previous versions and

00:39:46.866 --> 00:39:48.116 A:middle
then when you run it on Mojave

00:39:48.116 --> 00:39:48.736 A:middle
you're going to get that

00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:49.786 A:middle
material automatically.

00:39:50.866 --> 00:39:52.886 A:middle
And of course NSBox, the custom

00:39:52.886 --> 00:39:53.876 A:middle
style that allows you to set a

00:39:53.876 --> 00:39:55.786 A:middle
fill color, deploys back to

00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:58.406 A:middle
Leopard 10.5 and so does

00:39:58.406 --> 00:39:59.096 A:middle
NSCollectionView.

00:39:59.496 --> 00:40:00.556 A:middle
And this works whether you're
