00:39:59.496 --> 00:40:00.556 A:middle
And this works whether you're

00:40:00.556 --> 00:40:01.626 A:middle
using the legacy

00:40:01.746 --> 00:40:03.406 A:middle
NSCollectionView API or the

00:40:03.406 --> 00:40:05.016 A:middle
modern one, although we'd prefer

00:40:05.016 --> 00:40:07.776 A:middle
that you use the modern one.

00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:11.706 A:middle
Finally, enabling Dark Mode is

00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:14.386 A:middle
generally gated on linking

00:40:14.386 --> 00:40:17.426 A:middle
against the 10.14 SDK, but, as

00:40:17.426 --> 00:40:19.966 A:middle
you can see, really, the tools

00:40:19.966 --> 00:40:21.376 A:middle
that you need to develop a great

00:40:21.376 --> 00:40:23.126 A:middle
Dark Mode application aren't

00:40:23.126 --> 00:40:24.876 A:middle
necessarily specific to the

00:40:24.876 --> 00:40:26.866 A:middle
10.14 SDK and you could have

00:40:26.866 --> 00:40:28.466 A:middle
developed one just using the

00:40:28.466 --> 00:40:30.126 A:middle
10.13 SDK that you have today.

00:40:31.246 --> 00:40:33.356 A:middle
And so, if you have a situation

00:40:33.356 --> 00:40:34.396 A:middle
where you can't necessarily

00:40:34.396 --> 00:40:36.446 A:middle
update your SDK, we have an

00:40:36.446 --> 00:40:38.036 A:middle
Info.plist key that you can use

00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:39.326 A:middle
to opt-in to Dark Mode.

00:40:39.926 --> 00:40:40.396 A:middle
It's called

00:40:40.506 --> 00:40:42.286 A:middle
NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance

00:40:42.576 --> 00:40:43.706 A:middle
and if you set that to NO

00:40:43.706 --> 00:40:45.206 A:middle
explicitly, then that's going to

00:40:45.206 --> 00:40:46.706 A:middle
enable Dark Mode even if you're

00:40:46.706 --> 00:40:47.926 A:middle
linking on an earlier SDK,

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.176 A:middle
although we very strongly prefer

00:40:50.446 --> 00:40:51.396 A:middle
that you update your SDK.

00:40:51.396 --> 00:40:52.696 A:middle
It's a far better solution.

00:40:53.586 --> 00:40:55.276 A:middle
You can also set this key to YES

00:40:55.276 --> 00:40:57.136 A:middle
to disable it temporarily-- and

00:40:57.136 --> 00:40:58.916 A:middle
I want to emphasize temporarily.

00:40:59.326 --> 00:41:00.586 A:middle
This is a key that you can use
