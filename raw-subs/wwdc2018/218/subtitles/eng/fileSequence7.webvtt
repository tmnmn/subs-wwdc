00:06:57.386 --> 00:07:00.506 A:middle
windows-- and you just assign it

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:03.926 A:middle
to the appearanceSource property

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:06.176 A:middle
and the window will inherit its

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.526 A:middle
appearance from that object.

00:07:08.146 --> 00:07:11.516 A:middle
So, in this case, we'll assign

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:12.636 A:middle
the text view to the

00:07:12.636 --> 00:07:14.926 A:middle
appearanceSource property of

00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:16.816 A:middle
that child window and now it's

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:18.186 A:middle
appearance will always inherit

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:19.956 A:middle
from that view no matter what it

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:20.746 A:middle
is.

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:24.826 A:middle
In fact, you should think of the

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:26.616 A:middle
appearance system as a sort of

00:07:26.616 --> 00:07:27.316 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:29.666 A:middle
Similar to the view hierarchy

00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:30.926 A:middle
you're probably familiar with,

00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:32.726 A:middle
but extending to windows and the

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:33.756 A:middle
application as well.

00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:37.196 A:middle
And when we ask AppKit for a

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:38.686 A:middle
view's effective appearance,

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.806 A:middle
AppKit will simply walk up this

00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:43.646 A:middle
hierarchy until it finds an

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:45.116 A:middle
object with a specified

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:47.486 A:middle
appearance and that's the

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:48.546 A:middle
appearance we'll use.

00:07:49.096 --> 00:07:49.196 A:middle
OK.

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:53.326 A:middle
So, now that we know how objects

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:54.406 A:middle
get an appearance and how the

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:55.876 A:middle
appearance system works, let's

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:57.156 A:middle
talk about how you can use it in

00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:58.676 A:middle
your custom views and controls.

00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:00.876 A:middle
Here's an example.
