00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
yourself and add it to your UI

00:19:01.136 --> 00:19:02.156 A:middle
using a view called

00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:03.676 A:middle
NSVisualEffectView.

00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:05.416 A:middle
If you're not familiar with

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:07.206 A:middle
NSVisualEffectView, quite

00:19:07.206 --> 00:19:09.016 A:middle
simply, it's a view that shows a

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:09.466 A:middle
material.

00:19:10.676 --> 00:19:11.836 A:middle
And if you want to use one,

00:19:12.346 --> 00:19:14.136 A:middle
you'll need to be aware of three

00:19:14.136 --> 00:19:15.406 A:middle
main properties that you'll have

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.156 A:middle
to set up and I'll go through

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:17.696 A:middle
these in order.

00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:19.556 A:middle
The state, blendingMode, and

00:19:19.556 --> 00:19:20.636 A:middle
material properties.

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:24.206 A:middle
So, first, the state property.

00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:27.336 A:middle
This controls whether the

00:19:27.336 --> 00:19:29.536 A:middle
material uses the active window

00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:29.786 A:middle
look.

00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:31.776 A:middle
Now, by default, the material

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.366 A:middle
will just match its containing

00:19:33.366 --> 00:19:34.916 A:middle
window and so when that window

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:36.256 A:middle
is active it'll look active.

00:19:36.556 --> 00:19:37.926 A:middle
When the window's inactive, the

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.106 A:middle
material will look inactive.

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:42.456 A:middle
But you can also specify this

00:19:42.866 --> 00:19:44.776 A:middle
specifically to be active or

00:19:44.776 --> 00:19:46.076 A:middle
inactive if you'd like to

00:19:46.076 --> 00:19:47.006 A:middle
control it manually.

00:19:49.546 --> 00:19:50.556 A:middle
Second, the blendingMode

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.076 A:middle
property.

00:19:51.776 --> 00:19:53.846 A:middle
This property controls whether

00:19:53.846 --> 00:19:55.886 A:middle
the material punches through the

00:19:55.886 --> 00:19:56.646 A:middle
back of the window.

00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:57.926 A:middle
Let me show you what I mean by

00:19:57.926 --> 00:19:58.146 A:middle
that.

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:02.106 A:middle
Here's a preview using two
