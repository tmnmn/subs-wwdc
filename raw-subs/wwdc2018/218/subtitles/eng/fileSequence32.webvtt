00:31:59.696 --> 00:32:00.876 A:middle
color and it's going to wash it

00:32:00.876 --> 00:32:01.846 A:middle
out in a way that is not

00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:02.366 A:middle
desirable.

00:32:03.376 --> 00:32:04.456 A:middle
I'll show you an example of that

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:04.726 A:middle
later.

00:32:06.866 --> 00:32:08.836 A:middle
So, revisiting our application,

00:32:09.236 --> 00:32:11.496 A:middle
we can go ahead and override

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:13.066 A:middle
allowsVibrancy on our view and

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.116 A:middle
in this case we're going to just

00:32:14.116 --> 00:32:15.826 A:middle
set it on the view that contains

00:32:15.826 --> 00:32:18.256 A:middle
our entire meter in the entire

00:32:18.256 --> 00:32:18.806 A:middle
popover.

00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:20.136 A:middle
And let's see what that looks

00:32:20.136 --> 00:32:20.326 A:middle
like.

00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:23.796 A:middle
Well, our slider looks pretty

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:24.106 A:middle
good.

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:25.946 A:middle
It's exactly what we expected.

00:32:25.946 --> 00:32:27.326 A:middle
But what happened to the faces?

00:32:28.016 --> 00:32:28.756 A:middle
They're all washed out.

00:32:30.146 --> 00:32:32.286 A:middle
And what happened here is that

00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:34.336 A:middle
when we set allowsVibrancy on

00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:36.946 A:middle
the overall meter view, not only

00:32:36.946 --> 00:32:37.726 A:middle
are we getting the vibrant

00:32:37.726 --> 00:32:39.636 A:middle
blending on that view, but also

00:32:39.716 --> 00:32:41.056 A:middle
both of these subviews.

00:32:42.216 --> 00:32:43.086 A:middle
And the fix here is pretty

00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:43.456 A:middle
simple.

00:32:44.016 --> 00:32:45.646 A:middle
If we localize our definition of

00:32:45.646 --> 00:32:47.266 A:middle
allowsVibrancy to just the part

00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:49.086 A:middle
that's drawing the slider, we

00:32:49.086 --> 00:32:50.386 A:middle
get exactly what we expected.

00:32:50.806 --> 00:32:52.146 A:middle
Our slider is drawing vibrantly

00:32:52.556 --> 00:32:53.786 A:middle
and the colors in our face

00:32:53.836 --> 00:32:55.296 A:middle
buttons look exactly the way

00:32:55.296 --> 00:32:55.846 A:middle
that we wanted.

00:32:57.366 --> 00:32:58.286 A:middle
When you're drawing vibrantly,

00:32:58.286 --> 00:32:59.536 A:middle
typically you'd want to apply

00:32:59.536 --> 00:33:01.376 A:middle
vibrancy to only the leaf views
