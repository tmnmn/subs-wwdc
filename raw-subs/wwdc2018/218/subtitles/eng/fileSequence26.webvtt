00:25:58.796 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
zoom in closely, you'll see that

00:26:01.296 --> 00:26:02.696 A:middle
the bubbles are not getting that

00:26:02.746 --> 00:26:04.166 A:middle
desktop-tinting effect that we

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:04.476 A:middle
want.

00:26:04.476 --> 00:26:05.676 A:middle
It's just a plain gray.

00:26:07.096 --> 00:26:07.986 A:middle
So, what went wrong?

00:26:09.376 --> 00:26:11.766 A:middle
Well, this effect is provided by

00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:13.136 A:middle
the Quartz window server like a

00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:14.376 A:middle
lot of our other material

00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:14.876 A:middle
effects.

00:26:15.746 --> 00:26:16.876 A:middle
And what this means is it

00:26:16.976 --> 00:26:19.216 A:middle
updates asynchronously from your

00:26:19.216 --> 00:26:20.856 A:middle
application and this is great

00:26:20.906 --> 00:26:23.706 A:middle
for performance, but it also

00:26:23.706 --> 00:26:25.516 A:middle
means that you can't directly

00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:27.396 A:middle
draw with that color or get it's

00:26:27.396 --> 00:26:28.476 A:middle
RGB values.

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:31.676 A:middle
Instead, you can use the

00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:33.546 A:middle
maskImage property of

00:26:33.546 --> 00:26:35.156 A:middle
VisualEffectView to do something

00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:35.806 A:middle
very similar.

00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:40.276 A:middle
maskImage is an optional NSImage

00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:43.336 A:middle
on VisualEffectView that

00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:45.696 A:middle
VisualEffectView will use to

00:26:45.696 --> 00:26:47.706 A:middle
mask its material, the material

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.386 A:middle
that it shows.

00:26:49.646 --> 00:26:50.996 A:middle
And in addition to using

00:26:50.996 --> 00:26:53.126 A:middle
standard art-based images, you

00:26:53.126 --> 00:26:54.866 A:middle
can use drawing handler images

00:26:55.006 --> 00:26:56.506 A:middle
to simulate drawing with the

00:26:56.506 --> 00:26:56.996 A:middle
material.

00:26:56.996 --> 00:26:59.356 A:middle
Let me show you an example.
