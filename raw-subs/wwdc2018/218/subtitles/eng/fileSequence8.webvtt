00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:00.876 A:middle
Here's an example.

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.736 A:middle
Let's say I wanted this custom

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:04.956 A:middle
header view here to use a

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:07.176 A:middle
different color in light and

00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:07.956 A:middle
dark appearance.

00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:11.136 A:middle
Now, we already know in Xcode 10

00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:13.366 A:middle
I can go into the asset catalog

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:15.656 A:middle
editor and specify specific

00:08:15.656 --> 00:08:17.566 A:middle
color assets for light and dark.

00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:21.036 A:middle
But then how do I use that in my

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:21.676 A:middle
custom view?

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:24.866 A:middle
Well, here's one way that seems

00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:26.916 A:middle
tempting but won't work and I'll

00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:27.486 A:middle
show you why.

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:30.156 A:middle
First, we'll add an NSColor

00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:31.196 A:middle
property to our view.

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:34.916 A:middle
And in init, we'll use that

00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:37.736 A:middle
color to populate our layer.

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:41.606 A:middle
And if the color changes, we'll

00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:42.846 A:middle
go ahead and update our layer

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:43.316 A:middle
there too.

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:45.546 A:middle
Let's try that out.

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:48.356 A:middle
OK. It looks pretty good in

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:51.666 A:middle
light, but if we switch to dark,

00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:52.726 A:middle
we can see our color didn't

00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:53.786 A:middle
actually change.

00:08:55.016 --> 00:08:56.316 A:middle
And that's because even though

00:08:56.316 --> 00:08:59.016 A:middle
our NSColor is dynamic, the CG

00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.496 A:middle
color that we get from it is
