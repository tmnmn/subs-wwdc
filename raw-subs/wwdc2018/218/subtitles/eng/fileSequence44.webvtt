00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:00.646 A:middle
bitmap graphics contexts using

00:44:00.776 --> 00:44:02.036 A:middle
NSGraphicsContext or

00:44:02.036 --> 00:44:03.326 A:middle
CGBitmapContext.

00:44:03.876 --> 00:44:04.866 A:middle
And, depending on what you're

00:44:04.866 --> 00:44:06.546 A:middle
doing, these might also be great

00:44:06.546 --> 00:44:07.856 A:middle
candidates for replacing with a

00:44:07.856 --> 00:44:09.066 A:middle
block-based NSImage.

00:44:09.556 --> 00:44:11.796 A:middle
Further, if you're using the

00:44:11.796 --> 00:44:13.826 A:middle
NSView cacheDisplay in Rect

00:44:13.826 --> 00:44:15.676 A:middle
method to cache your image to a

00:44:15.676 --> 00:44:18.186 A:middle
bitmap rep, just be aware that

00:44:18.186 --> 00:44:19.356 A:middle
this method is not going to

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:20.656 A:middle
capture some of our more

00:44:21.006 --> 00:44:22.966 A:middle
advanced rendering techniques

00:44:22.966 --> 00:44:25.356 A:middle
like materials and blurs and

00:44:25.356 --> 00:44:26.466 A:middle
it's also just another way that

00:44:26.466 --> 00:44:27.546 A:middle
you can produce drawing that

00:44:27.546 --> 00:44:28.856 A:middle
goes stale when the appearance

00:44:28.856 --> 00:44:33.376 A:middle
changes, so be aware of that.

00:44:33.506 --> 00:44:34.426 A:middle
Here's another situation that

00:44:34.426 --> 00:44:35.366 A:middle
you might find yourself running

00:44:35.366 --> 00:44:35.676 A:middle
into.

00:44:36.996 --> 00:44:37.626 A:middle
If you have an

00:44:37.626 --> 00:44:38.826 A:middle
NSAttributedString or

00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:40.416 A:middle
NSTextStorage and you're

00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:41.806 A:middle
manipulating those attributes

00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:44.156 A:middle
manually-- say I am in this

00:44:44.156 --> 00:44:44.926 A:middle
case, I've just set my

00:44:44.926 --> 00:44:46.086 A:middle
attributes to just be a

00:44:46.086 --> 00:44:47.226 A:middle
dictionary with a font in it--

00:44:48.166 --> 00:44:48.816 A:middle
you might find that this

00:44:48.816 --> 00:44:49.316 A:middle
happens.

00:44:49.316 --> 00:44:51.496 A:middle
Your text is drawing black even

00:44:51.496 --> 00:44:52.596 A:middle
when you switch into Dark Mode

00:44:52.596 --> 00:44:53.526 A:middle
and what has happened here?

00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:56.286 A:middle
Well, we're missing a foreground

00:44:56.286 --> 00:44:58.536 A:middle
color attribute and when the

00:44:58.536 --> 00:45:00.136 A:middle
text drawing engine encounters a
