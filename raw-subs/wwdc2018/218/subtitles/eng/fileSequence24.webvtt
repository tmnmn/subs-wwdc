00:23:59.336 --> 00:24:00.806 A:middle
and then I'll set its fillColor

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:02.746 A:middle
to the underPageBackgroundColor.

00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:05.366 A:middle
Of course, I can also use

00:24:05.366 --> 00:24:06.986 A:middle
NSVisualEffectView, I can set

00:24:06.986 --> 00:24:08.506 A:middle
it's material property to the

00:24:08.506 --> 00:24:09.906 A:middle
underPageBackground material.

00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:11.296 A:middle
Now, the advantage of using

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.506 A:middle
NSBox is it's back-deployable

00:24:13.506 --> 00:24:15.416 A:middle
actually all the way back to

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:15.956 A:middle
Leopard.

00:24:17.076 --> 00:24:18.086 A:middle
VisualEffectView, on the other

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:19.086 A:middle
hand, gives you a little more

00:24:19.086 --> 00:24:21.346 A:middle
flexibility and I'll give you an

00:24:21.346 --> 00:24:22.246 A:middle
example of that later.

00:24:22.826 --> 00:24:26.906 A:middle
So, just as a reminder, these

00:24:26.906 --> 00:24:28.356 A:middle
materials will show their

00:24:28.496 --> 00:24:30.656 A:middle
untinted color in light.

00:24:31.156 --> 00:24:33.946 A:middle
And in dark, they'll show that

00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:35.026 A:middle
desktop-tinting effect.

00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:37.366 A:middle
But remember that the tint

00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:39.046 A:middle
effect can be disabled.

00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:40.026 A:middle
Let me show you why.

00:24:40.706 --> 00:24:45.826 A:middle
So, in Mojave, you can choose an

00:24:45.926 --> 00:24:47.376 A:middle
accent color for the system.

00:24:47.896 --> 00:24:52.276 A:middle
And if I switch this over to

00:24:52.386 --> 00:24:55.276 A:middle
graphite, you'll probably first

00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:56.696 A:middle
notice that all the controls

00:24:56.696 --> 00:24:59.806 A:middle
lost their colored accents, but
