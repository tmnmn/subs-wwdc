00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:00.336 A:middle
this is where you can override

00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:01.916 A:middle
the appearance for a particular

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:02.386 A:middle
object.

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.066 A:middle
Now, it's an optional

00:05:05.116 --> 00:05:07.696 A:middle
NSAppearance because, if you set

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:09.216 A:middle
it to nil, the object will

00:05:09.216 --> 00:05:10.716 A:middle
simply inherit its appearance

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:11.886 A:middle
from its ancestors.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:15.346 A:middle
There's also effective

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:17.356 A:middle
appearance and this is a

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:19.456 A:middle
read-only property that you can

00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:21.806 A:middle
use to find out what appearance

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:22.976 A:middle
a view will draw with.

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:26.986 A:middle
And of course, to use this,

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.346 A:middle
you'll have to get the right

00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:30.086 A:middle
NSAppearance object and you can

00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:32.216 A:middle
do that pretty easily using the

00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:34.456 A:middle
NSAppearance named initializer.

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:38.416 A:middle
Just pass aqua or darkAqua based

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:40.166 A:middle
on which appearance you want and

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:42.996 A:middle
then you can go ahead and just

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:44.396 A:middle
assign that to the appearance

00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:45.886 A:middle
property of the object that

00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:46.936 A:middle
you'd like to customize.

00:05:47.106 --> 00:05:49.046 A:middle
So, in this case, we'll assign

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:51.466 A:middle
the aqua appearance to the

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:52.826 A:middle
appearance property of the text

00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:54.416 A:middle
view and now it uses the light

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:54.996 A:middle
appearance.

00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:55.646 A:middle
All right.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.836 A:middle
That was pretty easy, so let's

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
take a look at another case.
