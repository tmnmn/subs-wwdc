00:17:57.946 --> 00:18:00.046 A:middle
Now, you've probably heard that

00:18:00.466 --> 00:18:02.636 A:middle
materials are one of the

00:18:02.636 --> 00:18:04.356 A:middle
building blocks of the modern

00:18:04.356 --> 00:18:06.146 A:middle
Mac UI, but you may have

00:18:06.146 --> 00:18:07.466 A:middle
wondered to yourself, well, what

00:18:07.466 --> 00:18:09.596 A:middle
exactly is a material, so let's

00:18:09.596 --> 00:18:10.586 A:middle
start with a definition.

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.436 A:middle
Materials are dynamic

00:18:13.496 --> 00:18:15.726 A:middle
backgrounds that make use of

00:18:15.726 --> 00:18:18.136 A:middle
effects like blurs, gradient,

00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:21.856 A:middle
tinting, translucency, and they

00:18:21.856 --> 00:18:24.276 A:middle
provide a sense of depth or

00:18:24.276 --> 00:18:26.806 A:middle
context to your UI, as well as

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.206 A:middle
just a bit of added beauty.

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:31.626 A:middle
Here's a pretty typical Mac

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.606 A:middle
desktop and you can see all the

00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:35.076 A:middle
different places where we're

00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:36.476 A:middle
using these material effects--

00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:37.896 A:middle
actually, this isn't even all of

00:18:37.896 --> 00:18:38.000 A:middle
them.

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.986 A:middle
Now, AppKit automatically

00:18:42.986 --> 00:18:44.936 A:middle
provides materials in a number

00:18:44.936 --> 00:18:47.096 A:middle
of common places, like the title

00:18:47.096 --> 00:18:49.166 A:middle
bars and backgrounds of windows,

00:18:49.986 --> 00:18:52.696 A:middle
table views, sidebars, popovers,

00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:55.246 A:middle
menus, and even other places as

00:18:56.016 --> 00:18:56.136 A:middle
well.

00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:58.366 A:middle
But you can create a material

00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
yourself and add it to your UI
