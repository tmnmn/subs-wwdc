00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
take a look at another case.

00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:04.626 A:middle
You might have a window that

00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:06.076 A:middle
kind of hangs off of a

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:07.026 A:middle
particular view.

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.306 A:middle
And you probably want its

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:11.236 A:middle
appearance to match the view it

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:12.016 A:middle
hangs off of.

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:15.196 A:middle
Now, we could just assign the

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:16.446 A:middle
aqua appearance to this window

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.756 A:middle
just like we did to the view,

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:20.316 A:middle
but what we really want is

00:06:20.616 --> 00:06:21.636 A:middle
something a little stronger.

00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:23.196 A:middle
We want its appearance to

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:26.576 A:middle
inherit from the view and we can

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:28.716 A:middle
do that-- first of all, AppKit

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.316 A:middle
will automatically do this for

00:06:30.316 --> 00:06:31.696 A:middle
us for a number of common

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:34.586 A:middle
windows, like menus, popovers,

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:36.546 A:middle
tool tips, and sheets, so you

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:37.456 A:middle
don't have to worry about it in

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:38.156 A:middle
those cases.

00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:40.966 A:middle
But, for custom cases like this,

00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:43.266 A:middle
there's new API in Mojave that

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:45.436 A:middle
you can use to do this.

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:48.256 A:middle
It's called Appearance Source.

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:51.746 A:middle
Now, this is a property that

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:54.446 A:middle
takes any object that conforms

00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:54.776 A:middle
to that

00:06:54.856 --> 00:06:55.976 A:middle
NSAppearanceCustomization

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:57.386 A:middle
protocol-- so, views and

00:06:57.386 --> 00:07:00.506 A:middle
windows-- and you just assign it
