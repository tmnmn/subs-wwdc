00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:01.956 A:middle
Now, in addition to being at the

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.976 A:middle
core of Dark Mode, we've already

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:05.426 A:middle
been using NSAppearance for

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:06.936 A:middle
several years and it's underlied

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.316 A:middle
[phonetic] such features as the

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:10.636 A:middle
high contrast mode of macOS as

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:12.376 A:middle
well as the touch bar UI

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.266 A:middle
designed specifically for that

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:15.266 A:middle
awesome piece of hardware.

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:20.056 A:middle
Now, previously we've had one

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:21.726 A:middle
main appearance, one main light

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.546 A:middle
appearance for aqua windows and

00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:24.226 A:middle
we called aqua.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:26.336 A:middle
And, of course, in 10.14, we're

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:27.806 A:middle
introducing a second appearance

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.636 A:middle
for aqua windows for Dark Mode

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:30.966 A:middle
called darkAqua.

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:33.916 A:middle
These objects contain all the

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.556 A:middle
assets that views draw with.

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:38.036 A:middle
So, any time you use system

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:39.886 A:middle
dynamic colors or standard

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.226 A:middle
effects or named images or even

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:43.606 A:middle
just standard Cocoa controls,

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:45.076 A:middle
this is where all that stuff is

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:45.746 A:middle
coming from.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:49.436 A:middle
And AppKit will automatically

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:51.486 A:middle
provide appearances for all of

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:53.646 A:middle
you views and windows based on

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:55.136 A:middle
the user's light/dark preference

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.796 A:middle
in system preferences once you

00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:59.326 A:middle
link on the macOS 10.14 SDK.
