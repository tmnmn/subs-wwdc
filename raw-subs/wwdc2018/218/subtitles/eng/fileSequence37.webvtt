00:36:58.826 --> 00:37:00.106 A:middle
Mode, everything just works.

00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:01.026 A:middle
We don't have to do anything

00:37:01.026 --> 00:37:04.466 A:middle
special to support that.

00:37:04.466 --> 00:37:05.846 A:middle
One final note on selections.

00:37:06.906 --> 00:37:08.736 A:middle
The selection material that you

00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:10.966 A:middle
commonly see in sidebars, menus,

00:37:10.966 --> 00:37:13.696 A:middle
and popovers now follows the

00:37:13.696 --> 00:37:15.086 A:middle
accent color preference on

00:37:15.086 --> 00:37:15.546 A:middle
Mojave.

00:37:16.186 --> 00:37:17.226 A:middle
And what that means is that if

00:37:17.226 --> 00:37:18.446 A:middle
you're drawing a custom blue

00:37:18.446 --> 00:37:20.116 A:middle
selection, it's not going to fit

00:37:20.116 --> 00:37:20.326 A:middle
in.

00:37:21.426 --> 00:37:22.436 A:middle
Instead, you should use

00:37:22.436 --> 00:37:23.446 A:middle
NSVisualEffectView.

00:37:23.756 --> 00:37:24.826 A:middle
It has a special selection

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:26.726 A:middle
material just for this and when

00:37:26.726 --> 00:37:27.696 A:middle
you use this it's going to

00:37:27.696 --> 00:37:28.666 A:middle
automatically follow the

00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:30.000 A:middle
preference, as you expect.

00:37:33.716 --> 00:37:35.476 A:middle
Now, before I get into the

00:37:35.476 --> 00:37:36.676 A:middle
exciting part, the tips and the

00:37:36.676 --> 00:37:38.156 A:middle
tricks, I want to say a couple

00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:39.316 A:middle
of words about backward

00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:40.996 A:middle
deployment because we know that

00:37:40.996 --> 00:37:42.446 A:middle
many of you, especially on the

00:37:42.446 --> 00:37:43.856 A:middle
Mac, like to deploy your

00:37:43.856 --> 00:37:45.256 A:middle
applications back to previous

00:37:45.256 --> 00:37:47.016 A:middle
releases of macOS and it was

00:37:47.016 --> 00:37:48.086 A:middle
important to us to make sure

00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:49.446 A:middle
that you could adopt Dark Mode

00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:51.456 A:middle
without necessarily compromising

00:37:51.456 --> 00:37:52.456 A:middle
on your backward deployment.

00:37:52.976 --> 00:37:55.136 A:middle
And so I'm going to step through

00:37:55.136 --> 00:37:56.186 A:middle
a couple of APIs and just

00:37:56.186 --> 00:37:57.146 A:middle
examine them for backward

00:37:57.146 --> 00:37:58.576 A:middle
deployment, starting with system

00:37:58.576 --> 00:37:59.076 A:middle
colors.

00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:00.856 A:middle
So, here's a sampling of the
