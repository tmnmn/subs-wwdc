00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:02.056 A:middle
So, here's our beautiful

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.786 A:middle
Chameleon Wrangler app that

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:06.916 A:middle
Rachel and Taylor created in the

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:08.646 A:middle
intro session and you can see

00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:10.096 A:middle
once we linked it on the macOS

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:13.046 A:middle
10.14 SDK, AppKit went ahead and

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:14.506 A:middle
automatically gave it the

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:15.526 A:middle
darkAqua appearance.

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:18.196 A:middle
Now, that's great, but what if

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.315 A:middle
we want to change the

00:04:19.315 --> 00:04:20.005 A:middle
appearance?

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:22.106 A:middle
For example, what if we wanted

00:04:22.676 --> 00:04:25.266 A:middle
to change the appearance of this

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:25.986 A:middle
notes view?

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:29.136 A:middle
We might think that in the dark

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:30.946 A:middle
appearance we still might want

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:32.636 A:middle
the notes view to appear light.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.626 A:middle
Well, you can do that using

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:37.146 A:middle
something called

00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:38.786 A:middle
NSAppearanceCustomization.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:41.026 A:middle
Now, this is a protocol, but

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:42.386 A:middle
it's not a protocol you have to

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:43.616 A:middle
go off and adopt in your

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.376 A:middle
applications.

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.486 A:middle
It's already adopted by NSView

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:50.226 A:middle
and NSWindow and, in Mojave,

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:52.116 A:middle
NSApplication conforms as well.

00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:54.556 A:middle
It's a pretty simple protocol.

00:04:54.706 --> 00:04:55.956 A:middle
It just adds two properties.

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:58.946 A:middle
First property is appearance and

00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:00.336 A:middle
this is where you can override
