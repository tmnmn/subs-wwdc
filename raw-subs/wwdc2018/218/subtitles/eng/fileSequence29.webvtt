00:28:58.996 --> 00:29:00.786 A:middle
And it's in a popover, which

00:29:00.786 --> 00:29:01.806 A:middle
means that it's automatically

00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:03.846 A:middle
getting that awesome popover

00:29:03.846 --> 00:29:04.746 A:middle
material backing.

00:29:05.256 --> 00:29:07.636 A:middle
And what we want when we're

00:29:07.636 --> 00:29:08.676 A:middle
drawing over this backing

00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:10.576 A:middle
material is for our content to

00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:12.236 A:middle
really stand out on top of that

00:29:12.236 --> 00:29:13.166 A:middle
varied background.

00:29:13.776 --> 00:29:14.736 A:middle
Something like this.

00:29:15.256 --> 00:29:16.706 A:middle
And we do that with an effect

00:29:16.706 --> 00:29:17.806 A:middle
that we call vibrancy.

00:29:18.386 --> 00:29:20.456 A:middle
So, what is vibrancy?

00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:22.996 A:middle
It's a blending mode that we

00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:24.456 A:middle
apply to the content that

00:29:24.456 --> 00:29:26.266 A:middle
uniformly lightens or darkens

00:29:26.266 --> 00:29:28.326 A:middle
the content behind it.

00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:30.136 A:middle
It's very similar to a color

00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:31.266 A:middle
dodge or burn that you might

00:29:31.266 --> 00:29:32.516 A:middle
have seen in your favorite photo

00:29:32.516 --> 00:29:33.746 A:middle
editor or design tool.

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:35.686 A:middle
But let's take a closer look.

00:29:36.726 --> 00:29:38.226 A:middle
Here we have a glyph that's

00:29:38.226 --> 00:29:39.716 A:middle
drawing in about a medium gray,

00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:42.296 A:middle
about a 50% gray, but at 100%

00:29:42.296 --> 00:29:42.876 A:middle
opacity.

00:29:44.206 --> 00:29:45.706 A:middle
And when we apply the vibrant

00:29:45.706 --> 00:29:47.296 A:middle
blending effect that we use

00:29:47.296 --> 00:29:48.896 A:middle
against dark materials, which we

00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:51.606 A:middle
call a lightening effect, we can

00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:53.256 A:middle
see that it's not that the

00:29:53.256 --> 00:29:54.586 A:middle
opacity has dropped on our

00:29:54.586 --> 00:29:55.686 A:middle
glyph, but we're actually

00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:57.586 A:middle
lightening the content behind it

00:29:58.066 --> 00:29:59.626 A:middle
using the lightness of that gray

00:29:59.626 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
value.

00:29:59.976 --> 00:30:03.366 A:middle
And in fact, when we look at how
