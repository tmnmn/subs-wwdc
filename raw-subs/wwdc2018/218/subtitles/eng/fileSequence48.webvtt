00:47:59.436 --> 00:48:01.116 A:middle
and light variants, and we can

00:48:01.116 --> 00:48:03.116 A:middle
preview them in the canvas live.

00:48:03.696 --> 00:48:04.776 A:middle
And if you see there's a little

00:48:04.776 --> 00:48:05.966 A:middle
arrow button built into that

00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:07.156 A:middle
pop-up button and you can use

00:48:07.156 --> 00:48:08.096 A:middle
that to follow it and go

00:48:08.096 --> 00:48:09.396 A:middle
straight to the definition in

00:48:09.396 --> 00:48:10.936 A:middle
your asset catalog, so you can

00:48:10.936 --> 00:48:12.866 A:middle
see live as you're changing it.

00:48:13.816 --> 00:48:15.106 A:middle
And you can do this all without

00:48:15.106 --> 00:48:16.416 A:middle
even building and recompiling.

00:48:16.456 --> 00:48:18.136 A:middle
When you do build and run,

00:48:18.136 --> 00:48:20.646 A:middle
you're going to see a new item

00:48:20.646 --> 00:48:22.646 A:middle
in your Debug Bar and it

00:48:22.646 --> 00:48:24.056 A:middle
produces a menu that allows you

00:48:24.056 --> 00:48:25.016 A:middle
to choose the appearance for

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:25.766 A:middle
your application.

00:48:26.446 --> 00:48:27.636 A:middle
And this is really handy for

00:48:27.636 --> 00:48:29.096 A:middle
previewing your app in various

00:48:29.096 --> 00:48:30.746 A:middle
appearances without having to go

00:48:30.746 --> 00:48:31.966 A:middle
and reconfigure your entire

00:48:31.966 --> 00:48:32.426 A:middle
system.

00:48:33.686 --> 00:48:34.886 A:middle
Not only can you choose light

00:48:34.886 --> 00:48:36.056 A:middle
and dark, but you can also

00:48:36.056 --> 00:48:37.066 A:middle
choose the high contrast

00:48:37.066 --> 00:48:38.996 A:middle
variants and test those as well.

00:48:40.146 --> 00:48:41.276 A:middle
And, if you have a Touch Bar

00:48:41.276 --> 00:48:42.796 A:middle
Mac, this appears in the

00:48:42.796 --> 00:48:44.476 A:middle
expanded Debug Bar as well, so

00:48:44.476 --> 00:48:45.566 A:middle
you can do this without even

00:48:45.566 --> 00:48:47.156 A:middle
leaving your app to go back to

00:48:47.746 --> 00:48:48.000 A:middle
Xcode.

00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:51.326 A:middle
Finally, I want to talk about

00:48:51.326 --> 00:48:53.176 A:middle
one last tool in Xcode that is

00:48:53.176 --> 00:48:54.326 A:middle
really great for debugging your

00:48:54.326 --> 00:48:55.426 A:middle
Dark Mode applications.

00:48:56.346 --> 00:48:58.676 A:middle
So, here we have our app and

00:48:58.676 --> 00:48:59.766 A:middle
really things are looking pretty

00:48:59.766 --> 00:48:59.996 A:middle
good.

00:48:59.996 --> 00:49:01.536 A:middle
There's nothing out of place,
