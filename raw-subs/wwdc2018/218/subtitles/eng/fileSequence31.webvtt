00:30:58.676 --> 00:31:00.086 A:middle
Not only do they include the

00:31:00.086 --> 00:31:01.786 A:middle
exact formula that we use for

00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:03.236 A:middle
that lightening or darkening

00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:05.306 A:middle
effect, but they also have a set

00:31:05.306 --> 00:31:06.876 A:middle
of control artwork and color

00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:07.806 A:middle
definitions that have been

00:31:07.806 --> 00:31:09.596 A:middle
designed to work great with that

00:31:09.636 --> 00:31:10.126 A:middle
blend mode.

00:31:10.646 --> 00:31:13.426 A:middle
But how does your code use it?

00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:15.436 A:middle
Well, it's very simple.

00:31:16.356 --> 00:31:18.286 A:middle
In your NSView subclass, you can

00:31:18.286 --> 00:31:19.676 A:middle
override the allowsVibrancy

00:31:19.676 --> 00:31:22.206 A:middle
property to return true and the

00:31:22.206 --> 00:31:23.206 A:middle
blending effect is going to

00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:24.546 A:middle
automatically apply to your

00:31:24.546 --> 00:31:25.906 A:middle
views drawing and also the

00:31:25.906 --> 00:31:27.456 A:middle
drawing of all of its

00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:28.000 A:middle
descendants.

00:31:29.946 --> 00:31:31.046 A:middle
Typically, when you're drawing

00:31:31.046 --> 00:31:33.116 A:middle
in this vibrant context, you

00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:34.566 A:middle
want to use one of the built-in

00:31:34.566 --> 00:31:35.886 A:middle
label colors, depending on the

00:31:35.886 --> 00:31:37.166 A:middle
prominence of your content.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:38.976 A:middle
Both vibrantDark and

00:31:38.976 --> 00:31:39.896 A:middle
vibrantLight have great

00:31:39.896 --> 00:31:41.166 A:middle
definitions for all four of

00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:42.636 A:middle
these colors that allow you to

00:31:42.636 --> 00:31:44.036 A:middle
establish that nice hierarchy.

00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:46.616 A:middle
However, you don't have to use

00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:47.176 A:middle
these colors.

00:31:47.176 --> 00:31:48.696 A:middle
You can use any color that you'd

00:31:48.696 --> 00:31:50.336 A:middle
like, but we prefer to use

00:31:50.336 --> 00:31:51.866 A:middle
non-grayscale colors.

00:31:52.546 --> 00:31:53.936 A:middle
Avoid non-grayscale colors

00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:55.736 A:middle
because, if you use them, the

00:31:56.126 --> 00:31:57.696 A:middle
blending effect is going to

00:31:57.746 --> 00:31:59.696 A:middle
impact the design intent of your

00:31:59.696 --> 00:32:00.876 A:middle
color and it's going to wash it
