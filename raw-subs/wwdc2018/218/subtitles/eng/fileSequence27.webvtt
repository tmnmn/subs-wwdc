00:27:00.466 --> 00:27:01.896 A:middle
So, I'll go back to my view,

00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:04.736 A:middle
I'll override layout, and I'll

00:27:04.736 --> 00:27:05.816 A:middle
go ahead and add a

00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:06.816 A:middle
VisualEffectView.

00:27:07.896 --> 00:27:09.716 A:middle
I'll set its material to the

00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:11.786 A:middle
contentBackground material, and

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:14.616 A:middle
then I'll create a drawing

00:27:14.616 --> 00:27:17.176 A:middle
handler image using the NSImage

00:27:17.356 --> 00:27:19.816 A:middle
size flipped initializer that

00:27:19.816 --> 00:27:20.516 A:middle
takes a block.

00:27:22.076 --> 00:27:24.306 A:middle
In it, I'll set the white

00:27:24.416 --> 00:27:25.686 A:middle
color-- this color doesn't

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:27.056 A:middle
really matter as long as its

00:27:27.056 --> 00:27:27.426 A:middle
opaque.

00:27:27.426 --> 00:27:29.426 A:middle
And then I'll go ahead and fill

00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:32.796 A:middle
with my path.

00:27:32.956 --> 00:27:34.956 A:middle
Then I'll set that image ask the

00:27:34.956 --> 00:27:36.146 A:middle
maskImage on my

00:27:36.146 --> 00:27:36.846 A:middle
VisualEffectView.

00:27:37.676 --> 00:27:39.006 A:middle
All right.

00:27:39.276 --> 00:27:41.606 A:middle
Let's look at it now.

00:27:41.846 --> 00:27:42.666 A:middle
Looks a lot better.

00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:44.626 A:middle
It's desktop-tinted.

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:47.936 A:middle
And, if we look side by side, we

00:27:47.936 --> 00:27:51.476 A:middle
can really see the difference.

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:53.356 A:middle
So, this technique works with

00:27:53.466 --> 00:27:55.626 A:middle
any material, but just remember

00:27:55.626 --> 00:27:57.256 A:middle
that only the alpha channel of

00:27:57.256 --> 00:27:58.596 A:middle
the image is used for the mask.

00:27:58.726 --> 00:27:59.976 A:middle
This is similar to template

00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:00.496 A:middle
images.
