00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:02.066 A:middle
I'll override this new

00:16:02.266 --> 00:16:03.206 A:middle
viewDidChange

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:05.966 A:middle
EffectiveAppearance method and

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.416 A:middle
I'll set my sublayer

00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:08.176 A:middle
needsDisplay.

00:16:08.986 --> 00:16:10.626 A:middle
Now, if I didn't do this, my

00:16:10.626 --> 00:16:12.586 A:middle
sublayer wouldn't update when my

00:16:12.586 --> 00:16:13.626 A:middle
view's effective appearance

00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:14.066 A:middle
changed.

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:15.106 A:middle
It would just stay the same.

00:16:15.136 --> 00:16:19.096 A:middle
And then in my layer delegate

00:16:19.096 --> 00:16:21.106 A:middle
routine, I'll save off the

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:22.996 A:middle
current appearance for later and

00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:24.546 A:middle
then I'll go ahead and set the

00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:26.286 A:middle
current appearance to my view's

00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:27.376 A:middle
effective appearance.

00:16:27.906 --> 00:16:31.276 A:middle
Then I can go ahead and update

00:16:31.276 --> 00:16:31.706 A:middle
my layer.

00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:34.306 A:middle
Now, if I hadn't set the current

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:36.316 A:middle
appearance before this, this

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:38.016 A:middle
code wouldn't be using my view's

00:16:38.016 --> 00:16:39.456 A:middle
appearance and so it would end

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:40.346 A:middle
up looking wrong.

00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:42.956 A:middle
Finally, when I'm done, I'll

00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:44.626 A:middle
just restore the old current

00:16:44.626 --> 00:16:45.136 A:middle
appearance.

00:16:48.726 --> 00:16:49.826 A:middle
Here's another thing to be aware

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:51.676 A:middle
of if you're managing layers.

00:16:52.686 --> 00:16:54.036 A:middle
You might have code that looks

00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:55.696 A:middle
like one of these two examples.

00:16:56.296 --> 00:16:57.506 A:middle
Either you're setting the

00:16:57.506 --> 00:16:59.306 A:middle
contents of a layer to an

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:01.896 A:middle
NSImage or you're using the
