00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:00.916 A:middle
switch on effectiveAppearance

00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:05.286 A:middle
bestMatch(from:, I'll pass an

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:06.796 A:middle
array with all of the appearance

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:08.576 A:middle
names that my view happens to

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:08.916 A:middle
know about.

00:11:08.976 --> 00:11:11.276 A:middle
In this case, aqua and darkAqua.

00:11:11.806 --> 00:11:14.326 A:middle
Then it's just a matter of

00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:16.606 A:middle
implementing behavior for each

00:11:16.606 --> 00:11:17.416 A:middle
of those appearances.

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:19.366 A:middle
So, for the aqua appearance,

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:21.616 A:middle
I'll simply use my imageView

00:11:21.616 --> 00:11:23.856 A:middle
with Chloe's face as a subview.

00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:27.856 A:middle
And for darkAqua, I'll not only

00:11:27.856 --> 00:11:28.786 A:middle
use that imageView, but I'll

00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:30.946 A:middle
also through my glowView behind

00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:31.606 A:middle
it.

00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:35.766 A:middle
Finally, I'll implement a

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:38.146 A:middle
default case and this is for

00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:40.266 A:middle
appearances my view doesn't know

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:41.586 A:middle
about and that includes

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:43.006 A:middle
potential appearances Apple

00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:44.026 A:middle
might come out with in the

00:11:44.086 --> 00:11:44.436 A:middle
future.

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:45.176 A:middle
OK.

00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:47.536 A:middle
Let's take a look at what it

00:11:47.536 --> 00:11:48.236 A:middle
looks like.

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:50.696 A:middle
So, there it is in light, no

00:11:50.696 --> 00:11:52.106 A:middle
glow, that's what we wanted.

00:11:52.836 --> 00:11:54.696 A:middle
Switch to dark and we have that

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:55.006 A:middle
glow.

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:55.666 A:middle
That's great.

00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:56.266 A:middle
All right.

00:11:58.116 --> 00:11:59.596 A:middle
Let's talk for a minute about

00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:00.746 A:middle
high contrast.
