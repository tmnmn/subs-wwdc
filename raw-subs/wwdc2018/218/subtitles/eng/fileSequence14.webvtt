00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:03.316 A:middle
Primarily, you need to know that

00:14:03.566 --> 00:14:05.466 A:middle
custom sublayers will not

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:07.066 A:middle
inherit your view's appearance

00:14:07.156 --> 00:14:07.936 A:middle
automatically.

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:12.456 A:middle
Now, the easiest fix for this is

00:14:12.536 --> 00:14:13.656 A:middle
to switch them from being

00:14:13.726 --> 00:14:15.476 A:middle
sublayers to subviews.

00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:17.606 A:middle
If you do that, AppKit will

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.056 A:middle
automatically handle the

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:22.096 A:middle
appearance inheritance for those

00:14:22.096 --> 00:14:23.826 A:middle
views, just like any other view.

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:27.186 A:middle
Otherwise, you'll have to manage

00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:29.136 A:middle
those layers manually using a

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:30.266 A:middle
couple techniques that I'll talk

00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:31.866 A:middle
about now, viewDidChange

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:33.686 A:middle
EffectiveAppearance and the

00:14:33.686 --> 00:14:35.076 A:middle
concept of the current

00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:35.576 A:middle
appearance.

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:39.856 A:middle
So, first viewDidChange

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:40.996 A:middle
EffectiveAppearance.

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:43.886 A:middle
This is a new method on NSView

00:14:44.186 --> 00:14:47.226 A:middle
that you can override to find

00:14:47.226 --> 00:14:48.896 A:middle
out when your view's effective

00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:49.746 A:middle
appearance changes.

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:52.246 A:middle
Now, this is a good time to

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.906 A:middle
perform any custom invalidation

00:14:53.906 --> 00:14:56.276 A:middle
you might need to do or drop any

00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:57.426 A:middle
caches that are no longer

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:57.826 A:middle
relevant.

00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
But remember you don't need to
