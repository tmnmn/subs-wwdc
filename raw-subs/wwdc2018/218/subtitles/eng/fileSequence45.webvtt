00:44:58.536 --> 00:45:00.136 A:middle
text drawing engine encounters a

00:45:00.136 --> 00:45:01.956 A:middle
range of attributed strings that

00:45:02.006 --> 00:45:02.956 A:middle
doesn't have a foreground

00:45:02.956 --> 00:45:04.956 A:middle
attribute, it defaults to black.

00:45:04.956 --> 00:45:06.596 A:middle
And this is what it has always

00:45:06.596 --> 00:45:08.006 A:middle
defaulted to and it's going to

00:45:08.006 --> 00:45:09.296 A:middle
continue to be the default for

00:45:09.296 --> 00:45:10.016 A:middle
compatibility.

00:45:11.036 --> 00:45:12.596 A:middle
So, one way to fix this is to

00:45:12.596 --> 00:45:13.586 A:middle
set a foreground color

00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:15.726 A:middle
explicitly to one of our dynamic

00:45:15.726 --> 00:45:17.436 A:middle
system colors, and that's going

00:45:17.436 --> 00:45:18.236 A:middle
to do what you expect.

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:21.596 A:middle
But a better alternative is that

00:45:21.596 --> 00:45:22.596 A:middle
if you're doing manual

00:45:22.596 --> 00:45:24.196 A:middle
attributed string drawing, you

00:45:24.196 --> 00:45:25.776 A:middle
should switch to a Cocoa

00:45:25.776 --> 00:45:27.256 A:middle
control, like an NSTextField,

00:45:27.536 --> 00:45:28.426 A:middle
which does this for you

00:45:28.426 --> 00:45:30.876 A:middle
automatically, or, if you're

00:45:30.876 --> 00:45:32.386 A:middle
manipulating the storage of a

00:45:32.386 --> 00:45:36.376 A:middle
textView, we have new API called

00:45:36.376 --> 00:45:38.256 A:middle
performValidatedReplacement on

00:45:38.256 --> 00:45:40.256 A:middle
textView that does a nice thing

00:45:40.256 --> 00:45:40.636 A:middle
for you.

00:45:40.966 --> 00:45:42.846 A:middle
If you go ahead and replace a

00:45:43.026 --> 00:45:45.336 A:middle
string with an attributed string

00:45:45.336 --> 00:45:47.976 A:middle
in your textView, it will fill

00:45:47.976 --> 00:45:50.336 A:middle
in any missing attributes with

00:45:50.406 --> 00:45:51.456 A:middle
the typing attributes from the

00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:54.666 A:middle
textView, so that way you can go

00:45:54.666 --> 00:45:55.776 A:middle
ahead and specify your new

00:45:55.776 --> 00:45:56.936 A:middle
attributed string without having

00:45:57.036 --> 00:45:58.776 A:middle
to manually merge all your

00:45:58.776 --> 00:46:00.000 A:middle
attributes together.
