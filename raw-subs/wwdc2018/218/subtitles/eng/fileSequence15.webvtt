00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
But remember you don't need to

00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:02.136 A:middle
invalidate the view itself here,

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:03.736 A:middle
AppKit will do that for you

00:15:03.776 --> 00:15:04.546 A:middle
automatically.

00:15:07.236 --> 00:15:08.676 A:middle
Second, the concept of the

00:15:08.896 --> 00:15:09.726 A:middle
current appearance.

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:12.796 A:middle
Now, this is a thread local

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:14.766 A:middle
variable that you can access

00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:16.076 A:middle
through a class property on

00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:16.976 A:middle
NSAppearance.

00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:20.196 A:middle
If you're familiar with concepts

00:15:20.196 --> 00:15:21.576 A:middle
like the current NSGraphics

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:22.836 A:middle
context or the current

00:15:22.836 --> 00:15:24.516 A:middle
NSProgress, you already know

00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:25.516 A:middle
what I'm talking about.

00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:27.836 A:middle
If not, just remember that this

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:29.416 A:middle
is the appearance used to

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:31.476 A:middle
resolve dynamic colors and

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:32.326 A:middle
images.

00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:35.856 A:middle
AppKit will set up the current

00:15:35.856 --> 00:15:37.386 A:middle
appearance automatically for you

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:39.146 A:middle
before we call any of those

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:40.866 A:middle
special NSView methods we talked

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:41.806 A:middle
about before, like

00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:44.286 A:middle
updateConstraints, layout, draw,

00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:47.116 A:middle
and updateLayer, but you can

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:49.076 A:middle
also set it up yourself where

00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:50.656 A:middle
necessary and let's take a look

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:51.796 A:middle
at an example why you might do

00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:52.046 A:middle
that.

00:15:55.396 --> 00:15:57.146 A:middle
So, here's a custom that

00:15:57.146 --> 00:15:58.576 A:middle
maintains some sublayers.
