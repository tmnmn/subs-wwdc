00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.426 A:middle
instead of static or hardcoded

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:00.966 A:middle
colors.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.406 A:middle
Making correct use of template

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:04.796 A:middle
images and materials.

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:07.516 A:middle
And, most of all, making use of

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:09.876 A:middle
the new features in Xcode 10 to

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.966 A:middle
define custom color and image

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.046 A:middle
assets specifically for Dark

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:14.216 A:middle
Mode.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:17.636 A:middle
Now, if you need a review on any

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:18.726 A:middle
of those topics, I highly

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:20.236 A:middle
recommend going back and

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:21.406 A:middle
watching the intro session on

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:22.026 A:middle
video later.

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:27.296 A:middle
Now, most UI will look great in

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.686 A:middle
Dark Mode using just those

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:29.266 A:middle
techniques.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.386 A:middle
In fact, some of our system apps

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:32.796 A:middle
required no other changes.

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:33.326 A:middle
It was great.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.016 A:middle
But we know some cases will

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:37.436 A:middle
require a little bit more work

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:38.626 A:middle
and that's what we're going to

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:39.686 A:middle
get into in this session.

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:46.266 A:middle
We're going to cover six main

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:46.956 A:middle
areas today.

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:49.806 A:middle
First, the appearance system,

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.826 A:middle
how it works, and how you can

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:53.086 A:middle
make use of it in your custom

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:53.596 A:middle
views.

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:57.236 A:middle
Second, materials, what they

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:59.406 A:middle
are, and how you can best make

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:01.836 A:middle
use of them in your UI.
