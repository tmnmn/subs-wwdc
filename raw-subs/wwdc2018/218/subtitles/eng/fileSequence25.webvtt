00:25:00.116 --> 00:25:01.646 A:middle
those desktop-tinted materials

00:25:01.796 --> 00:25:03.166 A:middle
also lost their tint.

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:06.476 A:middle
So, just make sure you're not

00:25:06.476 --> 00:25:07.866 A:middle
depending on that tint being

00:25:07.866 --> 00:25:11.866 A:middle
there in any way.

00:25:12.106 --> 00:25:16.036 A:middle
Now, VisualEffectView by default

00:25:16.336 --> 00:25:18.226 A:middle
will show its material in its

00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:19.536 A:middle
frame rectangle like this.

00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:20.886 A:middle
And that's pretty great, but

00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:23.046 A:middle
what if I wanted to show a

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:24.586 A:middle
custom UI element with this

00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.476 A:middle
material, like say a chat

00:25:26.476 --> 00:25:26.796 A:middle
bubble.

00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:28.086 A:middle
How would I do that?

00:25:29.276 --> 00:25:32.016 A:middle
Well, here's one way that seems

00:25:32.016 --> 00:25:33.496 A:middle
tempting, but won't work, and

00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:34.176 A:middle
I'll show you why.

00:25:35.606 --> 00:25:38.276 A:middle
We'll first implement the draw

00:25:38.276 --> 00:25:42.226 A:middle
method on NSView and then I'll

00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:44.436 A:middle
go get my custom chat bubble

00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:45.426 A:middle
BezierPath.

00:25:45.936 --> 00:25:48.716 A:middle
And then I'll fill with the

00:25:48.716 --> 00:25:51.926 A:middle
controlBackgroundColor in that

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:52.806 A:middle
path.

00:25:53.016 --> 00:25:54.916 A:middle
Now, if you do that, you'll find

00:25:54.916 --> 00:25:56.486 A:middle
it looks something like this and

00:25:56.486 --> 00:25:58.796 A:middle
it looks pretty good, but if we

00:25:58.796 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
zoom in closely, you'll see that
