00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:00.496 A:middle
images.

00:28:01.386 --> 00:28:03.886 A:middle
And the mask only masks the

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:06.626 A:middle
material, not any subviews or

00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:07.926 A:middle
other descendent views of the

00:28:07.926 --> 00:28:08.696 A:middle
VisualEffectView.

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:12.516 A:middle
A common technique is to provide

00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:15.156 A:middle
a resizable image for this-- for

00:28:15.156 --> 00:28:16.406 A:middle
the maskImage using the

00:28:16.406 --> 00:28:18.246 A:middle
capInsets and resizingMode

00:28:18.246 --> 00:28:19.796 A:middle
properties of NSImage.

00:28:20.206 --> 00:28:22.046 A:middle
And this is really good for

00:28:22.046 --> 00:28:22.706 A:middle
performance.

00:28:24.176 --> 00:28:24.496 A:middle
OK.

00:28:24.646 --> 00:28:25.846 A:middle
With that, I'll hand it off to

00:28:25.846 --> 00:28:26.886 A:middle
Jeff, who is going to talk about

00:28:26.886 --> 00:28:27.856 A:middle
vibrant blending.

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:30.996 --> 00:28:31.316 A:middle
Jeff.

00:28:33.336 --> 00:28:33.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:28:33.726 --> 00:28:34.436 A:middle
Thank you, Matt.

00:28:35.466 --> 00:28:36.506 A:middle
So, now that we've had a look at

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.076 A:middle
our great materials, I want to

00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:39.666 A:middle
cover the things that we draw in

00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:40.906 A:middle
front of those materials,

00:28:41.446 --> 00:28:42.646 A:middle
particularly the materials that

00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:44.696 A:middle
we use that pull in part of the

00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:46.466 A:middle
background and provide that

00:28:46.466 --> 00:28:47.626 A:middle
really awesome blur effect.

00:28:48.786 --> 00:28:50.846 A:middle
So, if we revisit our Chameleon

00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:52.786 A:middle
Wrangler application, we have

00:28:52.786 --> 00:28:53.916 A:middle
this UI here, it's our

00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:54.756 A:middle
mood-o-meter.

00:28:54.756 --> 00:28:56.156 A:middle
It's where we go to record how

00:28:56.156 --> 00:28:57.836 A:middle
our various reptiles are

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:58.226 A:middle
feeling.

00:28:58.996 --> 00:29:00.786 A:middle
And it's in a popover, which
