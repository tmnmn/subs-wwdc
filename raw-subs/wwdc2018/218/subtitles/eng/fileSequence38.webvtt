00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:00.856 A:middle
So, here's a sampling of the

00:38:00.856 --> 00:38:02.186 A:middle
system colors that we support

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:03.146 A:middle
that are dynamic for the

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:03.686 A:middle
appearance.

00:38:04.006 --> 00:38:05.076 A:middle
And what I want to highlight

00:38:05.076 --> 00:38:06.446 A:middle
here is that the ones

00:38:06.446 --> 00:38:07.586 A:middle
highlighted in green have been

00:38:07.586 --> 00:38:10.406 A:middle
available since at least 10.10

00:38:10.406 --> 00:38:12.076 A:middle
Yosemite, many of them actually

00:38:12.076 --> 00:38:12.896 A:middle
far further back.

00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:15.426 A:middle
And that means that we think

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:17.166 A:middle
that you have a great vocabulary

00:38:17.166 --> 00:38:18.416 A:middle
of colors available to you to

00:38:18.416 --> 00:38:20.046 A:middle
describe more or less any UI

00:38:20.046 --> 00:38:22.206 A:middle
that you'd like and that all

00:38:22.206 --> 00:38:23.936 A:middle
supports backward deployment out

00:38:23.936 --> 00:38:24.586 A:middle
of the box.

00:38:26.336 --> 00:38:28.266 A:middle
For custom colors, our modern

00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:29.576 A:middle
preferred solution for defining

00:38:29.576 --> 00:38:32.146 A:middle
them is asset catalogs and these

00:38:32.146 --> 00:38:33.936 A:middle
are available back to 10.13.

00:38:35.326 --> 00:38:37.376 A:middle
Now, when you do specify dark

00:38:37.646 --> 00:38:39.276 A:middle
variants for any of your assets,

00:38:39.596 --> 00:38:41.246 A:middle
when you back deploy them, those

00:38:41.246 --> 00:38:42.776 A:middle
dark variants are safely ignored

00:38:42.776 --> 00:38:43.816 A:middle
on previous versions of the

00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:45.786 A:middle
operating system, so that's a--

00:38:45.786 --> 00:38:46.996 A:middle
that's a solution that has

00:38:47.036 --> 00:38:48.156 A:middle
backward deployment built right

00:38:48.156 --> 00:38:48.336 A:middle
in.

00:38:49.116 --> 00:38:50.126 A:middle
But if you want to deploy back

00:38:50.126 --> 00:38:52.556 A:middle
further than 10.13, you can use

00:38:52.556 --> 00:38:55.256 A:middle
a technique like this where you

00:38:55.396 --> 00:38:56.776 A:middle
write a custom color property.

00:38:57.826 --> 00:38:59.386 A:middle
And here we just encapsulate the

00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:01.116 A:middle
availability check to use our
