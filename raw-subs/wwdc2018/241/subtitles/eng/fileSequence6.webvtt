00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
properties mentioned earlier.

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.186 A:middle
The two properties in the

00:06:03.186 --> 00:06:04.966 A:middle
protocol are accessibilityDrag

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:05.916 A:middle
SourceDescriptors and

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:07.686 A:middle
PointDescriptors.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.276 A:middle
DragSourceDescriptors is used to

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:13.056 A:middle
expose drag sources that are

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.416 A:middle
logically associated with an

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.736 A:middle
element and DropPointDescriptors

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.966 A:middle
exposes places to drop that are

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.066 A:middle
logically associated with this

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:20.516 A:middle
element.

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:22.506 A:middle
These are the properties you use

00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:23.956 A:middle
to describe to Accessibility

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.646 A:middle
what can be dragged from and

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:27.396 A:middle
dropped into a given element.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:30.496 A:middle
One important point to be aware

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:31.856 A:middle
of is that the descriptors must

00:06:31.856 --> 00:06:33.336 A:middle
reference the View that actually

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
has the interaction.

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.216 A:middle
So, for instance, you shouldn't

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:37.676 A:middle
reference a point in your window

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:38.966 A:middle
that happens to be within the

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.326 A:middle
View that hosts the interaction.

00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:41.646 A:middle
You should specify that view

00:06:41.646 --> 00:06:42.156 A:middle
itself.

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:46.206 A:middle
So, pulling it together; to

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.816 A:middle
expose a single drag from some

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:49.036 A:middle
element doesn't take that much

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:49.496 A:middle
code, at all.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.056 A:middle
You make a Descriptor that

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:52.336 A:middle
specifies that drag by

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:53.826 A:middle
specifying a point in the View

00:06:53.826 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
that hosts the interaction and

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:55.576 A:middle
giving it a name.

00:06:55.576 --> 00:06:57.166 A:middle
And then, you set the

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.056 A:middle
accessibilityDrag

00:06:58.056 --> 00:06:59.736 A:middle
SourceDescriptors property

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
element to an array that
