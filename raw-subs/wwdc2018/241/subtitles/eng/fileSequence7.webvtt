00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
element to an array that

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:01.996 A:middle
includes that descriptor.

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.796 A:middle
Let's go back to our bar graph

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:07.156 A:middle
code that set the Accessibility

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.306 A:middle
elements of the graph view.

00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:10.226 A:middle
What do we need to do to expose

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:11.500 A:middle
dragging each element?

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:15.636 A:middle
We compute a point within the

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:17.636 A:middle
bar represented by that element

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.226 A:middle
in the View's coordinate space,

00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:21.296 A:middle
make an appropriate descriptor

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.556 A:middle
with that point in that View.

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:24.556 A:middle
And set the accessibilityDrag

00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:25.916 A:middle
SourceDescriptors property of

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:26.486 A:middle
the element.

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:27.236 A:middle
And that's it.

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:31.326 A:middle
Now, let's look at a slightly

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:31.996 A:middle
different example.

00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:34.086 A:middle
Let's try to expose multiple

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.576 A:middle
drops from a single element.

00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:37.766 A:middle
This might be useful for a

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:39.656 A:middle
situation like a contact card,

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.746 A:middle
where the card is small enough

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.736 A:middle
that we're going to expose it as

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:47.406 A:middle
one element to Accessibility.

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:49.796 A:middle
But there are multiple wells

00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:52.486 A:middle
into which we can drop content

00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:54.466 A:middle
into the card.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:55.746 A:middle
So, for instance, it might have

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:58.126 A:middle
a portrait and a space for you

00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:59.986 A:middle
to drop arbitrary attachments

00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:00.736 A:middle
for that contact.
