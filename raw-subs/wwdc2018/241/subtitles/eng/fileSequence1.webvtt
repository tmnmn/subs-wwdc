00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.536 A:middle
application to transfer data

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.366 A:middle
both within the application and

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.396 A:middle
between applications.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.836 A:middle
Drag and Drop introduced the

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:07.936 A:middle
concept of interactions, which

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
are hosted by views in your

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:09.926 A:middle
application.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.306 A:middle
To start a drag from a view, you

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.506 A:middle
add a UIDrag interaction object

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:15.686 A:middle
to it.

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:17.566 A:middle
To accept a drop, you add a

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.756 A:middle
UIDrop interaction.

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:20.556 A:middle
If you're not familiar with

00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:22.036 A:middle
these classes you should watch

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:23.416 A:middle
the Introducing Drag and Drop

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.276 A:middle
session from WWDC2017 for more

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:27.726 A:middle
information, and then come back

00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:28.326 A:middle
to this video.

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:32.016 A:middle
Now, let's start to talk about

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:32.736 A:middle
accessibility.

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:34.526 A:middle
Of course, you want to expose

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.006 A:middle
the power of your Drag and Drop

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:37.706 A:middle
interactions to people using

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:38.806 A:middle
your app through an assistive

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.146 A:middle
technology like Voiceover.

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:43.146 A:middle
There are a few accessibility

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
problems the accessibility Drag

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:45.996 A:middle
and Drop API's were designed to

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:46.356 A:middle
solve.

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:48.696 A:middle
First, your accessibility

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:50.046 A:middle
element might not host

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:51.226 A:middle
interactions directly.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:53.036 A:middle
For instance, your accessibility

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.546 A:middle
element might be a view whose

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.816 A:middle
subviews host interactions.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.316 A:middle
Or your element might descend

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.356 A:middle
from a view that hosts
