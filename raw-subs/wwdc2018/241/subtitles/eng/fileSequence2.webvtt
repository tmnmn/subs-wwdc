00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.356 A:middle
from a view that hosts

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:01.776 A:middle
interactions that are logically

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.876 A:middle
associated with it.

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:04.756 A:middle
The solution is that the

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.276 A:middle
Accessibility Drag and Drop

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.086 A:middle
API's allow you to specify

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.925 A:middle
logical drags and drops to the

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:11.966 A:middle
system in a way that makes them

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:12.976 A:middle
usable with assistive

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:13.756 A:middle
technologies.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.846 A:middle
Let's get into those API's now.

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:19.006 A:middle
The UIAccessibilityDragging

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:20.256 A:middle
informal protocol defines two

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.306 A:middle
properties that you use to

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:22.526 A:middle
express drags and drops to

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:23.216 A:middle
Accessibility.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:25.606 A:middle
It deals with the concept of

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.486 A:middle
Drag Sources and Drop Points.

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.306 A:middle
Drag Sources describe where to

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:31.826 A:middle
start drags that are associated

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:33.746 A:middle
with an element and Drop Points

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:35.496 A:middle
describe places associated with

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:36.786 A:middle
an element where items can be

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:37.306 A:middle
dropped.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:39.076 A:middle
To use these properties, you can

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.616 A:middle
assign to them or override the

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:41.686 A:middle
getter to provide data on

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:42.176 A:middle
demand.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.306 A:middle
These drags and drops are

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:46.756 A:middle
exposed to users of assistive

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:48.246 A:middle
technologies in much the same

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:49.836 A:middle
way as Accessibility custom

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.406 A:middle
actions are.

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:55.756 A:middle
So, that's the API, there.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:57.376 A:middle
Often, drags and drops are

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.706 A:middle
exposed automatically to

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.176 A:middle
Accessibility by the system.
