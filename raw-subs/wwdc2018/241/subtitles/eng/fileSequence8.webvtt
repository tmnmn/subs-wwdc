00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:00.736 A:middle
for that contact.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:03.966 A:middle
Now, that we know how to use the

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.686 A:middle
UIAccessibilityDragging informal

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.056 A:middle
protocol, exposing these is

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:07.736 A:middle
straightforward.

00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:11.126 A:middle
We can override the

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:12.096 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:13.676 A:middle
PointDescriptors getter of the

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:17.346 A:middle
View, compute the midpoints of

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.626 A:middle
the two wells, and then return

00:08:19.626 --> 00:08:20.966 A:middle
two location descriptors that

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.256 A:middle
name each drop point.

00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:26.276 A:middle
So, in summary, because you want

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:27.656 A:middle
everyone to be able to use all

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:29.206 A:middle
the cool features you build into

00:08:29.206 --> 00:08:31.136 A:middle
your app, you want to make sure

00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:33.926 A:middle
that the drags and drops

00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:35.316 A:middle
associated with Accessibility

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.876 A:middle
elements in your app are exposed

00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:38.106 A:middle
to assistive technologies.

00:08:38.916 --> 00:08:40.015 A:middle
To do so, use the

00:08:40.015 --> 00:08:41.096 A:middle
accessibilityDrag

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:42.535 A:middle
SourceDescriptors property to

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:43.916 A:middle
specify what drag should be

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:45.546 A:middle
exposed, and the

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:46.496 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:08:46.496 --> 00:08:48.256 A:middle
PointDescriptors property to

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:49.346 A:middle
specify what drop should be

00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:49.876 A:middle
exposed.

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:51.746 A:middle
Finally, these properties are

00:08:51.746 --> 00:08:53.506 A:middle
just arrays of UIAccessibility

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:54.906 A:middle
LocationDescriptor objects,

00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.836 A:middle
which describe to Accessibility

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:58.796 A:middle
where these drags and drops are

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
in your application and how to
