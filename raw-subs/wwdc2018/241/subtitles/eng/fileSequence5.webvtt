00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:01.096 A:middle
structure of my app's content to

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:02.436 A:middle
the Accessibility Runtime.

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:03.916 A:middle
That enables assistive

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:05.356 A:middle
technologies to expose the

00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
content in a different way.

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:08.976 A:middle
We'll need to do the same thing

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:10.276 A:middle
to make the drags accessible,

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.126 A:middle
and to do so we'll need to learn

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:13.466 A:middle
some more specifics about the

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:15.526 A:middle
UIAccessibilityDragging informal

00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:15.966 A:middle
protocol.

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.266 A:middle
First, let's learn about the

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:20.456 A:middle
class UIAccessibility

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:21.426 A:middle
LocationDescriptor.

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:24.806 A:middle
This class is data that

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:26.516 A:middle
describes where an interaction

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:30.686 A:middle
is by specifying a point in a

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:33.896 A:middle
view with a particular name.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:37.086 A:middle
So, for an example in our bar

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.776 A:middle
graph, a location descriptor for

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:42.736 A:middle
dragging that bar there, might

00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:43.486 A:middle
look like this.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.516 A:middle
Its name might be Drag Bar Data.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.766 A:middle
The view would be the bar graph

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:48.516 A:middle
view itself.

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:49.796 A:middle
And the point would be a point

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:50.976 A:middle
that's located within the bar.

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:54.896 A:middle
So, what do we do with

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:55.666 A:middle
UIAccessibility

00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:56.906 A:middle
LocationDescriptor options?

00:05:58.056 --> 00:05:59.326 A:middle
Well, we assign them to the two

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
properties mentioned earlier.
