00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.176 A:middle
Accessibility by the system.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:03.006 A:middle
And if they're found

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.436 A:middle
automatically they're assigned a

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.096 A:middle
default name but note that only

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:08.566 A:middle
interactions in an element

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:10.016 A:middle
subtree are automatically

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:10.696 A:middle
exposed.

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:13.356 A:middle
The UIAccessibilityDragging

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:15.196 A:middle
protocol allows you to expose

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.596 A:middle
exactly the interactions that

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.426 A:middle
make sense, wherever they may

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:19.446 A:middle
actually live in your View

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:20.006 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:22.406 A:middle
Allows you to specify a great

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:23.506 A:middle
name for each one.

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.346 A:middle
So, you should really consider

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:27.646 A:middle
implementing it to provide the

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:29.166 A:middle
best experience for someone

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.436 A:middle
using your application through

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:31.446 A:middle
an assistive technology.

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.216 A:middle
Now, let's look at an example of

00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:36.676 A:middle
how you can expose drags with

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:38.046 A:middle
the UIAccessibilityDragging

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.586 A:middle
informal protocol.

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:42.576 A:middle
Let's say we're building a bar

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.326 A:middle
graph and we've chosen to draw

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.806 A:middle
the bars by configuring CALayer

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:47.366 A:middle
objects.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:49.376 A:middle
And we're going to try and

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:51.836 A:middle
enable dragging of the bars

00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:53.226 A:middle
themselves, to drag the bar

00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
data.

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.896 A:middle
So, here is an example of how

00:03:56.896 --> 00:03:57.536 A:middle
that might look.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.216 A:middle
And again, each of these bars is

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.966 A:middle
going to be a CALayer object.
