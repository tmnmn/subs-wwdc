00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.966 A:middle
going to be a CALayer object.

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:03.286 A:middle
How would we go about

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.336 A:middle
implementing drag for this?

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:08.366 A:middle
It might look something like

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:09.000 A:middle
this.

00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:11.886 A:middle
Note that because layers aren't

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.356 A:middle
views they can't host

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:14.176 A:middle
interactions.

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.106 A:middle
So, the bar graph itself has the

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:17.176 A:middle
interaction installed.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.286 A:middle
And in this itemsForBeginning

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:22.636 A:middle
session callback, depending on

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.926 A:middle
the bar that is hit tested, we

00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:27.376 A:middle
return different data in the

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:28.086 A:middle
drag item.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:30.266 A:middle
Note that even though I only

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:32.086 A:middle
have one drag interaction I am

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.716 A:middle
using it to support multiple

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:34.816 A:middle
logical drags.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.376 A:middle
This is a totally supported

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.836 A:middle
approach and it is an example of

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:39.466 A:middle
how powerful, in general, the

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.116 A:middle
base Drag and Drop API's are.

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:44.356 A:middle
Now, how do you make this

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:44.946 A:middle
accessible?

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:46.986 A:middle
A good approach to making a

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.596 A:middle
graph like this accessible is to

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:51.836 A:middle
expose each bar as an

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:54.076 A:middle
Accessibility element, which

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:54.616 A:middle
I've done here.

00:04:55.676 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
Note that what I'm doing here is

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:58.946 A:middle
providing data about the logical

00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:01.096 A:middle
structure of my app's content to
