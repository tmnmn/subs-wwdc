00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Conor Hughes from the

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.216 A:middle
iOS Accessibility team and I'm

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:22.356 A:middle
here to talk about making your

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.986 A:middle
drags and drops in iOS

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:24.496 A:middle
accessible.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.176 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.576 A:middle
Let's briefly go over what we're

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:30.646 A:middle
going to cover.

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:32.286 A:middle
We'll start with a very brief

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:34.246 A:middle
refresher of the basics of Drag

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:35.036 A:middle
and Drop.

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:36.746 A:middle
Then, we'll go into come

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:37.866 A:middle
concepts behind the

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.456 A:middle
Accessibility Drag and Drop API.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.586 A:middle
And then, we'll go into some

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:43.546 A:middle
examples, first, exposing an

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:44.796 A:middle
ancestor's drag from an

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:46.676 A:middle
accessibility element, and then

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:48.356 A:middle
exposing multiple drops from an

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:49.366 A:middle
Accessibility element.

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:52.526 A:middle
To recap Drag and Drop at a high

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:53.896 A:middle
level, Drag and Drop is a

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.866 A:middle
technology introduced with iOS

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.696 A:middle
11 and provides powerful ways

00:00:57.696 --> 00:00:58.656 A:middle
for someone using your

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.536 A:middle
application to transfer data
