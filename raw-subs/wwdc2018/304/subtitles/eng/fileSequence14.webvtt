And then for the iPad 12.9-inch

00:14:00.696 --> 00:14:02.516 A:middle
display size, I have all

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.446 A:middle
landscape assets, so I need to

00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:06.726 A:middle
select at least one of these in

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.356 A:middle
order for my ads to show on

00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:08.906 A:middle
iPad.

00:14:10.176 --> 00:14:11.916 A:middle
I'll go ahead and pick this one

00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:12.276 A:middle
for now.

00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:16.176 A:middle
Once I've chosen assets for each

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:19.626 A:middle
display size, I click save and

00:14:20.336 --> 00:14:22.596 A:middle
see that my creative set has

00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:25.066 A:middle
been added to my ad group and

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:27.066 A:middle
now I'm ready to start my

00:14:28.676 --> 00:14:28.866 A:middle
campaign.

00:14:32.136 --> 00:14:33.966 A:middle
The Active Travel campaign now

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:36.296 A:middle
appears on my campaigns view and

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:37.526 A:middle
that's how you add a Creative

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:39.676 A:middle
Set to a new campaign and ad

00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:40.136 A:middle
group.

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.156 A:middle
Next, let me show you how to add

00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:45.786 A:middle
a Creative Set to an existing

00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.256 A:middle
campaign and ad group.

00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:50.526 A:middle
Let's go into my Navigation

00:14:50.526 --> 00:14:51.126 A:middle
campaign.

00:14:51.656 --> 00:14:55.956 A:middle
And from there, let's go into

00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:59.676 A:middle
the City Maps ad group and I'll

00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:01.676 A:middle
