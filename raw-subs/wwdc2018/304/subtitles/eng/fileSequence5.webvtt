00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.856 A:middle
add another app that I want to

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:03.976 A:middle
promote and I can also make

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.776 A:middle
changes to any of my existing

00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:06.596 A:middle
app promotions.

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.236 A:middle
So, I am currently running

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:10.636 A:middle
promotions in the U.S. App Store

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:11.886 A:middle
for my LightRight app and I'd

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:13.786 A:middle
like to expand that to more app

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:14.176 A:middle
stores.

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.446 A:middle
To do that, I simply click on

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:18.406 A:middle
the edit button at the top of

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:21.536 A:middle
the apps card and my LightRight

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:23.946 A:middle
app is only available in 10 of

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:25.736 A:middle
the app stores where Search Ads

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.046 A:middle
is offered, so I'm only

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:28.706 A:middle
presented with those 10 options.

00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:31.246 A:middle
Now, I can pick markets

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.176 A:middle
individually, Canada and France,

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.996 A:middle
for example, or I can select

00:05:35.996 --> 00:05:36.196 A:middle
all.

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:42.696 A:middle
I save. And I can now see that

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:44.976 A:middle
my app is being promoted in 10

00:05:44.976 --> 00:05:50.246 A:middle
of 10 available app stores.

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:51.926 A:middle
Now, because I'm promoting my

00:05:51.926 --> 00:05:53.546 A:middle
app across more app stores, I

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:54.956 A:middle
also want to increase my monthly

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:56.926 A:middle
budget to enable me to reach

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:58.166 A:middle
more users and achieve more

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.816 A:middle
installs, so I'm going to change

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:03.016 A:middle
my monthly budget from $1000 to
