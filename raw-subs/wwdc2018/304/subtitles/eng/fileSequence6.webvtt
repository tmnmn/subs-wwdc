00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:03.016 A:middle
my monthly budget from $1000 to

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:07.176 A:middle
$3500.

00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:10.126 A:middle
My change is saved and I'm done.

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:12.886 A:middle
It's really that simple and we

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:14.356 A:middle
can't wait for more of you to

00:06:14.356 --> 00:06:14.826 A:middle
try it.

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:18.156 A:middle
And that was Search Ads Basic.

00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:21.236 A:middle
So, let's talk about Advanced

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:23.506 A:middle
and, more specifically, new

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:24.536 A:middle
creative options.

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:29.326 A:middle
Developers have told us they

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:31.116 A:middle
love the ease of Search Ads

00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:32.236 A:middle
Creative and how we

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:34.016 A:middle
automatically create the ads

00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:36.236 A:middle
using the metadata and imagery

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:37.876 A:middle
you already provide for your App

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:38.836 A:middle
Store product page.

00:06:39.116 --> 00:06:41.556 A:middle
And App Store customers respond

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:43.436 A:middle
really well to those ads because

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.206 A:middle
of their noninvasive appearance

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:46.946 A:middle
and because they're an accurate

00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:48.246 A:middle
representation of what they can

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:49.306 A:middle
expect from the app's

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:49.966 A:middle
experience.

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:54.456 A:middle
Since February, you've had the

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.606 A:middle
option to add up to 10 app
