00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:01.786 A:middle
Since I want my ads to show to

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.246 A:middle
all users, I'll leave the

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.906 A:middle
audience settings alone for now

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:04.973 A:middle
too.

00:11:09.476 --> 00:11:11.446 A:middle
Here I can see a preview of the

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:14.376 A:middle
default text ad and the default

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:16.886 A:middle
image ad, which shows alongside

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:18.766 A:middle
the ads from my Creative Sets

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:21.766 A:middle
and matches the organic search

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:22.086 A:middle
result.

00:11:24.606 --> 00:11:27.826 A:middle
But, since I want to use assets

00:11:27.866 --> 00:11:29.516 A:middle
that are more closely aligned to

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.066 A:middle
my fitness theme, I'm going to

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.506 A:middle
create a Creative Set for that,

00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:34.006 A:middle
so let's go ahead and add one

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:37.036 A:middle
now by clicking Add Creative

00:11:37.886 --> 00:11:37.976 A:middle
Set.

00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:42.166 A:middle
I'll name this Creative Set

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:46.576 A:middle
Social Hiking and choose the

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:47.946 A:middle
localization language.

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:50.556 A:middle
The set of languages depends on

00:11:50.556 --> 00:11:51.456 A:middle
the storefronts that I'm

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:53.426 A:middle
promoting in and on the

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:54.786 A:middle
localized assets that I

00:11:54.786 --> 00:11:56.116 A:middle
submitted to App Store Connect.

00:11:57.346 --> 00:11:58.776 A:middle
I'll leave this as English for

00:11:58.776 --> 00:11:59.026 A:middle
now.
