00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.266 A:middle
choose more than 3 assets,

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:01.756 A:middle
including some that are already

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.996 A:middle
used in the default ads, and let

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:05.996 A:middle
Search Ads automatically create

00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:08.676 A:middle
the various combinations of ads

00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:14.386 A:middle
from all of these assets.

00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:16.586 A:middle
Search Ads uses machine learning

00:16:16.636 --> 00:16:18.796 A:middle
to continuously optimize to show

00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:21.456 A:middle
the best performing ads.

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:24.866 A:middle
Since I'm only interested in

00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:26.946 A:middle
testing ad variations for iPhone

00:16:26.946 --> 00:16:29.196 A:middle
at this time, I'm going to elect

00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.586 A:middle
to use default assets for iPad,

00:16:32.146 --> 00:16:34.186 A:middle
which means only the default ads

00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:35.526 A:middle
will show on iPad.

00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:40.886 A:middle
I click save and now I've added

00:16:40.886 --> 00:16:43.466 A:middle
my first Creative Set to this ad

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:46.496 A:middle
group and I can create up to 10

00:16:46.496 --> 00:16:47.966 A:middle
Creative Sets per ad group.

00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:51.326 A:middle
I can return to this view at any

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:53.086 A:middle
time to check how this Creative

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.996 A:middle
Set is performing versus the

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:55.696 A:middle
default ads.
