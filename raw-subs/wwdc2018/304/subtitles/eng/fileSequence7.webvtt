00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:05.366 A:middle
And just last week, we were

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:07.526 A:middle
excited to introduce our newest

ability to leverage these

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:14.426 A:middle

Now, let me turn it over to

Carol, who's going to tell you

00:07:26.756 --> 00:07:28.586 A:middle

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:45.426 A:middle
As Lindsay just showed, you can

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:46.806 A:middle
use Creative Sets to display

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:47.986 A:middle
different app previews in

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:51.166 A:middle
keyword themes or specific

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:51.826 A:middle
audiences.

00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:54.576 A:middle
Since Creative Sets uses App

00:07:56.606 --> 00:07:58.556 A:middle
ensures the best user

00:07:58.556 --> 00:07:59.166 A:middle
