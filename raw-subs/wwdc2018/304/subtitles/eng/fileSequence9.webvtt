00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:08.556 A:middle
Here I am, already logged into

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:09.816 A:middle
my Search Ads account.

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:12.046 A:middle
And I'm on the campaigns view.

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:14.576 A:middle
Let's go ahead and create a new

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:15.666 A:middle
campaign together.

00:09:17.926 --> 00:09:20.806 A:middle
I'll start by clicking Create

00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:23.356 A:middle
Campaign, choosing my app,

00:09:25.056 --> 00:09:28.406 A:middle
TripTrek, the storefront that I

00:09:28.406 --> 00:09:30.676 A:middle
want to promote it in, and I'll

00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:31.866 A:middle
give it a campaign name.

00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:35.346 A:middle
Let's call this one Active

00:09:35.346 --> 00:09:35.736 A:middle
Travel.

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:45.786 A:middle
I'll assign a budget and for now

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:47.466 A:middle
I'll skip over the daily cap and

00:09:47.466 --> 00:09:48.796 A:middle
the campaign negative keywords.

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:52.816 A:middle
We'll go ahead and create the

00:09:52.816 --> 00:09:54.876 A:middle
first ad group in this campaign.

00:09:55.156 --> 00:09:58.636 A:middle
I'm going to call it fitness to

00:09:58.636 --> 00:10:00.466 A:middle
match the keywords that I plan
