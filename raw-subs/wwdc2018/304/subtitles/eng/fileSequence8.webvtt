00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:01.266 A:middle
I'm here to show you how it's

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:01.566 A:middle
done.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.476 A:middle
Before we begin, imagine I'm a

00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:07.236 A:middle
developer and these are all of

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.526 A:middle
the assets that I've uploaded to

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.466 A:middle
App Store Connect for my app,

00:08:10.986 --> 00:08:11.526 A:middle
TripTrek.

00:08:12.606 --> 00:08:14.216 A:middle
TripTrek is an app that lets

00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:16.676 A:middle
users document every step of

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:17.856 A:middle
their travels and treks.

00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:22.096 A:middle
The first three assets will be

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:23.586 A:middle
used in my default ad.

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:26.436 A:middle
The default ad matches what

00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:28.356 A:middle
shows in organic search results;

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.956 A:middle
however, there are 2 specific

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:32.525 A:middle
keyword themes that I want to

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.385 A:middle
focus on with my Search Ads

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:39.736 A:middle
campaigns, fitness and mapping.

00:08:43.436 --> 00:08:44.726 A:middle
I can use Creative Sets to

00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:46.106 A:middle
choose the assets that best

00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:47.466 A:middle
align to those themes.

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:49.596 A:middle
Let's go through the steps of

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.306 A:middle
how I do that by adding Creative

00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:53.236 A:middle
Sets to my Search Ads campaigns

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:54.186 A:middle
and ad groups now.
