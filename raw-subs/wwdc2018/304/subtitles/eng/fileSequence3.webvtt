users in more of the markets

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:02.416 A:middle
you've told us are most

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.256 A:middle
important to you.

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:06.366 A:middle
And, what's more, we'll be

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.566 A:middle
introducing Search Ads Basic to

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:10.416 A:middle
all 13 App Stores where Search

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:10.966 A:middle
Ads will be available.

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:16.786 A:middle
And we've worked hard to make

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.496 A:middle
sure that Search Ads Basic

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.136 A:middle
remains a simple, easy,

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:22.976 A:middle

promote your apps across

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:25.916 A:middle
multiple app stores.

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:28.536 A:middle
Let me show you how easy it's

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.516 A:middle
going to be.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.426 A:middle
Imagine I'm a developer and I

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:34.966 A:middle
want to start to promote my new

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:35.646 A:middle
app, NoMoss.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:39.916 A:middle
I simply select the app from the

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:43.506 A:middle
drop-down list and note that I

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.516 A:middle
know see an ad example on the

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.336 A:middle
right and I'm also presented

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:49.416 A:middle
with a list of the app stores

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.016 A:middle
where Search Ads is available

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:53.246 A:middle
and also where my NoMoss app is

00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:53.966 A:middle
available too.

00:03:55.206 --> 00:03:56.956 A:middle
I want to permit my app in as

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.776 A:middle
many app stores as I can and so

00:03:58.776 --> 00:03:59.956 A:middle
I'm going to leave all of those

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:00.516 A:middle
selected.
