00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.286 A:middle
Next, I need to choose the right

00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:04.536 A:middle
combination of assets to create

00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:05.896 A:middle
an effective creative set.

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:08.636 A:middle
Here I can see all of the

00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:10.156 A:middle
screenshots and app previews

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.156 A:middle
from the available set of assets

00:12:12.406 --> 00:12:15.136 A:middle
on my app product page organized

00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:20.596 A:middle
by display size and in the order

00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:22.056 A:middle
that I submitted to App Store

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:23.206 A:middle
Connect.

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.716 A:middle
I'll only see the display sizes

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:28.236 A:middle
that have enough localized

00:12:28.236 --> 00:12:30.106 A:middle
assets to satisfy a Creative

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
Set.

00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:32.966 A:middle
In App Store Connect, I had

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:34.936 A:middle
elected to use the 5.5-inch

00:12:34.936 --> 00:12:37.606 A:middle
display, which is why I don't

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:39.366 A:middle
see any other iPhone display

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.956 A:middle
size assets here.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.306 A:middle
If I'm having trouble

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:46.636 A:middle
remembering which devices are

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.456 A:middle
which display size, I can go to

00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:50.276 A:middle
the upper right-hand corner and

00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:52.606 A:middle
click on View Device Display

00:12:52.606 --> 00:12:54.706 A:middle
Sizes to see that information.

00:12:56.156 --> 00:12:57.266 A:middle
I'll go ahead and close this

00:12:58.866 --> 00:12:58.996 A:middle
now.
