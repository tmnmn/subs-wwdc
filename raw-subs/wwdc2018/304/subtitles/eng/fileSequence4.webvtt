00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:00.516 A:middle
selected.

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:05.826 A:middle
Next, I enter my monthly budget,

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:08.336 A:middle
which is a single budget across

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:09.806 A:middle
all of the app stores where my

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:10.796 A:middle
app promotion will run.

00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:13.536 A:middle
My monthly budget for NoMoss is

00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:14.566 A:middle
$5000.

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:19.315 A:middle
And, finally, I input what is

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.055 A:middle
the maximum amount I'm willing

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.326 A:middle
to pay for an install.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.676 A:middle
Now, note Search Ads is

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:25.996 A:middle
recommending a maximum

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:28.336 A:middle
cost-per-install of $1.50, which

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:29.986 A:middle
is based on what it knows about

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.246 A:middle
my app and also what similar

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:33.586 A:middle
apps are willing to pay for an

00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:35.626 A:middle
install, so I'm going to take

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:36.516 A:middle
that recommendation.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:41.616 A:middle
I then save and I'm taken to my

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:43.336 A:middle
dashboard where I'll check back

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:43.976 A:middle
later to see the results.

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:50.906 A:middle
I can now see confirmation that

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:51.986 A:middle
my new app promotion has been

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:53.586 A:middle
saved and it should start

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:54.736 A:middle
running soon.

00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:59.326 A:middle
From my dashboard, I can also

00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.856 A:middle
add another app that I want to
