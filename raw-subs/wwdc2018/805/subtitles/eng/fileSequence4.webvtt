00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.936 A:middle
Because for every AR app, ARKit

00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:03.076 A:middle
needs some level of

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.286 A:middle
understanding of the world in

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.876 A:middle
order to start the AR

00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:07.506 A:middle
experience.

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:08.486 A:middle
In order to get it going.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:11.486 A:middle
Because every AR app needs to --

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.376 A:middle
needs that understanding in

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.666 A:middle
order to place its objects into

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.446 A:middle
the world, or show the user that

00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:17.196 A:middle
information.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:20.266 A:middle
And, the way ARKit builds that

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:22.065 A:middle
understanding of the world, is

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:23.116 A:middle
by getting you to move your

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:24.816 A:middle
device, by having you move

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:25.186 A:middle
around.

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:27.076 A:middle
And, that's a little bit

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.346 A:middle
different from other places that

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:30.846 A:middle
you might have looked through a

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:32.456 A:middle
device, seen a camera preview,

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:33.596 A:middle
in the past.

00:04:34.386 --> 00:04:35.386 A:middle
Like, for example, when you're

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:37.096 A:middle
taking a photo, you just need to

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:38.836 A:middle
point the device where you want

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:39.636 A:middle
to frame the shot.

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:42.066 A:middle
But, in AR, you really do need

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:43.576 A:middle
to start moving, looking at the

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:44.916 A:middle
same place from different

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.466 A:middle
positions, and looking at it

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:47.446 A:middle
from some different angles.

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:51.056 A:middle
So, the trick here is to let

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:52.746 A:middle
people know what they need to

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:52.916 A:middle
do.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:54.476 A:middle
Let them know how to move, that

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:55.426 A:middle
they need to move their device.

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.416 A:middle
And, the way to do that is to

00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:58.826 A:middle
give them a fixed reference.

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.266 A:middle
Give them something to base that
