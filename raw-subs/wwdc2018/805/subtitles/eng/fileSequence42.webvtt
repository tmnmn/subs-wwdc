00:42:00.076 --> 00:42:02.276 A:middle
My bad. Let's jump back to

00:42:02.276 --> 00:42:03.876 A:middle
actually building out this

00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:04.626 A:middle
campfire mesh.

00:42:05.246 --> 00:42:07.136 A:middle
I want to give a quick high/low

00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:08.796 A:middle
review of what a mesh is, and

00:42:08.796 --> 00:42:10.216 A:middle
the basic data structures that

00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:10.786 A:middle
comprise it.

00:42:11.536 --> 00:42:12.596 A:middle
So, now you can think of a mesh

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.226 A:middle
as being a collection of

00:42:14.516 --> 00:42:15.886 A:middle
triangles that are arranged in

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:17.536 A:middle
3D space that will form a

00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:19.156 A:middle
surface for you to apply

00:42:19.426 --> 00:42:20.116 A:middle
materials on.

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:22.486 A:middle
And, the corners of these

00:42:22.486 --> 00:42:24.306 A:middle
triangles are actually made up

00:42:24.306 --> 00:42:25.686 A:middle
of points called vertices, which

00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:26.846 A:middle
hold different pieces of

00:42:26.846 --> 00:42:28.736 A:middle
information, such as its

00:42:28.736 --> 00:42:30.106 A:middle
position in space, UV

00:42:30.106 --> 00:42:31.506 A:middle
coordinates for texture

00:42:31.506 --> 00:42:33.116 A:middle
application, as well as a very

00:42:33.116 --> 00:42:34.166 A:middle
important property that we'll go

00:42:34.166 --> 00:42:35.956 A:middle
over later called the normals.

00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:38.836 A:middle
Well, since I got busted for

00:42:38.836 --> 00:42:40.356 A:middle
trying to ship early, I wanted

00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:41.726 A:middle
to redeem myself by building out

00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.356 A:middle
one of the most gorgeous

00:42:43.636 --> 00:42:45.016 A:middle
campfires in the world.

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:46.706 A:middle
Take a look at the details of

00:42:46.706 --> 00:42:47.216 A:middle
this camp.

00:42:47.536 --> 00:42:48.616 A:middle
Look at that fish and those

00:42:48.706 --> 00:42:49.096 A:middle
branches.

00:42:49.856 --> 00:42:51.126 A:middle
You can see all the intricate

00:42:51.126 --> 00:42:52.996 A:middle
details of the scales, as well

00:42:52.996 --> 00:42:53.976 A:middle
as the etchings found on the

00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:54.266 A:middle
bark.

00:42:55.296 --> 00:42:57.266 A:middle
But, man, my performance has

00:42:57.266 --> 00:42:57.546 A:middle
tanked.

00:42:58.116 --> 00:42:59.716 A:middle
And, that poly count has gone up

00:42:59.716 --> 00:43:01.016 A:middle
to almost about a million
