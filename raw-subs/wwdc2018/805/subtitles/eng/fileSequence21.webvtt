00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:00.256 A:middle
just put your finger down and

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:01.516 A:middle
drag them to a new place.

00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:02.756 A:middle
And, it feels like you're

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:04.526 A:middle
picking up the object, because

00:21:04.526 --> 00:21:05.716 A:middle
it stays under your finger.

00:21:05.716 --> 00:21:07.346 A:middle
You get this physical connection

00:21:07.346 --> 00:21:08.796 A:middle
to the thing that you're moving.

00:21:11.216 --> 00:21:13.606 A:middle
Another gesture you can do, is

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:14.796 A:middle
scaling objects.

00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:17.226 A:middle
So, in AR, things start out at

00:21:17.226 --> 00:21:18.466 A:middle
their physical size, at their

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:19.506 A:middle
natural size.

00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:21.146 A:middle
But, if you want to change that,

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:22.736 A:middle
you can pinch the object to make

00:21:22.736 --> 00:21:23.216 A:middle
it bigger.

00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:24.766 A:middle
And, you can pinch out on the

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:25.836 A:middle
object if you want to make it

00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:26.376 A:middle
smaller.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.246 A:middle
The important things to think

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:29.206 A:middle
about when you're scaling

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:31.176 A:middle
objects in AR, is to give some

00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:32.436 A:middle
feedback when you're doing it.

00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:34.016 A:middle
Because the change is really,

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:35.406 A:middle
really big when you take an

00:21:35.406 --> 00:21:36.796 A:middle
object and scale it up to 4

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.666 A:middle
times the size.

00:21:38.496 --> 00:21:40.036 A:middle
So, it's important to give

00:21:40.036 --> 00:21:41.466 A:middle
people feedback, so they

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.726 A:middle
absolutely know what happened.

00:21:43.626 --> 00:21:44.996 A:middle
And, the second thing is to make

00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:47.056 A:middle
it really easy to go -- to take

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:48.636 A:middle
the object back to its natural

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:49.146 A:middle
size.

00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:50.536 A:middle
Back to the size that it would

00:21:50.536 --> 00:21:51.846 A:middle
be in the physical world.

00:21:52.236 --> 00:21:54.496 A:middle
So, you can snap back to 100%,

00:21:54.886 --> 00:21:56.186 A:middle
maybe with a haptic, to make

00:21:56.186 --> 00:21:56.966 A:middle
that really easy.

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.316 A:middle
Another thing you can do is
