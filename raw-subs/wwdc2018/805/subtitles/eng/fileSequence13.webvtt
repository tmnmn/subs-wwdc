00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.706 A:middle
So, the simplest way to show

00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:03.826 A:middle
text in AR, is to put it out

00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:04.966 A:middle
into the world, to put it in

00:13:04.966 --> 00:13:05.616 A:middle
perspective.

00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:07.546 A:middle
And, you know, that can look

00:13:07.546 --> 00:13:08.286 A:middle
really cool.

00:13:08.926 --> 00:13:10.656 A:middle
But, it also has some drawbacks.

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:12.916 A:middle
And, one of those drawbacks is

00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:14.096 A:middle
what happens when you look at it

00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:15.286 A:middle
from an angle.

00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:17.066 A:middle
The letters can, sort of, squish

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:17.656 A:middle
together.

00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:18.896 A:middle
It can be a little hard to read.

00:13:19.996 --> 00:13:21.576 A:middle
And, another issue is what

00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:23.126 A:middle
happens when you take a step

00:13:23.126 --> 00:13:24.096 A:middle
back, when you're looking from

00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:24.866 A:middle
further away.

00:13:25.386 --> 00:13:26.826 A:middle
The text can get really small.

00:13:26.826 --> 00:13:27.726 A:middle
It's like trying to read a piece

00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:29.616 A:middle
of paper from all the way across

00:13:29.646 --> 00:13:30.116 A:middle
the room.

00:13:30.746 --> 00:13:32.636 A:middle
So, if you're showing titles, or

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:34.126 A:middle
other kinds of things that maybe

00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:35.246 A:middle
people already know, or could

00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:36.886 A:middle
get in another way, it can be

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:37.946 A:middle
really cool to show that in

00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:38.596 A:middle
perspective.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:40.306 A:middle
But, if you're showing something

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:41.636 A:middle
that people really need to read,

00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:43.736 A:middle
need to get information from,

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:44.966 A:middle
you might want to try a

00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:45.706 A:middle
different option.

00:13:45.846 --> 00:13:48.986 A:middle
So, a different option that you

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:51.036 A:middle
can use, is to show your text in

00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:51.866 A:middle
screen space.

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:53.966 A:middle
And, what I mean by screen

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:55.496 A:middle
space, is that the text is

00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:57.116 A:middle
always the same size.

00:13:57.576 --> 00:13:58.956 A:middle
It's always facing you.

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:00.086 A:middle
It's always head-on.
