00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.036 A:middle
associated with this mesh.

00:51:02.396 --> 00:51:03.966 A:middle
Whew. Alright, so we've gone

00:51:03.966 --> 00:51:05.356 A:middle
through enough about normals.

00:51:05.356 --> 00:51:06.776 A:middle
Let's, kind of, go over what it

00:51:06.776 --> 00:51:07.846 A:middle
takes to add a little bit more

00:51:07.846 --> 00:51:09.426 A:middle
shiny to your scene.

00:51:10.216 --> 00:51:12.066 A:middle
CampfiAR is definitely starting

00:51:12.066 --> 00:51:12.526 A:middle
to look better.

00:51:13.076 --> 00:51:14.756 A:middle
But, some of these normal maps

00:51:14.756 --> 00:51:15.706 A:middle
[inaudible] but some of these

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:16.886 A:middle
parts seem a bit dull,

00:51:17.406 --> 00:51:18.416 A:middle
especially the objects that you

00:51:18.416 --> 00:51:19.786 A:middle
expect to be shiny or

00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:20.806 A:middle
reflective, kind of like the

00:51:20.806 --> 00:51:21.916 A:middle
kettle or the fish in this

00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:22.136 A:middle
scene.

00:51:23.286 --> 00:51:24.576 A:middle
What we see here is the results

00:51:24.576 --> 00:51:26.356 A:middle
of applying a metal map to our

00:51:26.426 --> 00:51:26.886 A:middle
AR scene.

00:51:27.496 --> 00:51:29.766 A:middle
A metal map is used to determine

00:51:29.766 --> 00:51:31.146 A:middle
which object surfaces should

00:51:31.146 --> 00:51:33.016 A:middle
exhibit reflective properties.

00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:34.966 A:middle
Once the material property's

00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:36.756 A:middle
activated, notice how shiny and

00:51:36.756 --> 00:51:38.326 A:middle
reflective the area's we've

00:51:38.326 --> 00:51:39.306 A:middle
designated as being metallic

00:51:39.306 --> 00:51:39.626 A:middle
are.

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.256 A:middle
And, on the kettle as well as

00:51:41.406 --> 00:51:42.476 A:middle
the scales of the fish.

00:51:42.476 --> 00:51:45.956 A:middle
So, let's focus specifically on

00:51:45.956 --> 00:51:46.276 A:middle
the kettle.

00:51:47.166 --> 00:51:48.056 A:middle
We'll begin by taking the

00:51:48.086 --> 00:51:49.796 A:middle
original albedo map, and then

00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:51.166 A:middle
apply a metal map to the

00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:52.446 A:middle
metalness property of this

00:51:52.446 --> 00:51:52.836 A:middle
material.

00:51:53.756 --> 00:51:55.106 A:middle
After the application of the

00:51:55.106 --> 00:51:56.706 A:middle
metal map, the 3D render will

00:51:56.706 --> 00:51:58.006 A:middle
actually designate the surface

00:51:58.006 --> 00:52:00.466 A:middle
to be reflective in the areas on
