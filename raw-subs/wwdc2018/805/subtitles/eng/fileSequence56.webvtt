00:55:58.726 --> 00:56:00.686 A:middle
normal maped logs before.

00:56:00.836 --> 00:56:02.436 A:middle
Now, there's some great details

00:56:02.436 --> 00:56:03.756 A:middle
found in the ridges, but we can

00:56:03.756 --> 00:56:04.746 A:middle
definitely improve some of these

00:56:04.746 --> 00:56:05.256 A:middle
areas.

00:56:06.366 --> 00:56:07.436 A:middle
Now, as we look at the ambient

00:56:07.436 --> 00:56:08.626 A:middle
occlusion map, you can see how

00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:10.366 A:middle
we've added some regions of

00:56:10.696 --> 00:56:11.386 A:middle
self-shadowing.

00:56:11.386 --> 00:56:12.956 A:middle
So, lower portions of the log,

00:56:12.956 --> 00:56:14.176 A:middle
as well as around the small

00:56:14.176 --> 00:56:15.026 A:middle
embedded stumps.

00:56:15.346 --> 00:56:17.746 A:middle
And, after we apply the map to

00:56:17.746 --> 00:56:19.196 A:middle
our ambient occlusion property,

00:56:19.446 --> 00:56:20.746 A:middle
I hope you can see the benefits

00:56:20.746 --> 00:56:22.286 A:middle
of adding those baked detail

00:56:22.286 --> 00:56:24.036 A:middle
shadows without the need of

00:56:24.036 --> 00:56:25.516 A:middle
using expensive dynamic lights

00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:26.066 A:middle
in your scene.

00:56:26.586 --> 00:56:30.266 A:middle
When working in AR, we recommend

00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:31.426 A:middle
that you actually bake your

00:56:31.426 --> 00:56:32.766 A:middle
ambient occlusion into a map.

00:56:33.316 --> 00:56:34.086 A:middle
Which is what we've done for

00:56:34.086 --> 00:56:34.456 A:middle
CampfiAR.

00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:36.426 A:middle
Rather than use the alternative,

00:56:37.086 --> 00:56:39.056 A:middle
such as screen space ambient

00:56:39.326 --> 00:56:40.306 A:middle
occlusions, which is a

00:56:40.306 --> 00:56:41.886 A:middle
camera-based post-process

00:56:41.886 --> 00:56:43.286 A:middle
effect, and can potentially lead

00:56:43.286 --> 00:56:45.256 A:middle
to poor rendering performance in

00:56:45.706 --> 00:56:47.076 A:middle
your scene.

00:56:47.176 --> 00:56:48.336 A:middle
And, last but certainly not

00:56:48.336 --> 00:56:50.686 A:middle
least, be frugal with the use of

00:56:50.686 --> 00:56:51.526 A:middle
your transparency in your

00:56:51.526 --> 00:56:52.346 A:middle
materials materials.

00:56:52.346 --> 00:56:53.926 A:middle
If you must use transparencies,

00:56:54.126 --> 00:56:54.956 A:middle
we recommend that you use

00:56:54.956 --> 00:56:56.336 A:middle
separate materials for objects

00:56:56.336 --> 00:56:57.506 A:middle
where you see a combination of

00:56:57.716 --> 00:56:59.066 A:middle
transparent and non-transparent

00:56:59.066 --> 00:56:59.696 A:middle
surfaces.
