00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:02.126 A:middle
tricks for all kinds of AR apps

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:02.886 A:middle
and AR games.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.356 A:middle
And, I want to start with some

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.196 A:middle
of the more radical

00:09:06.196 --> 00:09:08.076 A:middle
possibilities of things you can

00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:08.906 A:middle
build in ARKit.

00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:11.266 A:middle
Because not every AR experience

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:13.006 A:middle
has to look like looking through

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:14.306 A:middle
your device, seeing a camera

00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:15.886 A:middle
preview of the world, and then

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:17.566 A:middle
placing objects out into space.

00:09:17.946 --> 00:09:19.296 A:middle
There are other options as well.

00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:23.306 A:middle
So, one of those options is to

00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:25.836 A:middle
build an AR experience entirely

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:26.886 A:middle
in two dimensions.

00:09:27.456 --> 00:09:28.566 A:middle
You don't need to show a camera

00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
preview.

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:30.696 A:middle
You don't need any kind of 3D

00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:31.376 A:middle
graphics.

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.276 A:middle
You're using that information

00:09:33.516 --> 00:09:35.186 A:middle
that ARKit gets about the world

00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.546 A:middle
to present a great AR

00:09:38.546 --> 00:09:40.646 A:middle
experiences entirely in 2D.

00:09:41.986 --> 00:09:42.676 A:middle
So, let's take a look at an

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:43.726 A:middle
example of that.

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:46.166 A:middle
This is the game "Rainbrow."

00:09:47.026 --> 00:09:49.266 A:middle
And, in Rainbrow, the way you

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:50.396 A:middle
control you character is by

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:51.756 A:middle
moving your eyebrows up and

00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:51.956 A:middle
down.
