00:57:59.256 --> 00:58:01.286 A:middle
video, and uses them to estimate

00:58:01.286 --> 00:58:02.306 A:middle
the lighting condition of the

00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:02.936 A:middle
real world.

00:58:02.936 --> 00:58:05.076 A:middle
It is an absolutely magical

00:58:05.076 --> 00:58:06.756 A:middle
feature that helps assure that

00:58:06.756 --> 00:58:08.136 A:middle
the amount to light applied to

00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:09.776 A:middle
your AR content matches what you

00:58:09.776 --> 00:58:10.546 A:middle
see in the real world.

00:58:10.546 --> 00:58:13.536 A:middle
Now, that we have magical light

00:58:13.536 --> 00:58:15.026 A:middle
wizards living in our AR scene,

00:58:15.096 --> 00:58:16.086 A:middle
let's discuss shadows.

00:58:16.796 --> 00:58:18.756 A:middle
Shadows in AR are really, really

00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:19.416 A:middle
hard to get right.

00:58:20.246 --> 00:58:21.176 A:middle
Your shadow needs to be able to

00:58:21.176 --> 00:58:22.506 A:middle
work in a wide variety of

00:58:22.506 --> 00:58:23.206 A:middle
situations.

00:58:23.386 --> 00:58:25.096 A:middle
Remember that people can be

00:58:25.096 --> 00:58:26.206 A:middle
potentially using your app

00:58:26.356 --> 00:58:26.776 A:middle
anywhere.

00:58:27.046 --> 00:58:28.516 A:middle
And, if your AR shadows differ

00:58:28.916 --> 00:58:29.766 A:middle
from the ones that are seen in

00:58:29.766 --> 00:58:30.796 A:middle
the real world environment, it

00:58:30.796 --> 00:58:31.976 A:middle
can be relatively jarring for

00:58:31.976 --> 00:58:32.676 A:middle
your experience.

00:58:34.016 --> 00:58:35.136 A:middle
Here, we have tried to

00:58:35.226 --> 00:58:36.936 A:middle
incorrectly cast a dynamic

00:58:36.936 --> 00:58:39.396 A:middle
shadow by using a directional

00:58:39.396 --> 00:58:40.996 A:middle
light as a sharp angle in our 3D

00:58:40.996 --> 00:58:41.286 A:middle
engine.

00:58:42.226 --> 00:58:43.686 A:middle
Shadows are a great way to make

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:44.866 A:middle
objects actually feel grounded

00:58:44.866 --> 00:58:45.716 A:middle
in the real world, but in this

00:58:45.716 --> 00:58:47.066 A:middle
case, it doesn't really match

00:58:47.066 --> 00:58:48.256 A:middle
the shadows being seen in the

00:58:48.256 --> 00:58:49.156 A:middle
surrounding environment.

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:50.716 A:middle
It's like we're purposely trying

00:58:50.716 --> 00:58:52.046 A:middle
to defy the laws of physics

00:58:53.816 --> 00:58:53.926 A:middle
here.

00:58:54.136 --> 00:58:55.316 A:middle
Instead, we suggest that you

00:58:55.316 --> 00:58:56.326 A:middle
place your directional light

00:58:56.326 --> 00:58:58.076 A:middle
directly overhead, and play a

00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:58.846 A:middle
little bit around with the

00:58:58.846 --> 00:59:00.526 A:middle
intensity of that effect to make
