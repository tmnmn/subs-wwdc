00:40:00.426 --> 00:40:01.876 A:middle
So, I'm not really an outdoorsy

00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:03.876 A:middle
guy, but coming to California, I

00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.336 A:middle
find that here a lot of people

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:05.506 A:middle
are.

00:40:05.506 --> 00:40:07.086 A:middle
So, I've been trying to connect

00:40:07.086 --> 00:40:07.646 A:middle
with nature.

00:40:08.146 --> 00:40:09.776 A:middle
You know, go camping, maybe make

00:40:09.776 --> 00:40:12.036 A:middle
a campfire for once, and yet it

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:13.196 A:middle
really didn't happen.

00:40:13.196 --> 00:40:14.156 A:middle
So, instead I thought, let's

00:40:14.156 --> 00:40:15.196 A:middle
just throw it into an app, and

00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:15.806 A:middle
see how it goes.

00:40:16.436 --> 00:40:18.386 A:middle
And we're going to call it

00:40:18.386 --> 00:40:19.016 A:middle
CampfiAR.

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:22.086 A:middle
I know, it's perfect, right?

00:40:23.696 --> 00:40:24.956 A:middle
Now, we can work on building out

00:40:25.046 --> 00:40:26.816 A:middle
a detailed, single object, and

00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:28.126 A:middle
bring all the joys of being

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:29.456 A:middle
outdoors without the fear of any

00:40:29.456 --> 00:40:31.376 A:middle
of those bugs or fresh air.

00:40:34.096 --> 00:40:35.616 A:middle
We decided to render with a

00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:37.396 A:middle
stylized, semi-realistic, and

00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:38.506 A:middle
playful graphical style.

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.126 A:middle
And, apply unique details to the

00:40:41.126 --> 00:40:42.726 A:middle
use of careful application of

00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:44.336 A:middle
some key, physically-based

00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:45.346 A:middle
material properties.

00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:47.796 A:middle
These choices mean that we could

00:40:47.796 --> 00:40:48.946 A:middle
potentially use a lot of

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.426 A:middle
polygons to render the content

00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:52.526 A:middle
on the screen, but why deprive

00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:53.986 A:middle
people of the ability to spend

00:40:53.986 --> 00:40:55.296 A:middle
multiple hours staring at our

00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:56.226 A:middle
beautiful campfire?

00:40:56.876 --> 00:40:57.916 A:middle
Let's avoid going down that

00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:58.896 A:middle
route, and work towards

00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.486 A:middle
optimizing our scene by using a
