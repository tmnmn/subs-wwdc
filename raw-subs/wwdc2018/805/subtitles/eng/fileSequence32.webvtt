And, whether you're an engineer,

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:03.736 A:middle
designer, manager, or an artist,

00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:05.816 A:middle
we wanted to provide you with a

00:32:05.816 --> 00:32:08.046 A:middle
utility belt of tactics and

00:32:08.046 --> 00:32:09.716 A:middle
definitions, so that you are

00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:12.056 A:middle
best equipped to craft your own

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:13.696 A:middle
exceptional AR contents to

00:32:13.696 --> 00:32:14.626 A:middle
delight people with.

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.766 A:middle
So, to begin with, let's start

00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:19.336 A:middle
with some essential concepts to

00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:20.376 A:middle
keep in mind while you're

00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:22.206 A:middle
developing your AR experience.

00:32:22.756 --> 00:32:25.036 A:middle
AR is incredible.

00:32:25.716 --> 00:32:27.176 A:middle
Having the ability to take

00:32:27.176 --> 00:32:28.626 A:middle
anything you can imagine, and

00:32:28.626 --> 00:32:29.966 A:middle
place it into the real world is

00:32:30.056 --> 00:32:31.016 A:middle
absolutely magical.

00:32:31.556 --> 00:32:32.826 A:middle
And, because of this, people

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.766 A:middle
tend to expect a lot out of

00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:35.876 A:middle
their AR experiences.

00:32:37.296 --> 00:32:39.326 A:middle
They expect your 3D content to

00:32:39.406 --> 00:32:40.756 A:middle
render at a smooth and

00:32:40.756 --> 00:32:41.586 A:middle
consistent rate.

00:32:42.316 --> 00:32:43.756 A:middle
It's incredibly distracting when

00:32:43.926 --> 00:32:44.946 A:middle
you're really engaged with the

00:32:44.946 --> 00:32:46.776 A:middle
content, and you start to move a

00:32:46.776 --> 00:32:49.086 A:middle
bit closer to it, and then, you

00:32:49.086 --> 00:32:50.456 A:middle
want to appreciate those fine

00:32:50.456 --> 00:32:51.956 A:middle
details, and all of a sudden,

00:32:52.256 --> 00:32:52.626 A:middle
wham!

00:32:53.456 --> 00:32:54.946 A:middle
Poor optimization has caused

00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:56.616 A:middle
performance to tank, and now

00:32:56.616 --> 00:32:57.446 A:middle
it's as if you're watching a

00:32:57.446 --> 00:32:58.126 A:middle
slideshow.

00:32:59.576 --> 00:33:01.936 A:middle
So, to ensure your -- the most
