00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.246 A:middle
modern 3D rendering.

00:45:00.496 --> 00:45:02.716 A:middle
It's a pretty complex topic that

00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:03.916 A:middle
will take a lot more time than

00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:05.486 A:middle
we actually have in this session

00:45:05.486 --> 00:45:06.156 A:middle
to go over.

00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:08.266 A:middle
But, the basic concept describes

00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:09.856 A:middle
the ability to take the

00:45:09.856 --> 00:45:11.356 A:middle
application of your different

00:45:11.356 --> 00:45:12.796 A:middle
material properties onto your

00:45:12.796 --> 00:45:14.766 A:middle
mesh, in order to have it react

00:45:14.956 --> 00:45:16.666 A:middle
realistically to the simulated

00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.866 A:middle
lights found in your AR scene.

00:45:19.456 --> 00:45:20.546 A:middle
And, moving forward, all the

00:45:20.546 --> 00:45:21.206 A:middle
materials that we'll be

00:45:21.206 --> 00:45:22.696 A:middle
discussing will conform to this

00:45:22.696 --> 00:45:23.436 A:middle
shading technique.

00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:25.296 A:middle
If you want further details

00:45:25.296 --> 00:45:26.376 A:middle
about this concept, there's a

00:45:26.376 --> 00:45:29.596 A:middle
great WWDC 2016 talk that goes

00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:30.896 A:middle
over details about

00:45:30.896 --> 00:45:32.036 A:middle
physically-based rendering as it

00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:33.186 A:middle
applies to SceneKit, called

00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:34.736 A:middle
Advances in SceneKit Rendering.

00:45:34.736 --> 00:45:37.276 A:middle
Now, with that said, let's start

00:45:37.356 --> 00:45:38.466 A:middle
talking about our first material

00:45:38.466 --> 00:45:40.056 A:middle
property, albedo, or what is

00:45:40.056 --> 00:45:41.296 A:middle
sometimes lovingly referred to

00:45:41.296 --> 00:45:42.836 A:middle
as the base or diffuse color

00:45:42.836 --> 00:45:43.316 A:middle
property.

00:45:44.616 --> 00:45:45.516 A:middle
So, let's jump back into

00:45:45.516 --> 00:45:46.076 A:middle
CampfiAR.

00:45:47.016 --> 00:45:48.006 A:middle
Previously our base measure's

00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:48.886 A:middle
looking a little bit boring,

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.066 A:middle
with the gray material

00:45:50.066 --> 00:45:51.626 A:middle
associated with it, but after

00:45:51.676 --> 00:45:52.956 A:middle
you apply albedo, you start to

00:45:52.956 --> 00:45:54.356 A:middle
see that it looks a lot better.

00:45:54.766 --> 00:45:55.756 A:middle
But, the campfire is still

00:45:55.756 --> 00:45:56.996 A:middle
missing a lot of those small,

00:45:57.076 --> 00:45:58.436 A:middle
finite details that were

00:45:58.436 --> 00:45:59.456 A:middle
originally found in that

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.406 A:middle
high-density mesh.
