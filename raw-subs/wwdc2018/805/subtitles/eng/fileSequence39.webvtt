00:38:58.446 --> 00:39:00.806 A:middle
interacted with, you want to

00:39:00.806 --> 00:39:02.566 A:middle
basically create very simple,

00:39:02.896 --> 00:39:04.886 A:middle
low-poly models with a flat

00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:06.316 A:middle
colorful material, so that you

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:07.666 A:middle
can have a ton of them onscreen,

00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:09.106 A:middle
and still have really good

00:39:09.106 --> 00:39:09.696 A:middle
performance.

00:39:10.246 --> 00:39:12.786 A:middle
So, now that we've asked

00:39:12.786 --> 00:39:13.696 A:middle
ourselves these important

00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:15.446 A:middle
questions, it's time to set up

00:39:15.446 --> 00:39:16.366 A:middle
our AR canvas.

00:39:16.766 --> 00:39:17.846 A:middle
Just like painters like to set

00:39:17.846 --> 00:39:19.366 A:middle
up their canvas in space before

00:39:19.366 --> 00:39:20.926 A:middle
they begin work, we would like

00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:22.636 A:middle
to have a couple suggestions of

00:39:22.636 --> 00:39:24.746 A:middle
how to set up your project up

00:39:24.746 --> 00:39:25.856 A:middle
front, in order to position

00:39:25.856 --> 00:39:27.566 A:middle
yourself for optimal success.

00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:31.146 A:middle
We are big fans of creating a

00:39:31.146 --> 00:39:32.366 A:middle
focus square to determine where

00:39:32.366 --> 00:39:33.226 A:middle
to start placing your AR

00:39:33.226 --> 00:39:33.686 A:middle
content.

00:39:34.236 --> 00:39:35.676 A:middle
And, if you're using SceneKit,

00:39:36.016 --> 00:39:36.876 A:middle
right there on the bottom of the

00:39:36.876 --> 00:39:37.886 A:middle
screen, you have the option to

00:39:37.886 --> 00:39:39.266 A:middle
actually activate the statistics

00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:39.566 A:middle
panel.

00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:41.446 A:middle
This will allow you to see your

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:42.616 A:middle
current frames per second, as

00:39:42.616 --> 00:39:44.176 A:middle
well as how many polygons there

00:39:44.176 --> 00:39:45.516 A:middle
are visible on the screen at any

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:46.746 A:middle
given time.

00:39:46.746 --> 00:39:47.656 A:middle
Which should be very helpful as

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:48.796 A:middle
you start to build out your app

00:39:48.796 --> 00:39:49.866 A:middle
and put all the different

00:39:49.866 --> 00:39:50.566 A:middle
elements into it.

00:39:50.566 --> 00:39:53.576 A:middle
So, now that we have a starter

00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:54.976 A:middle
scene up and running, I was

00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:56.396 A:middle
thinking, what will be a good

00:39:56.396 --> 00:39:58.686 A:middle
example AR app to help get over

00:39:58.686 --> 00:39:59.566 A:middle
these best practices?
