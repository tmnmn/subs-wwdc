00:25:57.846 --> 00:26:00.396 A:middle
totally custom interactions for

00:26:00.396 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
your AR apps.

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:02.786 A:middle
And, those can be really

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:03.326 A:middle
natural.

00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:05.456 A:middle
Just like using your device to

00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:06.736 A:middle
look around at different things,

00:26:06.736 --> 00:26:07.766 A:middle
or to get closer and further

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:08.186 A:middle
away.

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:09.856 A:middle
So, let's take a look at an

00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:10.726 A:middle
example of that.

00:26:11.426 --> 00:26:12.886 A:middle
This is Swiftshot, the

00:26:12.886 --> 00:26:14.576 A:middle
multiplayer AR sample game that

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:15.506 A:middle
you might have seen in the

00:26:15.506 --> 00:26:16.306 A:middle
Keynote, or you might have

00:26:16.306 --> 00:26:16.996 A:middle
actually tried it.

00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:19.556 A:middle
In order to fire a slingshot in

00:26:19.556 --> 00:26:21.246 A:middle
Swiftshot, the way you do it is

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.586 A:middle
you move close to that

00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:23.136 A:middle
slingshot.

00:26:23.546 --> 00:26:24.266 A:middle
You don't have to pick which

00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:25.296 A:middle
slingshot you're going to fire

00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:25.976 A:middle
from a list.

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:27.296 A:middle
You don't have to reach out and

00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:28.256 A:middle
try and aim for it on the

00:26:28.256 --> 00:26:28.726 A:middle
screen.

00:26:29.036 --> 00:26:30.906 A:middle
You just move close to it, and

00:26:30.906 --> 00:26:31.716 A:middle
when you want to fire the

00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.516 A:middle
slingshot, you just pull back

00:26:33.516 --> 00:26:34.016 A:middle
and release.

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:37.046 A:middle
So, it's incredibly precise,

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:38.516 A:middle
because you can fire in three

00:26:38.836 --> 00:26:39.386 A:middle
dimensions.

00:26:39.386 --> 00:26:40.366 A:middle
You have three dimensions of

00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:41.976 A:middle
precision while you're moving

00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:42.886 A:middle
that slingshot, while you're

00:26:42.886 --> 00:26:43.546 A:middle
pulling it back.

00:26:44.256 --> 00:26:45.406 A:middle
And, that's more than you could

00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:47.156 A:middle
ever do using touch.

00:26:47.686 --> 00:26:49.196 A:middle
So, moving your device, it's not

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:50.786 A:middle
only really natural, but it's

00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:52.866 A:middle
also more precise than you could

00:26:52.866 --> 00:26:57.836 A:middle
ever do using touch in AR apps.

00:26:58.046 --> 00:26:59.756 A:middle
So, moving your device is great,
