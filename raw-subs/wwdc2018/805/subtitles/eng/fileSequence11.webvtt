00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.266 A:middle
experience, even if it is

00:11:01.266 --> 00:11:02.046 A:middle
through a device.

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:04.676 A:middle
And, there's some benefits to

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:04.946 A:middle
that.

00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:06.466 A:middle
You don't need any extra

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:06.896 A:middle
equipment.

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:07.786 A:middle
It works everywhere.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:09.246 A:middle
You don't need to wear a headset

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:09.936 A:middle
on your head.

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:11.706 A:middle
It works everywhere you are with

00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
the device you already have.

00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:13.946 A:middle
You don't need any kind of

00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:15.446 A:middle
trackers or anything else.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.826 A:middle
And, there's some benefits to

00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:19.626 A:middle
looking through a device rather

00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:21.336 A:middle
than being fully immersed.

00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:22.336 A:middle
Like, you're never going to

00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:23.796 A:middle
accidentally walk into a wall

00:11:23.796 --> 00:11:25.116 A:middle
because you always have your

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:25.986 A:middle
peripheral vision.

00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:28.496 A:middle
So, ARKit can be a great way to

00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:30.066 A:middle
make virtual reality

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:30.826 A:middle
experiences.

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.026 A:middle
We'll take a look at one.

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:35.236 A:middle
So, this is the virtual reality

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.706 A:middle
experience called "Enter the

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:37.116 A:middle
Room."

00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:38.256 A:middle
And, it was developed by the

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:39.636 A:middle
International Committee of the

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:40.296 A:middle
Red Cross.

00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:44.056 A:middle
And, in this experience, once

00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:45.146 A:middle
you walk into the room, you can

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:47.436 A:middle
look around in all directions.

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:49.326 A:middle
You can move closer to things.

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:50.316 A:middle
You can inspect them.

00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:51.496 A:middle
You can move farther away.

00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:54.086 A:middle
And, the sound comes in, and it

00:11:54.086 --> 00:11:55.536 A:middle
feels like it's coming in from

00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:56.796 A:middle
outside the room, from all

00:11:56.796 --> 00:11:57.306 A:middle
around you.

00:11:57.306 --> 00:11:59.446 A:middle
And, that makes it into a really

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:00.716 A:middle
powerful experience.
