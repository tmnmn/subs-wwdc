[going to start off by, I'm going](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=41) [to talk about how to design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=42) [great AR apps and games with the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=44)

then, Omar's going to come](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=49) [up, and he's going to tell you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=50) [all about making 3D models that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=52)

AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=56) [So, before we get to that, I](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=61) [want to quickly talk about the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=63) [basics.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=64) [So, if you're new to it, you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=65) [might be wondering exactly what](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=67) [it is that we mean when we talk](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=69) [about AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=71) [But, even if you're an AR](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=72) [expert, I want to talk about](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=73) [what we mean for this session.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=74) [So, AR, of course, stands for](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=78) [augmented reality.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=80) [And, let's break down what that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=82) [means a little bit.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=83) [And, we can start with reality,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=85) [because it's a little bit easier](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=87) [to get into.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=88) [So, reality means is that AR](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=90) [deals with things in the real](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=92) [world.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=94) [And, that's a little bit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=95) [different than other things we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=96) [might have done on our devices,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=97) [that take place on the device,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=99) [or they take place on the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=101) [internet.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=103) [But, with AR, things happen in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=103) [the real world.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=106) [They happen in the room around](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=108) [you, in the environment you're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=110) [in, or in your place on the map.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=111) [Where you are.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=114) [But, the important thing is,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=115) [it's a little bit different.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=116) [And the other part of augmented](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=118) [And the other part of augmented](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=118) [reality, is augmented.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=120) [And, that can mean a few](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=121) [different things.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=123) [So, augmented can mean -- it can](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=124) [mean augmenting what you know](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=126) [about the world.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=128) [It can mean getting information](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=128) [that the device can understand](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=130) [about the world, and giving that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=131) [to you.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=133) [It can mean placing virtual](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=134) [things out into the world,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=136) [giving the virtual this physical](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=137) [context.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=139) [And, it can mean taking](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=140) [something that is real, like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=141) [your face, when you put an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=143) [animoji on as a mask.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=144) [Taking something that is real,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=146) [and enhancing it, augmenting it.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=147) [So, that's what we mean when we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=150) [talk about AR, when we talk](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=152) [about augmented reality.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=154) [And, with that, I want to get to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=159) [the first half of this session.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=160) [I want to start talking about](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=162) [how to design interfaces, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=163) [design interactions for your AR](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=165) [apps and your AR games.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=167) [And, the first part of that is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=170) [to talk about how to get people](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=172) [into AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=173) [How to help guide people

AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=181) [And then, how you can take those](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=182) [principles, and apply them in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=184) [your own apps.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=186) [Next, we'll talk about the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=188) [different ways you can present](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=190) [content in AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=191) [The different possibilities that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=193) [ARKit opens up, and also some](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=194) [tips and tricks that are great](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=197) [no matter what kind of AR app](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=199) [you're making.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=200) [And finally, we'll talk about](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=201) [interactions in the world.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=203) [It's a little bit different when](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=205) [you're building an AR app than](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=206) [when you're building a 2D app,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=208) [for what kind of interactions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=209) [make sense, and what kind of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=211) [interactions you're going to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=212) [want to use.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=213) [So, we'll figure out what still](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=214) [works great in AR, and then,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=216) [where we might need some new](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=217) [kinds of interactions.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=218) [But first, I want to get started](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=221) [with talking about how to get](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=223) [into AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=224) [And, what I'm talking about here](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=226) [is after somebody's downloaded](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=227) [your app, after they've found](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=229) [the AR experience in the app,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=231) [they've opened it up, what I'm](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=232) [talking about here is when ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=234) [needs to understand the world.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=237) [Because for every AR app, ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=239) [Because for every AR app, ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=239) [needs some level of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=241) [understanding of the world in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=243) [order to start the AR](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=245) [experience.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=246) [In order to get it going.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=247) [Because every AR app needs to --](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=248) [needs that understanding in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=251) [order to place its objects into](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=253) [the world, or show the user that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=254) [information.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=256) [And, the way ARKit builds that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=257) [understanding of the world, is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=260) [by getting you to move your](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=262) [device, by having you move](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=263) [around.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=264) [And, that's a little bit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=265) [different from other places that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=267) [you might have looked through a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=269) [device, seen a camera preview,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=270) [in the past.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=272) [Like, for example, when you're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=274) [taking a photo, you just need to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=275) [point the device where you want](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=277) [to frame the shot.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=278) [But, in AR, you really do need](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=280) [to start moving, looking at the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=282) [same place from different](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=283) [positions, and looking at it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=284) [from some different angles.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=286) [So, the trick here is to let](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=287) [people know what they need to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=291) [do.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=292) [Let them know how to move, that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=292) [they need to move their device.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=294) [And, the way to do that is to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=295) [give them a fixed reference.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=297) [Give them something to base

some](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=868) [annotations into AR, but still](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=870) [make them really readable.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=872) [So, here's an example of

[readable.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=891) [So, screen space text is

[And, even when you're deciding](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1053) [where to place the object here,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1055) [it always stays visible on

[Quicklooking the object from, it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1067) [still shows the

[because touch has been really](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1180) [important all the way back to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1181) [the beginning of iOS.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1183) [Multi-touch was there right from](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1185) [the start, and it's been the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1186) [most important way to interact](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1188) [with our devices.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1189) [And the reason touch is so](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1191) [important, the reason touch is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1193) [so great, is that it enables](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1194) [direct manipulation.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1196) [And, direct manipulation is when](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1198) [And, direct manipulation is when](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1198) [you interact directly with](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1200) [things on the screen, like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1202) [they're physical objects.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1203) [You're not using controls

important](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1215) [in AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1217) [Because in AR, as I said before,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1218) [things are really physical.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1220) [Objects feel like they're real.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1221) [They feel like part of the

important to use](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1226) [direct manipulation to make it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1228) [feel like you're interacting](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1229) [directly with those objects.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1230) [And, direct manipulation is also](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1234) [great because it uses gestures](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1236) [that you already know, that you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1238) [have experience with from iOS.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1240) [Because those gestures will be](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1242) [the same as any other content on](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1244) [iOS.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1246) [They're things that you've been](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1247) [using for probably a long time.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1248) [So, the first one there is how](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1250) [you can move objects in AR with](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1253) [direct manipulation.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1256) [If you want to move objects, you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1257) [just put your finger down and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1259) [just put your finger down and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1259) [drag them to a new place.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1260) [And, it feels like you're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1262) [picking up the object, because](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1262) [it stays under your finger.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1264) [You get this physical connection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1265) [to the thing that you're moving.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1267) [Another gesture you can do, is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1271) [scaling objects.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1273) [So, in AR, things start out at](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1275) [their physical size, at their](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1277) [natural size.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1278) [But, if you want to change that,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1279) [you can pinch the object to make](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1281) [it bigger.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1282) [And, you can pinch out on the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1283) [object if you want to make it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1284) [smaller.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1285) [The important things to think](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1287) [about when you're scaling](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1288) [objects in AR, is to give some](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1289) [feedback when you're doing it.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1291) [Because the change is really,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1292) [really big when you take an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1294) [object and scale it up to 4](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1295) [times the size.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1296) [So, it's important to give](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1298) [people feedback, so they](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1300) [absolutely know what happened.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1301) [And, the second thing is to make](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1303) [it really easy to go -- to take](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1304) [the object back to its natural](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1307) [size.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1308) [Back to the size that it would](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1309) [be in the physical world.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1310) [So, you can snap back to 100%,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1312) [maybe with a haptic, to make](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1314) [that really easy.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1316) [Another thing you can do is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1317) [Another thing you can do is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1317) [rotate objects, by putting two](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1321) [fingers on the display, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1323) [twisting to rotate.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1324) [And, that can be really great,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1327) [but with all of these two finger](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1328) [gestures, another thing you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1329) [should think about is your tap](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1331) [targets.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1332) [Because things in AR are always](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1334) [moving as you're moving the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1335) [device, and they can get really](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1336) [small if you get further away,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1338) [or if you scale them down.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1340) [You should make sure to use](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1341) [really generous tap targets.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1342) [So, it's easy to land two](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1344) [fingers on the object.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1346) [And, be sure to use the center](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1348) [of those two finger touch](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1349) [positions to figure out which](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1351) [object to interact with.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1353) [Because you might not be able to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1354) [land two whole fingers, even on](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1355) [a generous tap target in AR.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1358) [Alright, so direct

[So, let's look at some examples](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1628) [of that.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1629) [And, let's start with

in AR also offers](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1636) [a great example of

want to move an object,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1646) [of course, you can just drag

also touch down](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1654) [to pick up the object and then](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1655) [turn the device and release in

[three-dimensional control of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1663) [moving your device to pick

[That sense of direct](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1676) [manipulation that you had

one](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1700) [way to combine touch.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1702) [But another way to combine touch](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1703) [with moving your device is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1705) [through indirect controls.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1707) [And, what I mean by indirect](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1709) [controls, are controls that

that's really great,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1721) [because that means they get

really](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/?time=1766) [great combined with moving
