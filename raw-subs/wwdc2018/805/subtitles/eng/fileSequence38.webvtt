00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.036 A:middle
building an AR experience

00:38:00.036 --> 00:38:01.676 A:middle
similar to the IKEA Place app,

00:38:02.026 --> 00:38:02.996 A:middle
where people can preview

00:38:02.996 --> 00:38:04.466 A:middle
different pieces of furniture by

00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:06.366 A:middle
being able to place them in

00:38:06.366 --> 00:38:08.056 A:middle
their home, or in our case,

00:38:08.056 --> 00:38:09.056 A:middle
outside on their patio.

00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:11.256 A:middle
Now, the stars of the show are

00:38:11.256 --> 00:38:13.106 A:middle
actually the different furniture

00:38:13.106 --> 00:38:14.776 A:middle
pieces, so you need to present

00:38:14.776 --> 00:38:16.746 A:middle
highly detailed objects that

00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:18.306 A:middle
closely mirror the real world

00:38:18.646 --> 00:38:19.346 A:middle
counterparts.

00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:22.346 A:middle
In this case, it is a good idea

00:38:22.346 --> 00:38:23.976 A:middle
to make sure that you spend a

00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:26.046 A:middle
little extra time in your

00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:27.506 A:middle
rendering budget on these single

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:29.696 A:middle
hero assets, because their level

00:38:29.696 --> 00:38:31.136 A:middle
of quality can essentially make

00:38:31.136 --> 00:38:31.896 A:middle
or break a sale.

00:38:32.556 --> 00:38:35.866 A:middle
On the other hand, you decide

00:38:35.866 --> 00:38:36.776 A:middle
that you've had enough of

00:38:36.776 --> 00:38:37.836 A:middle
accidentally stepping on those

00:38:37.836 --> 00:38:40.766 A:middle
little, tiny, plastic bricks of

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:42.056 A:middle
agonizing pain that your kids

00:38:42.056 --> 00:38:43.106 A:middle
start laying around the house.

00:38:43.106 --> 00:38:44.716 A:middle
So, in order to preserve your

00:38:44.716 --> 00:38:45.766 A:middle
sanity, you build an AR

00:38:45.766 --> 00:38:46.796 A:middle
experience so they can play

00:38:46.796 --> 00:38:47.726 A:middle
around with as many of these

00:38:47.776 --> 00:38:48.936 A:middle
blocks as they can possibly

00:38:48.936 --> 00:38:50.876 A:middle
imagine, similar to Playgrounds

00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:51.116 A:middle
AR.

00:38:51.636 --> 00:38:52.766 A:middle
And, save yourself from ever

00:38:52.766 --> 00:38:54.116 A:middle
having to experience brick pain

00:38:54.116 --> 00:38:54.406 A:middle
again.

00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:56.596 A:middle
In an app like this, where you

00:38:56.596 --> 00:38:57.466 A:middle
potentially have a lot of

00:38:57.466 --> 00:38:58.446 A:middle
objects being rendered and

00:38:58.446 --> 00:39:00.806 A:middle
interacted with, you want to
