00:52:59.206 --> 00:53:01.466 A:middle
And, this is where the roughness

00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:02.446 A:middle
material property comes into

00:53:02.446 --> 00:53:02.736 A:middle
play.

00:53:04.066 --> 00:53:05.516 A:middle
So, returning back to CampfiAR,

00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:07.246 A:middle
you can see how the reflective

00:53:07.246 --> 00:53:08.776 A:middle
surfaces are a bit too smooth.

00:53:09.266 --> 00:53:10.986 A:middle
As we layer on the roughness

00:53:10.986 --> 00:53:12.316 A:middle
maps, you can see that we are

00:53:12.316 --> 00:53:13.746 A:middle
going to modify both the kettle

00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:15.226 A:middle
and the fish to adjust the way

00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.026 A:middle
that they're reflecting.

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:17.816 A:middle
And then, after we apply the

00:53:17.816 --> 00:53:19.316 A:middle
roughness material property to

00:53:19.316 --> 00:53:21.116 A:middle
both of these objects, you can

00:53:21.146 --> 00:53:22.306 A:middle
clearly see the reduction of the

00:53:22.306 --> 00:53:22.926 A:middle
reflectivity.

00:53:23.876 --> 00:53:25.066 A:middle
This combination of roughness

00:53:25.066 --> 00:53:26.516 A:middle
and metalness properties are

00:53:26.516 --> 00:53:28.486 A:middle
another important concept to

00:53:28.486 --> 00:53:28.996 A:middle
focus on.

00:53:29.256 --> 00:53:30.356 A:middle
So, let's dive a little bit

00:53:30.356 --> 00:53:31.396 A:middle
deeper into the roughness

00:53:31.436 --> 00:53:34.086 A:middle
material property.

00:53:34.186 --> 00:53:36.076 A:middle
Use roughness to simulate micro

00:53:36.076 --> 00:53:38.216 A:middle
surface details, which in turn

00:53:38.216 --> 00:53:39.686 A:middle
will affect the way light is

00:53:39.736 --> 00:53:41.216 A:middle
being bounced off that surface.

00:53:41.846 --> 00:53:43.086 A:middle
If the roughness property is set

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:45.236 A:middle
to completely smooth, then light

00:53:45.236 --> 00:53:46.796 A:middle
will bounce off of your surface

00:53:46.796 --> 00:53:47.266 A:middle
like a mirror.

00:53:48.066 --> 00:53:49.196 A:middle
As you increase the roughness of

00:53:49.196 --> 00:53:50.666 A:middle
the material, light reflects

00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:52.006 A:middle
over a wider range of angles.

00:53:52.336 --> 00:53:54.016 A:middle
Here, we're slowly scaling a

00:53:54.016 --> 00:53:55.816 A:middle
constant roughness value between

00:53:56.086 --> 00:53:57.956 A:middle
no roughness to max roughness on

00:53:57.956 --> 00:53:58.786 A:middle
the kettle itself.

00:53:59.386 --> 00:54:02.326 A:middle
And, this is a good way of being
