00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.316 A:middle
Another thing you can do is

00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:03.366 A:middle
rotate objects, by putting two

00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:04.946 A:middle
fingers on the display, and

00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:06.036 A:middle
twisting to rotate.

00:22:07.036 --> 00:22:08.296 A:middle
And, that can be really great,

00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:09.606 A:middle
but with all of these two finger

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:11.286 A:middle
gestures, another thing you

00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:12.986 A:middle
should think about is your tap

00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:13.546 A:middle
targets.

00:22:14.186 --> 00:22:15.866 A:middle
Because things in AR are always

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:16.786 A:middle
moving as you're moving the

00:22:16.786 --> 00:22:18.586 A:middle
device, and they can get really

00:22:18.586 --> 00:22:20.086 A:middle
small if you get further away,

00:22:20.086 --> 00:22:21.206 A:middle
or if you scale them down.

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:22.546 A:middle
You should make sure to use

00:22:22.706 --> 00:22:24.406 A:middle
really generous tap targets.

00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:26.096 A:middle
So, it's easy to land two

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.396 A:middle
fingers on the object.

00:22:28.076 --> 00:22:29.556 A:middle
And, be sure to use the center

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:31.656 A:middle
of those two finger touch

00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:33.406 A:middle
positions to figure out which

00:22:33.406 --> 00:22:34.526 A:middle
object to interact with.

00:22:34.876 --> 00:22:35.826 A:middle
Because you might not be able to

00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:38.156 A:middle
land two whole fingers, even on

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:39.766 A:middle
a generous tap target in AR.

00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:43.676 A:middle
Alright, so direct manipulation

00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:45.126 A:middle
is really great in AR.

00:22:45.126 --> 00:22:46.806 A:middle
It's really important because AR

00:22:46.806 --> 00:22:47.536 A:middle
is so physical.

00:22:48.436 --> 00:22:50.686 A:middle
But, it's also not quite enough

00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:51.696 A:middle
for most AR apps.

00:22:51.696 --> 00:22:53.346 A:middle
Because if you have a lot of

00:22:53.346 --> 00:22:54.406 A:middle
objects, it can make it hard to

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:55.376 A:middle
touch the right one.

00:22:55.716 --> 00:22:56.936 A:middle
As I said before, the objects

00:22:56.936 --> 00:22:59.366 A:middle
are always moving on the display

00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
as you're looking at different
