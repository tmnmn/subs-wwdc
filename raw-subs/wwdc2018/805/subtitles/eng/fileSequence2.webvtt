00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:00.026 A:middle
And the other part of augmented

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:01.506 A:middle
reality, is augmented.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.196 A:middle
And, that can mean a few

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:03.976 A:middle
different things.

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:06.236 A:middle
So, augmented can mean -- it can

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:08.036 A:middle
mean augmenting what you know

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:08.696 A:middle
about the world.

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:10.386 A:middle
It can mean getting information

00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:11.636 A:middle
that the device can understand

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:13.536 A:middle
about the world, and giving that

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:14.116 A:middle
to you.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.196 A:middle
It can mean placing virtual

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:17.526 A:middle
things out into the world,

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:19.236 A:middle
giving the virtual this physical

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.006 A:middle
context.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.676 A:middle
And, it can mean taking

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:23.226 A:middle
something that is real, like

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.466 A:middle
your face, when you put an

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:25.826 A:middle
animoji on as a mask.

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:27.436 A:middle
Taking something that is real,

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:29.946 A:middle
and enhancing it, augmenting it.

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:32.536 A:middle
So, that's what we mean when we

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:33.506 A:middle
talk about AR, when we talk

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:34.976 A:middle
about augmented reality.

00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:40.776 A:middle
And, with that, I want to get to

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.156 A:middle
the first half of this session.

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:43.676 A:middle
I want to start talking about

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:45.546 A:middle
how to design interfaces, and

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:47.356 A:middle
design interactions for your AR

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:49.226 A:middle
apps and your AR games.

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:52.126 A:middle
And, the first part of that is

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:53.676 A:middle
to talk about how to get people

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:54.466 A:middle
into AR.

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:56.556 A:middle
How to help guide people into

00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:56.876 A:middle
AR.

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:59.366 A:middle
So, I'll show you how iOS 12's

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.576 A:middle
built-in AR experiences help
