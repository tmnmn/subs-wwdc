00:32:59.576 --> 00:33:01.936 A:middle
So, to ensure your -- the most

00:33:01.936 --> 00:33:03.216 A:middle
smoothest performance at all

00:33:03.216 --> 00:33:04.846 A:middle
times, and to keep people fully

00:33:04.846 --> 00:33:07.456 A:middle
engaged with your AR scene, your

00:33:07.456 --> 00:33:08.366 A:middle
app needs to render at a

00:33:08.366 --> 00:33:10.066 A:middle
recommended target of 60 frames

00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:10.576 A:middle
per second.

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:13.326 A:middle
Now, it's really important to

00:33:13.326 --> 00:33:15.286 A:middle
maintain this target throughout

00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:16.416 A:middle
the entire experience.

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:18.746 A:middle
Really stress test your content.

00:33:19.086 --> 00:33:20.276 A:middle
View it from every possible

00:33:20.276 --> 00:33:20.636 A:middle
angle.

00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:22.636 A:middle
You know, move in close, move

00:33:22.636 --> 00:33:24.006 A:middle
back from it, and just make sure

00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:25.236 A:middle
that the performance does not

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:25.876 A:middle
ever degrade.

00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:29.566 A:middle
You know, maybe someday in the

00:33:29.566 --> 00:33:31.046 A:middle
future, batteries will run for

00:33:31.046 --> 00:33:31.326 A:middle
days.

00:33:32.056 --> 00:33:33.336 A:middle
But, today, make sure that your

00:33:33.336 --> 00:33:35.716 A:middle
experience is able to have as

00:33:35.716 --> 00:33:37.146 A:middle
minimal of an impact to battery

00:33:37.146 --> 00:33:38.326 A:middle
life as possible.

00:33:39.086 --> 00:33:40.536 A:middle
Don't give people the chance to

00:33:40.536 --> 00:33:41.976 A:middle
blame your app for draining

00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:42.466 A:middle
their battery.

00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:44.566 A:middle
The more power you save, the

00:33:44.566 --> 00:33:45.666 A:middle
more you want people to come

00:33:45.666 --> 00:33:46.906 A:middle
back to your experience and try

00:33:46.906 --> 00:33:47.296 A:middle
it again.

00:33:47.906 --> 00:33:50.476 A:middle
I mean, I don't know about you,

00:33:50.476 --> 00:33:51.696 A:middle
but whenever I see a battery

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.906 A:middle
indicator in this stake, I

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.136 A:middle
seriously feel like I'm going to

00:33:54.136 --> 00:33:55.046 A:middle
have a panic attack.

00:33:55.376 --> 00:33:56.516 A:middle
And, we definitely don't want to

00:33:56.516 --> 00:33:57.896 A:middle
have our AR experiences cause

00:33:58.006 --> 00:33:59.466 A:middle
widespread battery chaos

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.536 A:middle
throughout the lands.
