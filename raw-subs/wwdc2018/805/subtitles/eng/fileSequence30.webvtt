00:29:59.406 --> 00:30:00.346 A:middle
add button at the bottom of the

00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
screen to add points.

00:30:02.756 --> 00:30:04.696 A:middle
And, that control is in a really

00:30:04.696 --> 00:30:05.566 A:middle
reachable spot.

00:30:05.946 --> 00:30:07.086 A:middle
So, even while you're using one

00:30:07.086 --> 00:30:09.026 A:middle
hand to focus the reticle on the

00:30:09.026 --> 00:30:10.946 A:middle
center of the screen, to

00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:11.906 A:middle
precisely place your

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:13.546 A:middle
measurements, you can keep a

00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:15.046 A:middle
finger placed above that plus

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.716 A:middle
button to easily add your

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:17.846 A:middle
measurements, to easily place

00:30:17.846 --> 00:30:18.436 A:middle
those points.

00:30:19.576 --> 00:30:22.096 A:middle
So, using indirect controls can

00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:24.026 A:middle
be a great way to make it not

00:30:24.026 --> 00:30:25.846 A:middle
only easy to use AR experiences,

00:30:25.946 --> 00:30:31.286 A:middle
but one-handed ones as well.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.196 A:middle
Alright. So, that's how to pick

00:30:33.196 --> 00:30:34.476 A:middle
interactions for AR.

00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:36.566 A:middle
You can use direct manipulation

00:30:36.866 --> 00:30:37.486 A:middle
to give that sense of

00:30:37.486 --> 00:30:39.236 A:middle
physicality, and physical

00:30:39.236 --> 00:30:40.006 A:middle
interaction.

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:41.716 A:middle
You can move the device, the

00:30:41.856 --> 00:30:43.486 A:middle
primary interaction in AR.

00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:45.056 A:middle
And, you can use really

00:30:45.056 --> 00:30:47.086 A:middle
reachable indirect controls to

00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:48.896 A:middle
focus on the content, rather

00:30:48.896 --> 00:30:51.036 A:middle
than on controls or buttons

00:30:51.036 --> 00:30:51.846 A:middle
interacting with it.

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:54.086 A:middle
And, that's what I wanted to

00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:55.066 A:middle
talk to you about today.

00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:57.626 A:middle
Getting into AR, guiding people

00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:59.006 A:middle
down the right path, and giving

00:30:59.006 --> 00:31:00.786 A:middle
them that direct feedback that
