00:23:59.826 --> 00:24:00.666 A:middle
little bit further.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.746 A:middle
But, the important part is that

00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:05.446 A:middle
moving your device is fully

00:24:05.446 --> 00:24:06.236 A:middle
three-dimensional, and that

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.676 A:middle
really makes it the number one,

00:24:07.676 --> 00:24:09.756 A:middle
the primary interaction in AR.

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:12.506 A:middle
In fact, I would say that moving

00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:14.166 A:middle
your device is more important

00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:17.096 A:middle
than touch for AR apps.

00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:18.766 A:middle
In fact, it's so natural, it's

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:21.356 A:middle
built in to every AR app by

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:21.886 A:middle
default.

00:24:22.376 --> 00:24:23.156 A:middle
The way that you look at

00:24:23.156 --> 00:24:24.726 A:middle
different things in AR is by

00:24:24.726 --> 00:24:26.676 A:middle
moving your device to look at it

00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:27.886 A:middle
from different angles, and

00:24:27.886 --> 00:24:28.726 A:middle
different positions.

00:24:29.326 --> 00:24:31.206 A:middle
So, it's really natural, and

00:24:31.206 --> 00:24:32.506 A:middle
it's also really powerful.

00:24:34.176 --> 00:24:35.506 A:middle
And, moving your device, it

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:37.066 A:middle
accomplishes many of the things

00:24:37.436 --> 00:24:38.766 A:middle
that you would have done in a 2D

00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.746 A:middle
app by using multi-touch.

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:42.846 A:middle
So, in a 2D app, if you want to

00:24:42.846 --> 00:24:44.756 A:middle
see more content, the way you do

00:24:44.756 --> 00:24:45.996 A:middle
that is by scrolling on the

00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:46.646 A:middle
display.

00:24:46.966 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
You scroll down to see something

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:48.726 A:middle
new.

00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:51.206 A:middle
And, that's great in a 2D app,

00:24:51.956 --> 00:24:54.656 A:middle
but in AR, you do that in 3D.

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.456 A:middle
You see different content, by

00:24:56.456 --> 00:24:59.006 A:middle
moving your device to look at

00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
the content from different
