them that direct feedback that

00:31:00.786 --> 00:31:01.896 A:middle
they're doing the right thing.

00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:03.706 A:middle
The ways you can present your

00:31:03.706 --> 00:31:06.866 A:middle
content in 2D and VR, and how

00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:08.826 A:middle
you can show content to make it

00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:10.316 A:middle
easy to read, and give objects

00:31:10.316 --> 00:31:11.436 A:middle
that physical identity

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.006 A:middle
transitioning in and out of AR.

00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:15.666 A:middle
And, the interactions that you

00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:18.286 A:middle
can use in the world, especially

00:31:18.506 --> 00:31:20.016 A:middle
and primarily moving your

00:31:20.016 --> 00:31:20.646 A:middle
device.

00:31:20.936 --> 00:31:23.276 A:middle
So, now I want to bring up Omar,

00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:24.256 A:middle
who's going to talk about making

00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:26.126 A:middle
your models, your 3D models look

00:31:26.206 --> 00:31:27.376 A:middle
really great in AR.

00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:27.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:31:28.516 --> 00:31:35.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:40.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Grant.

00:31:44.816 --> 00:31:45.726 A:middle
Hey, everyone.

00:31:46.346 --> 00:31:47.916 A:middle
I'm really excited to be up here

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:48.956 A:middle
to talk about some best

00:31:48.956 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
practices that you need to keep

00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:52.036 A:middle
in mind while you're developing

00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:54.396 A:middle
your content for your AR

00:31:54.396 --> 00:31:55.136 A:middle
experiences.

00:31:55.386 --> 00:31:57.756 A:middle
So, we have a lot of different

00:31:57.756 --> 00:31:58.786 A:middle
pieces of information to cover

00:31:58.786 --> 00:31:59.156 A:middle
today.

00:31:59.156 --> 00:32:00.896 A:middle
And, whether you're an engineer,
