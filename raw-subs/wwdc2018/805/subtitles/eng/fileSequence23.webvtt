00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
as you're looking at different

00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:01.166 A:middle
places in the world.

00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:02.456 A:middle
And, they're staying fixed to

00:23:02.456 --> 00:23:03.446 A:middle
that place in the world.

00:23:03.446 --> 00:23:05.256 A:middle
So, it can be a little hard to

00:23:05.316 --> 00:23:07.096 A:middle
aim for those objects on the

00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:07.666 A:middle
screen.

00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:10.786 A:middle
But, the fundamental reason, the

00:23:10.786 --> 00:23:12.226 A:middle
number one reason, the real

00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:15.206 A:middle
reason that touch is not enough

00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:17.266 A:middle
for AR apps, is that it's

00:23:17.266 --> 00:23:18.826 A:middle
fundamentally two-dimensional.

00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:20.846 A:middle
The surface of the display is

00:23:20.846 --> 00:23:22.006 A:middle
two-dimensional, and you're

00:23:22.006 --> 00:23:23.236 A:middle
touching on that surface.

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:25.126 A:middle
That is what made it so great,

00:23:25.126 --> 00:23:27.566 A:middle
multi-touch so great for flat,

00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:28.936 A:middle
2D apps in iOS.

00:23:29.596 --> 00:23:31.376 A:middle
But, AR content, it's placed

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:32.026 A:middle
into the world.

00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:33.226 A:middle
It's part of the world.

00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:35.856 A:middle
So, that means we need some way

00:23:35.856 --> 00:23:37.266 A:middle
to interact with that content

00:23:37.636 --> 00:23:38.846 A:middle
also in three dimensions.

00:23:38.966 --> 00:23:40.196 A:middle
Because the world is

00:23:40.196 --> 00:23:40.866 A:middle
three-dimensional.

00:23:42.576 --> 00:23:44.566 A:middle
The answer there is moving your

00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:45.186 A:middle
device.

00:23:45.646 --> 00:23:47.026 A:middle
Because moving your device, it's

00:23:47.026 --> 00:23:48.436 A:middle
natively three-dimensional.

00:23:48.796 --> 00:23:49.686 A:middle
It's three-dimensional

00:23:49.686 --> 00:23:50.286 A:middle
inherently.

00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:51.966 A:middle
You can move up and down.

00:23:52.176 --> 00:23:53.126 A:middle
You can move left and right.

00:23:53.126 --> 00:23:54.826 A:middle
You can move forward and back.

00:23:55.136 --> 00:23:56.506 A:middle
You can turn in all directions.

00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:58.446 A:middle
You can stand up and move across

00:23:58.486 --> 00:23:59.826 A:middle
the room if you want to go a

00:23:59.826 --> 00:24:00.666 A:middle
little bit further.
