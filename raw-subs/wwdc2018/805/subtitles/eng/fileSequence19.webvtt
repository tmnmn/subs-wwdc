00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:00.336 A:middle
up reading things on iOS.

00:19:01.046 --> 00:19:03.566 A:middle
And finally, we talked about

00:19:03.566 --> 00:19:05.766 A:middle
transitioning into AR, and out

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:08.436 A:middle
of AR, for showing details flat

00:19:08.436 --> 00:19:09.266 A:middle
on the display.

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:11.066 A:middle
But, also to give objects that

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.676 A:middle
sense of identity, that sense of

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:14.826 A:middle
physicality that's so important

00:19:14.826 --> 00:19:14.976 A:middle
in AR.

00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:21.246 A:middle
Alright. So, that's presenting

00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:22.026 A:middle
content in AR.

00:19:22.026 --> 00:19:23.196 A:middle
So, different ways that you can

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:23.916 A:middle
present it.

00:19:23.916 --> 00:19:25.726 A:middle
And some tips for different

00:19:26.136 --> 00:19:27.246 A:middle
types of content that you're

00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:28.586 A:middle
going to want to show in your AR

00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:28.936 A:middle
apps.

00:19:30.226 --> 00:19:31.906 A:middle
Now, let's talk about how we can

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:33.636 A:middle
interact with that content.

00:19:33.636 --> 00:19:35.006 A:middle
Let's talk about interactions

00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:36.736 A:middle
that make sense in the world.

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:39.666 A:middle
And, let's start with touch,

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:41.786 A:middle
because touch has been really

00:19:41.786 --> 00:19:43.646 A:middle
important all the way back to

00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:44.876 A:middle
the beginning of iOS.

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.636 A:middle
Multi-touch was there right from

00:19:46.636 --> 00:19:48.286 A:middle
the start, and it's been the

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.836 A:middle
most important way to interact

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:50.586 A:middle
with our devices.

00:19:51.706 --> 00:19:53.026 A:middle
And the reason touch is so

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.386 A:middle
important, the reason touch is

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:56.506 A:middle
so great, is that it enables

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:57.606 A:middle
direct manipulation.

00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
And, direct manipulation is when
