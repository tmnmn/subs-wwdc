00:53:59.386 --> 00:54:02.326 A:middle
And, this is a good way of being

00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:04.486 A:middle
able to simulate the concept of

00:54:04.486 --> 00:54:06.456 A:middle
having microsurfaces, and

00:54:06.456 --> 00:54:07.606 A:middle
blurring reflection to the point

00:54:07.606 --> 00:54:09.396 A:middle
where you might not see any

00:54:09.396 --> 00:54:10.706 A:middle
reflectivity depending on which

00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:13.106 A:middle
range you put your value to.

00:54:13.576 --> 00:54:16.536 A:middle
So, for the kettle, we've taken

00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:17.746 A:middle
the original metal surface, and

00:54:17.746 --> 00:54:19.416 A:middle
instead of just applying a

00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:21.476 A:middle
constant roughness value to it,

00:54:21.876 --> 00:54:23.006 A:middle
we actually applied a roughness

00:54:23.006 --> 00:54:23.176 A:middle
map.

00:54:24.086 --> 00:54:25.436 A:middle
And, this will help designate

00:54:25.706 --> 00:54:27.146 A:middle
the surfaces where we will be

00:54:27.146 --> 00:54:29.656 A:middle
scattering the light more often,

00:54:29.656 --> 00:54:30.786 A:middle
and more than others.

00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:32.956 A:middle
Once we've applied the roughness

00:54:32.956 --> 00:54:34.926 A:middle
map, we get to see the real

00:54:34.926 --> 00:54:36.346 A:middle
final look of the reflectiveness

00:54:36.346 --> 00:54:37.346 A:middle
of this kettle, which is a lot

00:54:37.346 --> 00:54:38.906 A:middle
less shiny as before.

00:54:40.106 --> 00:54:42.406 A:middle
Now, a combination of this

00:54:42.486 --> 00:54:43.826 A:middle
metalness property and this

00:54:43.826 --> 00:54:45.586 A:middle
roughness property really make

00:54:45.586 --> 00:54:46.976 A:middle
your reflective AR models look

00:54:46.976 --> 00:54:47.566 A:middle
phenomenal.

00:54:48.486 --> 00:54:49.656 A:middle
Roughness can be used to tweak

00:54:49.656 --> 00:54:50.926 A:middle
how much of your objects will

00:54:50.926 --> 00:54:51.756 A:middle
reflect the environment.

00:54:52.046 --> 00:54:53.586 A:middle
And, can really be used to add a

00:54:53.586 --> 00:54:54.636 A:middle
lot more realism to your

00:54:54.636 --> 00:54:55.626 A:middle
metallic surfaces.

00:54:56.296 --> 00:54:57.706 A:middle
You can use this roughness map

00:54:57.826 --> 00:55:00.076 A:middle
to add additional minor details
