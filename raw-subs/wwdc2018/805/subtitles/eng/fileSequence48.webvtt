00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:01.236 A:middle
So, how do we make this normal

00:48:01.236 --> 00:48:01.446 A:middle
map?

00:48:02.146 --> 00:48:03.196 A:middle
Let's see a closer look at one

00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:05.156 A:middle
of the branches, and see what we

00:48:05.156 --> 00:48:06.216 A:middle
can do to make this work.

00:48:06.626 --> 00:48:07.936 A:middle
In most modern 3D modeling

00:48:07.936 --> 00:48:09.346 A:middle
applications, artists have the

00:48:09.346 --> 00:48:10.406 A:middle
ability to generate these normal

00:48:10.406 --> 00:48:12.496 A:middle
maps by projecting details from

00:48:12.496 --> 00:48:14.236 A:middle
a high-density mesh over to a

00:48:14.236 --> 00:48:14.986 A:middle
low-density one.

00:48:15.546 --> 00:48:16.556 A:middle
So, here you can see what the

00:48:16.556 --> 00:48:17.936 A:middle
normal map looks like on the

00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:19.176 A:middle
branches after they've been

00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:20.636 A:middle
generated from this high-density

00:48:20.636 --> 00:48:21.046 A:middle
mesh.

00:48:21.756 --> 00:48:23.296 A:middle
And, after applying the normal

00:48:23.296 --> 00:48:24.786 A:middle
map, you start to notice all

00:48:24.786 --> 00:48:25.826 A:middle
those nice details that were

00:48:25.826 --> 00:48:27.276 A:middle
originally lost come back into

00:48:27.276 --> 00:48:27.756 A:middle
this model.

00:48:27.756 --> 00:48:28.876 A:middle
But we still are able to

00:48:28.876 --> 00:48:30.446 A:middle
maintain that high performance,

00:48:30.496 --> 00:48:31.656 A:middle
of the low-poly mesh.

00:48:31.656 --> 00:48:34.386 A:middle
So, you may be wondering why the

00:48:34.416 --> 00:48:35.456 A:middle
normal map looks kind of

00:48:35.456 --> 00:48:37.356 A:middle
strange, well the colors of the

00:48:37.356 --> 00:48:38.836 A:middle
normal map actually represent

00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:40.626 A:middle
visual representations of the

00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:41.236 A:middle
vector data.

00:48:41.236 --> 00:48:43.816 A:middle
And, determine how the normals

00:48:43.816 --> 00:48:45.446 A:middle
on the surface model will be

00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:47.866 A:middle
offset in order to change the

00:48:47.866 --> 00:48:48.566 A:middle
way that light is being

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:50.526 A:middle
reflected, and our key to making

00:48:50.526 --> 00:48:51.196 A:middle
this effect work.

00:48:51.706 --> 00:48:53.766 A:middle
That was a bit of a mouthful, so

00:48:53.766 --> 00:48:54.936 A:middle
let's dive a little bit more

00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:57.006 A:middle
into this property, because

00:48:57.276 --> 00:48:58.636 A:middle
normals we feel are a really

00:48:58.636 --> 00:48:59.326 A:middle
important topic.

00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:00.946 A:middle
And, we want to spend a couple
