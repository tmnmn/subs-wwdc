00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:00.576 A:middle
place, or rotate it.

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.036 A:middle
And then, once you've started

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:06.056 A:middle
moving the device, the surface

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:07.616 A:middle
transitions into a cube.

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:10.806 A:middle
And, that cube spins with the

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.206 A:middle
movement of the device, giving

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:13.666 A:middle
you real, connected, direct

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.196 A:middle
feedback that you're on the

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:16.916 A:middle
right path, and you're doing the

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:17.506 A:middle
right thing.

00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:20.276 A:middle
And then, once ARKit has built

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.406 A:middle
that understanding, it's all

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.946 A:middle
ready, the cube spins away, and

00:07:23.946 --> 00:07:25.516 A:middle
you're ready to go in your AR

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:25.966 A:middle
experience.

00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:30.896 A:middle
So, that's how the built-in apps

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:33.256 A:middle
in iOS 12 help guide people into

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:33.526 A:middle
AR.

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:35.276 A:middle
And, your apps should follow

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:36.446 A:middle
those same principles.

00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:38.636 A:middle
They should help people know

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:39.476 A:middle
that they need to move their

00:07:39.476 --> 00:07:41.016 A:middle
device, and give them that

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:42.126 A:middle
feedback that they're doing the

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:42.806 A:middle
right thing.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.586 A:middle
But, your apps don't need to

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:45.786 A:middle
follow that same style.

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:46.666 A:middle
They don't need to look like

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.066 A:middle
line drawings.

00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:48.886 A:middle
AR should feel like an

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:50.306 A:middle
integrated part of your app.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:52.406 A:middle
It should feel native to your

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:53.206 A:middle
app's style.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.466 A:middle
And, it shouldn't feel like

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:56.256 A:middle
something that's attached on, or

00:07:56.256 --> 00:07:58.026 A:middle
this flow is something that's

00:07:58.026 --> 00:07:59.106 A:middle
added on after the fact.

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:01.186 A:middle
So, the important part is to
