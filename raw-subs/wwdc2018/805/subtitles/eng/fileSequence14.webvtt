00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:00.086 A:middle
It's always head-on.

00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:01.896 A:middle
And, that makes it really easy

00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:02.186 A:middle
to read.

00:14:02.186 --> 00:14:03.596 A:middle
It doesn't have those problems

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:05.236 A:middle
of what angle you're looking at,

00:14:05.576 --> 00:14:06.946 A:middle
or how far away from it you are.

00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:09.546 A:middle
But, the important part of

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:11.806 A:middle
showing text in screen space, is

00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:13.626 A:middle
that it's still attached to a

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:14.706 A:middle
position in the world.

00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:16.976 A:middle
It's still fixed to the place in

00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:18.166 A:middle
the world that you attach it to

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:20.476 A:middle
an object, or attach it to some

00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:21.366 A:middle
physical feature.

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.166 A:middle
And, that makes it really feel

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.866 A:middle
like part of the AR scene.

00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:28.796 A:middle
So, screen space text is a great

00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:30.096 A:middle
way to label things, put some

00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:32.646 A:middle
annotations into AR, but still

00:14:32.646 --> 00:14:33.946 A:middle
make them really readable.

00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:37.166 A:middle
So, here's an example of screen

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:37.626 A:middle
space text.

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.906 A:middle
And, this is from Measure, which

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:41.126 A:middle
is part of iOS 12.

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:43.046 A:middle
When Measure shows the

00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:44.616 A:middle
measurements, it shows them in

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:45.626 A:middle
screen space.

00:14:45.796 --> 00:14:47.046 A:middle
So, no matter what angle you're

00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:48.016 A:middle
looking at those measurements

00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:49.866 A:middle
from, or how far away you are,

00:14:50.546 --> 00:14:51.756 A:middle
they're always incredibly

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:51.976 A:middle
readable.

00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:59.126 A:middle
So, screen space text is great

00:14:59.126 --> 00:14:59.956 A:middle
for readability.
