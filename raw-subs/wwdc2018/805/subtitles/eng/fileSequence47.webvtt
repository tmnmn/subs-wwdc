00:46:59.726 --> 00:47:01.056 A:middle
that are neither too bright or

00:47:01.056 --> 00:47:01.416 A:middle
dark.

00:47:01.956 --> 00:47:03.776 A:middle
As, you want this to work in a

00:47:03.816 --> 00:47:04.746 A:middle
wide variety of different

00:47:04.746 --> 00:47:05.456 A:middle
situations.

00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:07.856 A:middle
So, our fish has got a skin, but

00:47:07.856 --> 00:47:08.886 A:middle
we're still missing a lot of

00:47:08.886 --> 00:47:10.286 A:middle
details from this, and the other

00:47:10.286 --> 00:47:11.746 A:middle
objects found in the scene.

00:47:12.136 --> 00:47:13.626 A:middle
So let's go back into how we can

00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:14.636 A:middle
start bringing back a lot of

00:47:14.636 --> 00:47:16.866 A:middle
those details through the use of

00:47:16.866 --> 00:47:18.236 A:middle
the normal material property.

00:47:18.296 --> 00:47:20.656 A:middle
So, as we jump back into

00:47:20.656 --> 00:47:22.466 A:middle
CampfiAR, let's see how we can

00:47:22.466 --> 00:47:23.916 A:middle
bring back some of those details

00:47:23.916 --> 00:47:25.436 A:middle
that we moved from optimization.

00:47:26.166 --> 00:47:27.476 A:middle
This can be done through the use

00:47:27.476 --> 00:47:28.676 A:middle
of a special texture called a

00:47:28.676 --> 00:47:30.706 A:middle
normal map, which you can see

00:47:30.706 --> 00:47:32.056 A:middle
here as the blue tinted maps

00:47:32.056 --> 00:47:33.476 A:middle
that are now applied to our AR

00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:33.786 A:middle
scene.

00:47:34.576 --> 00:47:36.016 A:middle
These maps allow you to add

00:47:36.046 --> 00:47:38.276 A:middle
those fine surface details back

00:47:38.276 --> 00:47:39.526 A:middle
into your models, without the

00:47:39.526 --> 00:47:40.876 A:middle
need to add any additional

00:47:40.876 --> 00:47:41.336 A:middle
geometry.

00:47:42.036 --> 00:47:43.276 A:middle
Now, after applying the normal

00:47:43.276 --> 00:47:45.046 A:middle
maps, you can see how the fish

00:47:45.046 --> 00:47:46.676 A:middle
exhibits some scales, as well as

00:47:46.676 --> 00:47:48.306 A:middle
making the branches show just a

00:47:48.306 --> 00:47:49.256 A:middle
tiny bit more detail.

00:47:49.966 --> 00:47:51.276 A:middle
Also if you take a look at the

00:47:51.276 --> 00:47:52.296 A:middle
statistics panel, you'll notice

00:47:52.296 --> 00:47:53.456 A:middle
that there was absolutely no

00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:55.256 A:middle
change in the number of polygons

00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:56.176 A:middle
related to this model.

00:47:56.336 --> 00:47:58.946 A:middle
It's magical, isn't it?

00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:01.236 A:middle
So, how do we make this normal
