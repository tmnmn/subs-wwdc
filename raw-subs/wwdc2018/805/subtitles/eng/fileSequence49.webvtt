00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:00.946 A:middle
And, we want to spend a couple

00:49:00.946 --> 00:49:02.846 A:middle
more minutes just going into how

00:49:02.846 --> 00:49:04.786 A:middle
truly spectacular these can be.

00:49:06.156 --> 00:49:07.206 A:middle
The art of manipulating normal

00:49:07.206 --> 00:49:08.626 A:middle
vectors are one of the key tools

00:49:08.626 --> 00:49:10.396 A:middle
that AR creators have in order

00:49:10.396 --> 00:49:12.906 A:middle
to add a lot of the significant

00:49:12.906 --> 00:49:14.416 A:middle
details back into their model.

00:49:15.076 --> 00:49:16.706 A:middle
So, what the heck is a normal

00:49:16.706 --> 00:49:18.206 A:middle
vector, and are there strange

00:49:18.206 --> 00:49:19.016 A:middle
vectors as well?

00:49:19.696 --> 00:49:20.916 A:middle
Well, no there's no strange

00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:21.926 A:middle
vectors unless you forgot your

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:24.046 A:middle
high school trig, but normal

00:49:24.046 --> 00:49:25.566 A:middle
vectors lie perpendicular to the

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:26.906 A:middle
surface of the mesh, and are

00:49:26.906 --> 00:49:28.146 A:middle
associated with each mesh

00:49:28.146 --> 00:49:28.766 A:middle
vertex.

00:49:29.436 --> 00:49:30.266 A:middle
So, why do we need these

00:49:30.266 --> 00:49:30.746 A:middle
normals?

00:49:31.246 --> 00:49:33.406 A:middle
Well, in order to see our

00:49:33.406 --> 00:49:34.666 A:middle
object, you need to place

00:49:34.716 --> 00:49:36.416 A:middle
simulated lights into your 3D

00:49:36.416 --> 00:49:36.936 A:middle
engine.

00:49:37.796 --> 00:49:39.446 A:middle
Normal vectors allow 3D engines

00:49:39.446 --> 00:49:40.826 A:middle
to calculate how these lights

00:49:40.826 --> 00:49:41.906 A:middle
are actually reflected off the

00:49:41.906 --> 00:49:43.126 A:middle
surface of these materials.

00:49:43.616 --> 00:49:45.026 A:middle
Similar to how light behaves in

00:49:45.026 --> 00:49:46.156 A:middle
the real world, and are

00:49:46.156 --> 00:49:47.376 A:middle
essential to making sure that

00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:49.286 A:middle
your AR scenes mimic reality.

00:49:49.846 --> 00:49:52.016 A:middle
What's interesting is that by

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:53.786 A:middle
modifying these normals, you can

00:49:53.786 --> 00:49:54.906 A:middle
trick the engine to thinking

00:49:54.906 --> 00:49:56.156 A:middle
that your surface is actually

00:49:56.156 --> 00:49:57.756 A:middle
more detailed than it really is,

00:49:58.136 --> 00:49:59.276 A:middle
without need to add any

00:49:59.276 --> 00:49:59.946 A:middle
additional geometry.
