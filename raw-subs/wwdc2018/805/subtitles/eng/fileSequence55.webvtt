00:54:57.826 --> 00:55:00.076 A:middle
to add additional minor details

00:55:00.076 --> 00:55:01.436 A:middle
as we've done here, to make our

00:55:01.436 --> 00:55:02.366 A:middle
kettle look a little more

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:02.946 A:middle
scuffed up.

00:55:04.066 --> 00:55:05.726 A:middle
Now, to close out materials, we

00:55:05.726 --> 00:55:06.316 A:middle
have two more material

00:55:06.316 --> 00:55:07.356 A:middle
properties that I want to

00:55:07.356 --> 00:55:09.256 A:middle
discuss to further refine your

00:55:09.256 --> 00:55:11.546 A:middle
models, and have a good balance

00:55:11.546 --> 00:55:12.646 A:middle
between performance and

00:55:12.646 --> 00:55:13.276 A:middle
aesthetics.

00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:16.416 A:middle
Ambient occlusion is a material

00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:17.686 A:middle
property that is used to provide

00:55:17.686 --> 00:55:20.216 A:middle
your model with self-shadowing,

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:21.476 A:middle
which in turn can lead to adding

00:55:21.476 --> 00:55:23.016 A:middle
additional depth and details to

00:55:23.016 --> 00:55:23.856 A:middle
your AR models.

00:55:24.416 --> 00:55:27.026 A:middle
Now, while normal maps are great

00:55:27.286 --> 00:55:28.296 A:middle
for applying significant amount

00:55:28.296 --> 00:55:30.486 A:middle
of details back into your AR

00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:32.296 A:middle
model, you can use ambient

00:55:32.296 --> 00:55:33.946 A:middle
occlusion to really hammer in

00:55:34.096 --> 00:55:34.796 A:middle
those details.

00:55:35.336 --> 00:55:36.386 A:middle
Here, we're visualizing the

00:55:36.386 --> 00:55:37.496 A:middle
ambient occlusion maps for

00:55:37.646 --> 00:55:39.786 A:middle
CampfiAR, and it's a bit of a

00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:41.036 A:middle
difficult effect to demonstrate,

00:55:41.036 --> 00:55:42.246 A:middle
as it's meant to be relatively

00:55:42.246 --> 00:55:42.616 A:middle
subtle.

00:55:42.616 --> 00:55:44.226 A:middle
But, see if you can notice the

00:55:44.226 --> 00:55:45.806 A:middle
additional shadows on the logs,

00:55:45.896 --> 00:55:47.086 A:middle
as well as certain areas near

00:55:47.086 --> 00:55:48.006 A:middle
the bottom of the kettle.

00:55:48.826 --> 00:55:50.336 A:middle
In our case here, it's kind of

00:55:50.336 --> 00:55:51.456 A:middle
like playing Where's Waldo?

00:55:51.456 --> 00:55:53.356 A:middle
with shadows, so let's focus in

00:55:53.356 --> 00:55:56.876 A:middle
on the logs in the scene.

00:55:57.086 --> 00:55:58.726 A:middle
So, here we're showing you the

00:55:58.726 --> 00:56:00.686 A:middle
normal maped logs before.
