00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.406 A:middle
high-density mesh.

00:46:01.076 --> 00:46:02.096 A:middle
As you move closer to the

00:46:02.096 --> 00:46:04.046 A:middle
campfire, you'll notice that all

00:46:04.046 --> 00:46:05.016 A:middle
the surfaces are relatively

00:46:05.016 --> 00:46:05.366 A:middle
flat.

00:46:05.936 --> 00:46:06.846 A:middle
And, this is something that

00:46:06.846 --> 00:46:07.906 A:middle
we'll definitely correct later,

00:46:07.906 --> 00:46:09.146 A:middle
but first let's dive into the

00:46:09.146 --> 00:46:10.186 A:middle
albedo property a little bit

00:46:10.186 --> 00:46:10.446 A:middle
more.

00:46:12.016 --> 00:46:13.966 A:middle
Think of the albedo as basically

00:46:13.966 --> 00:46:15.266 A:middle
being the base mesh of the

00:46:15.266 --> 00:46:16.326 A:middle
various objects in your AR

00:46:16.326 --> 00:46:16.656 A:middle
scene.

00:46:17.526 --> 00:46:18.496 A:middle
This is the material property

00:46:18.496 --> 00:46:20.246 A:middle
that you typically use to apply

00:46:20.476 --> 00:46:22.076 A:middle
textures to the surface of your

00:46:22.076 --> 00:46:22.376 A:middle
model.

00:46:23.376 --> 00:46:24.676 A:middle
If you recall, your mesh

00:46:24.676 --> 00:46:25.846 A:middle
contained different vertices,

00:46:25.846 --> 00:46:26.946 A:middle
that held different pieces of

00:46:26.946 --> 00:46:27.586 A:middle
information.

00:46:28.856 --> 00:46:29.916 A:middle
The ones you see here are

00:46:29.916 --> 00:46:31.286 A:middle
actually called UV coordinates,

00:46:31.336 --> 00:46:33.166 A:middle
which help map out how pixels

00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:34.236 A:middle
from various texture maps are

00:46:34.236 --> 00:46:35.576 A:middle
actually applied to the model.

00:46:36.606 --> 00:46:37.996 A:middle
And, after we've worked with

00:46:37.996 --> 00:46:39.746 A:middle
these textures, we've applied

00:46:39.746 --> 00:46:41.356 A:middle
the abel material to this

00:46:41.356 --> 00:46:42.576 A:middle
property on the fish.

00:46:43.996 --> 00:46:45.286 A:middle
So, now we've essentially

00:46:45.286 --> 00:46:46.886 A:middle
applied a texture to our fish, I

00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:47.856 A:middle
want to remind you about the

00:46:47.856 --> 00:46:49.656 A:middle
fact that you never know where

00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:50.206 A:middle
people are never going to

00:46:50.206 --> 00:46:51.126 A:middle
experience your app.

00:46:51.776 --> 00:46:52.896 A:middle
You want to be able to have your

00:46:52.986 --> 00:46:54.506 A:middle
content fit in as many different

00:46:54.506 --> 00:46:55.626 A:middle
scenarios as possible.

00:46:55.706 --> 00:46:57.606 A:middle
So, you want to take care in

00:46:57.606 --> 00:46:59.206 A:middle
selecting the right albedo value

00:46:59.726 --> 00:47:01.056 A:middle
that are neither too bright or
