[ Game Music ]

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:19.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:22.466 A:middle
So, there's no need of any kind

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:23.546 A:middle
of camera preview here.

00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:25.686 A:middle
There's no need for any 3D

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:26.216 A:middle
graphics.

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:28.396 A:middle
It's a lot more fun entirely in

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.736 A:middle
2D, but it's still a great AR

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:31.396 A:middle
experience.

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:34.976 A:middle
So, that was AR in 2D.

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:36.936 A:middle
But, another way, another thing

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.036 A:middle
you can do with ARKit is you can

00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:40.066 A:middle
build things that I would

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:41.596 A:middle
consider to be full virtual

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:42.946 A:middle
reality experiences.

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:45.146 A:middle
And, what I mean by that, is

00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:46.476 A:middle
that the experiences take you to

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:47.466 A:middle
a different place.

00:10:47.836 --> 00:10:49.106 A:middle
They really make you feel like

00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:50.166 A:middle
you're somewhere else.

00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:51.846 A:middle
You can walk around the

00:10:51.846 --> 00:10:52.556 A:middle
environment.

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.016 A:middle
You can move around within it.

00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:55.616 A:middle
You can look in all directions.

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:57.566 A:middle
And, to me that makes something

00:10:58.066 --> 00:10:59.706 A:middle
really into a virtual reality

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.266 A:middle
experience, even if it is
