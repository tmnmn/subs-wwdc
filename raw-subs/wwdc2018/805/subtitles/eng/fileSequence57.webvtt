00:57:00.956 --> 00:57:02.356 A:middle
In general, when working with AR

00:57:02.356 --> 00:57:04.256 A:middle
content, the use of a lot of

00:57:04.256 --> 00:57:05.216 A:middle
transparent surfaces can

00:57:05.216 --> 00:57:07.376 A:middle
potentially have a huge impact

00:57:07.376 --> 00:57:09.106 A:middle
on performance, especially if

00:57:09.106 --> 00:57:10.206 A:middle
you are having transparent

00:57:10.206 --> 00:57:11.036 A:middle
surfaces that are, kind of,

00:57:11.036 --> 00:57:12.526 A:middle
stacked in front of each other

00:57:12.606 --> 00:57:13.286 A:middle
when you're viewing them.

00:57:13.716 --> 00:57:14.726 A:middle
This is known as overdraw, and

00:57:14.726 --> 00:57:15.196 A:middle
it's something that you

00:57:15.196 --> 00:57:16.526 A:middle
definitely want to avoid when

00:57:16.526 --> 00:57:17.306 A:middle
you're working in AR.

00:57:18.716 --> 00:57:19.256 A:middle
Whew. Alright.

00:57:19.476 --> 00:57:20.826 A:middle
I hope everybody's still with

00:57:20.826 --> 00:57:21.996 A:middle
me, as that was quite a lot to

00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:22.486 A:middle
go through.

00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:24.646 A:middle
So far, we've focused mostly on

00:57:25.126 --> 00:57:27.156 A:middle
how the AR content will react to

00:57:27.266 --> 00:57:28.786 A:middle
the simulated spotlights found

00:57:28.786 --> 00:57:29.826 A:middle
in our 3D engines.

00:57:30.156 --> 00:57:31.276 A:middle
But now, it's time to focus on

00:57:31.276 --> 00:57:32.576 A:middle
some ways to make our content

00:57:32.576 --> 00:57:33.966 A:middle
seem like it's actually part of

00:57:33.966 --> 00:57:34.506 A:middle
the real world.

00:57:35.046 --> 00:57:37.696 A:middle
A fantastic option to use to

00:57:37.696 --> 00:57:38.846 A:middle
compensate for varied lighting

00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:40.226 A:middle
conditions is to leverage one of

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:44.636 A:middle
ARKit's well known features, and

00:57:44.636 --> 00:57:45.326 A:middle
light estimation.

00:57:45.996 --> 00:57:47.116 A:middle
Let's begin by activating this

00:57:47.116 --> 00:57:48.126 A:middle
functionality and see how it

00:57:48.126 --> 00:57:48.736 A:middle
affects our kettle.

00:57:49.156 --> 00:57:50.286 A:middle
Notice that how when the ambient

00:57:50.286 --> 00:57:51.406 A:middle
light changes in intensity in

00:57:51.406 --> 00:57:52.906 A:middle
the real world, a similar

00:57:52.906 --> 00:57:53.766 A:middle
adjustment is made to the

00:57:53.766 --> 00:57:55.316 A:middle
ambient light in our AR scene.

00:57:56.436 --> 00:57:57.676 A:middle
The way this works is that ARKit

00:57:57.676 --> 00:57:59.256 A:middle
analyzes each frame of the

00:57:59.256 --> 00:58:01.286 A:middle
video, and uses them to estimate
