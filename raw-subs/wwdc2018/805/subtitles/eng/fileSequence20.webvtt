00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
And, direct manipulation is when

00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:02.116 A:middle
you interact directly with

00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:03.606 A:middle
things on the screen, like

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:04.956 A:middle
they're physical objects.

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:07.396 A:middle
You're not using controls to

00:20:07.646 --> 00:20:09.386 A:middle
scroll or to pinch to zoom.

00:20:09.696 --> 00:20:11.036 A:middle
You're interacting directly with

00:20:11.036 --> 00:20:11.696 A:middle
the content.

00:20:12.136 --> 00:20:13.126 A:middle
It's like there's a physical

00:20:13.126 --> 00:20:14.826 A:middle
thing that you're manipulating.

00:20:15.346 --> 00:20:17.646 A:middle
And, that's even more important

00:20:17.646 --> 00:20:18.286 A:middle
in AR.

00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:20.486 A:middle
Because in AR, as I said before,

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:21.876 A:middle
things are really physical.

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:23.306 A:middle
Objects feel like they're real.

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:25.506 A:middle
They feel like part of the real

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:25.966 A:middle
world.

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.286 A:middle
So, it's really important to use

00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:29.866 A:middle
direct manipulation to make it

00:20:29.866 --> 00:20:30.926 A:middle
feel like you're interacting

00:20:30.926 --> 00:20:32.726 A:middle
directly with those objects.

00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:36.226 A:middle
And, direct manipulation is also

00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:38.496 A:middle
great because it uses gestures

00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:40.166 A:middle
that you already know, that you

00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:41.716 A:middle
have experience with from iOS.

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:44.226 A:middle
Because those gestures will be

00:20:44.226 --> 00:20:46.116 A:middle
the same as any other content on

00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:46.326 A:middle
iOS.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.456 A:middle
They're things that you've been

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.396 A:middle
using for probably a long time.

00:20:50.876 --> 00:20:53.836 A:middle
So, the first one there is how

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.036 A:middle
you can move objects in AR with

00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:57.056 A:middle
direct manipulation.

00:20:57.566 --> 00:20:59.246 A:middle
If you want to move objects, you

00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:00.256 A:middle
just put your finger down and
