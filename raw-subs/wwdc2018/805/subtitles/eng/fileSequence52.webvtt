00:51:58.006 --> 00:52:00.466 A:middle
to be reflective in the areas on

00:52:00.466 --> 00:52:01.446 A:middle
the map that were actually

00:52:01.446 --> 00:52:01.626 A:middle
white.

00:52:02.296 --> 00:52:03.316 A:middle
And, despite begin called

00:52:03.316 --> 00:52:04.326 A:middle
metalness, it doesn't

00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:05.336 A:middle
necessarily mean that your

00:52:05.336 --> 00:52:06.886 A:middle
object needs to contain metal.

00:52:07.556 --> 00:52:08.336 A:middle
Rather, we're just letting the

00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:10.296 A:middle
3D engine know that this object

00:52:10.296 --> 00:52:11.416 A:middle
should exhibit, kind of, a

00:52:11.416 --> 00:52:12.906 A:middle
reflective surface.

00:52:13.416 --> 00:52:16.016 A:middle
Now, it's best to use the

00:52:16.016 --> 00:52:17.176 A:middle
metalness map on your model,

00:52:17.526 --> 00:52:19.336 A:middle
like our kettle here, when it

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.266 A:middle
has both a mixture of metallic

00:52:21.266 --> 00:52:22.466 A:middle
and non-metallic surfaces.

00:52:23.066 --> 00:52:24.276 A:middle
It's a simple grayscale map,

00:52:24.726 --> 00:52:25.676 A:middle
where the level of metalness

00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:27.646 A:middle
ranges from being black, for

00:52:27.646 --> 00:52:29.006 A:middle
non-metal surfaces, to white,

00:52:29.006 --> 00:52:30.166 A:middle
for metallic surfaces.

00:52:31.016 --> 00:52:32.256 A:middle
And, it allows for a single

00:52:32.256 --> 00:52:34.836 A:middle
material to be used to represent

00:52:34.836 --> 00:52:35.906 A:middle
both reflective and

00:52:35.906 --> 00:52:37.466 A:middle
non-reflective surfaces on your

00:52:37.466 --> 00:52:38.126 A:middle
single object.

00:52:38.926 --> 00:52:41.216 A:middle
However, this kettle's a bit

00:52:41.276 --> 00:52:42.066 A:middle
crazy reflective.

00:52:42.336 --> 00:52:43.966 A:middle
And, doesn't really quite

00:52:44.016 --> 00:52:44.966 A:middle
provide the look that we're

00:52:44.966 --> 00:52:45.466 A:middle
hoping for.

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:47.636 A:middle
So, in this case, we want to

00:52:47.636 --> 00:52:49.146 A:middle
potentially vary the amount of

00:52:49.146 --> 00:52:50.456 A:middle
reflectivity, as well as

00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:51.906 A:middle
simulate the fact that all

00:52:51.906 --> 00:52:53.576 A:middle
surfaces are not perfectly

00:52:53.576 --> 00:52:54.006 A:middle
smooth.

00:52:54.296 --> 00:52:55.526 A:middle
And, they actually might exhibit

00:52:55.816 --> 00:52:58.056 A:middle
slight small, microabrasions to

00:52:58.056 --> 00:52:58.696 A:middle
their surface.

00:52:59.206 --> 00:53:01.466 A:middle
And, this is where the roughness
