00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
the content from different

00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:01.806 A:middle
positions, and from different

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:02.266 A:middle
angles.

00:25:02.836 --> 00:25:04.586 A:middle
So, it solves that same problem

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.196 A:middle
of wanting to see more, but it

00:25:06.196 --> 00:25:07.376 A:middle
solves it fully in three

00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:07.996 A:middle
dimensions.

00:25:09.396 --> 00:25:11.096 A:middle
Similarly, in a traditional 2D

00:25:11.096 --> 00:25:11.956 A:middle
app, if you want to see

00:25:11.956 --> 00:25:13.786 A:middle
something bigger, you pinch in

00:25:13.786 --> 00:25:14.696 A:middle
on it to make it bigger.

00:25:14.696 --> 00:25:15.676 A:middle
You pinch to zoom.

00:25:16.026 --> 00:25:17.806 A:middle
If you want to see it smaller,

00:25:18.136 --> 00:25:19.216 A:middle
you pinch out.

00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:21.126 A:middle
You pinch to zoom out.

00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:24.096 A:middle
But, in AR, if you want to see

00:25:24.096 --> 00:25:25.546 A:middle
something bigger, you can just

00:25:25.546 --> 00:25:26.666 A:middle
get closer to the thing you're

00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:27.106 A:middle
looking at.

00:25:27.106 --> 00:25:28.346 A:middle
You can just move closer in.

00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:30.116 A:middle
And, if you want to see more

00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:31.716 A:middle
things at once, you want to see

00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:34.046 A:middle
things from a wider angle, you

00:25:34.046 --> 00:25:35.976 A:middle
can just take a step back, and

00:25:35.976 --> 00:25:37.156 A:middle
look at all of the content at

00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:37.516 A:middle
once.

00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:41.426 A:middle
So, moving your device, it also

00:25:41.426 --> 00:25:42.906 A:middle
replaces what you might have

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:44.546 A:middle
done by pinch to zoom to see

00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:47.816 A:middle
more content in a 2D

00:25:47.816 --> 00:25:48.536 A:middle
application.

00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:52.116 A:middle
So, movement is really great.

00:25:52.116 --> 00:25:53.756 A:middle
It can replace some of those

00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:54.596 A:middle
things you might have used

00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:55.506 A:middle
multi-touch for.

00:25:56.056 --> 00:25:57.846 A:middle
You can also use it to build

00:25:57.846 --> 00:26:00.396 A:middle
totally custom interactions for
