00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.576 A:middle
built-in AR experiences help

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.716 A:middle
guide people into AR.

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:04.606 A:middle
And then, how you can take those

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:06.446 A:middle
principles, and apply them in

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.466 A:middle
your own apps.

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.206 A:middle
Next, we'll talk about the

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:11.546 A:middle
different ways you can present

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:12.596 A:middle
content in AR.

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:14.836 A:middle
The different possibilities that

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:17.106 A:middle
ARKit opens up, and also some

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:19.046 A:middle
tips and tricks that are great

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:20.306 A:middle
no matter what kind of AR app

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:20.896 A:middle
you're making.

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:23.866 A:middle
And finally, we'll talk about

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.286 A:middle
interactions in the world.

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:26.976 A:middle
It's a little bit different when

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:28.616 A:middle
you're building an AR app than

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:29.636 A:middle
when you're building a 2D app,

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:31.386 A:middle
for what kind of interactions

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:32.806 A:middle
make sense, and what kind of

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:33.746 A:middle
interactions you're going to

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.456 A:middle
want to use.

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:36.056 A:middle
So, we'll figure out what still

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:37.786 A:middle
works great in AR, and then,

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:38.896 A:middle
where we might need some new

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:40.036 A:middle
kinds of interactions.

00:03:41.436 --> 00:03:43.566 A:middle
But first, I want to get started

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:44.946 A:middle
with talking about how to get

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:45.706 A:middle
into AR.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:47.546 A:middle
And, what I'm talking about here

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.476 A:middle
is after somebody's downloaded

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:51.396 A:middle
your app, after they've found

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:52.576 A:middle
the AR experience in the app,

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:54.316 A:middle
they've opened it up, what I'm

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:57.376 A:middle
talking about here is when ARKit

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:58.936 A:middle
needs to understand the world.

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.936 A:middle
Because for every AR app, ARKit
