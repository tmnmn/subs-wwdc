00:58:58.846 --> 00:59:00.526 A:middle
intensity of that effect to make

00:59:00.526 --> 00:59:02.536 A:middle
sure that it actually feels a

00:59:02.536 --> 00:59:03.476 A:middle
little bit more subtle.

00:59:04.236 --> 00:59:05.136 A:middle
This will allow your shadows to

00:59:05.136 --> 00:59:06.216 A:middle
work in a lot more different

00:59:06.216 --> 00:59:08.016 A:middle
situations, and a lot more

00:59:08.016 --> 00:59:08.786 A:middle
different scenarios.

00:59:09.606 --> 00:59:10.926 A:middle
An alternative to this is

00:59:10.926 --> 00:59:12.076 A:middle
actually using a method where

00:59:12.076 --> 00:59:13.186 A:middle
you can create your own drop

00:59:13.186 --> 00:59:14.356 A:middle
shadow, rather than using

00:59:14.356 --> 00:59:15.576 A:middle
dynamic lights in your scene,

00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:17.556 A:middle
which can get expensive, and can

00:59:17.556 --> 00:59:19.446 A:middle
severely affect performance if

00:59:19.446 --> 00:59:20.516 A:middle
you're rendering a lot of 3D

00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:20.966 A:middle
content.

00:59:21.736 --> 00:59:23.956 A:middle
Take the time to craft those

00:59:24.296 --> 00:59:25.256 A:middle
really good shadows.

00:59:25.256 --> 00:59:26.746 A:middle
And ensure that they will fit in

00:59:26.746 --> 00:59:28.736 A:middle
as many real world situations as

00:59:28.796 --> 00:59:29.166 A:middle
possible.

00:59:29.746 --> 00:59:32.306 A:middle
Ah, environment maps.

00:59:33.086 --> 00:59:34.486 A:middle
If you really want to astound

00:59:34.486 --> 00:59:35.866 A:middle
people, you definitely want to

00:59:35.866 --> 00:59:37.326 A:middle
use these maps, especially on

00:59:37.326 --> 00:59:39.166 A:middle
those AR objects that exhibit

00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:39.886 A:middle
reflectivity.

00:59:40.796 --> 00:59:41.946 A:middle
It'll make it seem like your AR

00:59:41.946 --> 00:59:43.746 A:middle
content exists right here, in

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:44.366 A:middle
the real world.

00:59:44.836 --> 00:59:46.336 A:middle
And, to make it super easy to

00:59:46.336 --> 00:59:48.086 A:middle
leverage their powers we want to

00:59:48.086 --> 00:59:49.606 A:middle
show you how one of the new

00:59:49.606 --> 00:59:52.176 A:middle
features in iOS 12 and ARKit

00:59:52.176 --> 00:59:54.006 A:middle
2.0, automatic environmental

00:59:54.006 --> 00:59:55.586 A:middle
mapping, can help you achieve

00:59:55.586 --> 00:59:56.026 A:middle
this effect.

00:59:57.576 --> 00:59:58.826 A:middle
If you take a close look at the

00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.306 A:middle
kettle, originally we're using a
