Give them something to base that

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.296 A:middle
understanding off of.

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:03.416 A:middle
And, let's talk about that.

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:04.606 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:07.236 A:middle
So, this is the game Euclidean

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:07.756 A:middle
Lands.

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:09.546 A:middle
And, what it's showing here, is

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.356 A:middle
the device moving around inside

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:11.986 A:middle
of a room.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:13.936 A:middle
And, that's really great,

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:15.376 A:middle
because you can see here,

00:05:15.376 --> 00:05:18.026 A:middle
without any text exactly what it

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.866 A:middle
is you need to do, that you need

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.366 A:middle
to move the device within that

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:24.596 A:middle
room, and just turning the

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:25.666 A:middle
device to look at a different

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.496 A:middle
angle isn't going to be enough.

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:29.406 A:middle
So, without any text, it's

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:31.156 A:middle
really clear from that fixed

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.976 A:middle
reference of the room, exactly

00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:35.346 A:middle
what you need to do.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.426 A:middle
And, usually, most of the time,

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:38.606 A:middle
that is all you're going to

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:38.976 A:middle
need.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.396 A:middle
ARKit is even faster to build

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:42.746 A:middle
that understanding of the world

00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:44.096 A:middle
in iOS 12.

00:05:44.696 --> 00:05:47.136 A:middle
So, in even more cases that is

00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:48.316 A:middle
all you're going to need.

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:49.956 A:middle
You just need to start moving,

00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:51.036 A:middle
and you're ready to go.

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:54.056 A:middle
But, of course, there are some

00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.646 A:middle
situations that aren't quite as

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.636 A:middle
well suited to AR.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.836 A:middle
Maybe you're in a dark room, or

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:00.696 A:middle
it's really reflective, and it's
