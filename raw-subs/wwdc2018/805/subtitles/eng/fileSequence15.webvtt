00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:01.766 A:middle
But, you should still try and

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:03.376 A:middle
keep how much text it is that

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:04.946 A:middle
you're actually showing in AR to

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.606 A:middle
as little as possible.

00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:08.756 A:middle
And, the reasons for that is

00:15:08.756 --> 00:15:10.126 A:middle
when text is placed in the

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
world, you always have to keep

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:13.866 A:middle
pointing your device at it in

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:14.546 A:middle
order to read it.

00:15:15.156 --> 00:15:16.346 A:middle
If you turn your device to a

00:15:16.346 --> 00:15:17.776 A:middle
more natural reading position,

00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:19.536 A:middle
the text is going to go away.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.916 A:middle
So, if you have more detailed

00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.376 A:middle
text, if you're showing details

00:15:24.806 --> 00:15:26.126 A:middle
about some kind of object, or

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.756 A:middle
something in the world, you

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:29.446 A:middle
should show those details on the

00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:30.126 A:middle
display.

00:15:30.206 --> 00:15:31.746 A:middle
And then, people can use all

00:15:31.746 --> 00:15:33.456 A:middle
that experience that they built

00:15:33.456 --> 00:15:35.996 A:middle
up using iOS and reading things

00:15:35.996 --> 00:15:38.636 A:middle
on their devices, to read those

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.546 A:middle
details directly on the display.

00:15:41.926 --> 00:15:43.166 A:middle
And, when you're showing those

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.276 A:middle
details, when you're coming out

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.146 A:middle
of AR, it's important to have a

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:46.896 A:middle
transition.

00:15:47.596 --> 00:15:48.916 A:middle
Because those transitions can

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:51.016 A:middle
make it really clear what it is

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:51.706 A:middle
you're looking at.

00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:55.066 A:middle
What text, what object it is

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.786 A:middle
that those details are

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:57.456 A:middle
referencing.

00:15:57.786 --> 00:15:58.886 A:middle
What it is that you're getting

00:15:58.886 --> 00:15:59.706 A:middle
details about.

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:02.526 A:middle
So, let's look at an example
