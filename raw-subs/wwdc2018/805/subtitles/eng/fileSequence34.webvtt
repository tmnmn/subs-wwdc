00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.536 A:middle
throughout the lands.

00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:03.876 A:middle
Remember, only you can prevent

00:34:04.026 --> 00:34:05.166 A:middle
excessive battery drain.

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:08.876 A:middle
I like to look at AR as having

00:34:08.876 --> 00:34:10.216 A:middle
the power to take anything you

00:34:10.216 --> 00:34:12.085 A:middle
can imagine and to transport

00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:12.826 A:middle
into the real world.

00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:14.866 A:middle
People want to explore your

00:34:14.866 --> 00:34:16.826 A:middle
content, so you definitely want

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:17.606 A:middle
to bring your A game.

00:34:18.326 --> 00:34:19.755 A:middle
Take the time to craft those

00:34:19.755 --> 00:34:21.286 A:middle
nuanced details into your 3D

00:34:21.286 --> 00:34:21.786 A:middle
content.

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:23.786 A:middle
Build a cohesive story and

00:34:23.786 --> 00:34:24.315 A:middle
style.

00:34:24.356 --> 00:34:25.866 A:middle
And, remember that every little

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:27.456 A:middle
detail, every little touch is an

00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:29.315 A:middle
opportunity to surprise people.

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:32.606 A:middle
So, let's say we wanted to make

00:34:32.606 --> 00:34:34.485 A:middle
an AR experience to be about an

00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:34.996 A:middle
aquarium.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:37.536 A:middle
Even in its most abstract form,

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:38.606 A:middle
I think I would be really

00:34:38.606 --> 00:34:39.755 A:middle
hard-pressed to find anybody who

00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:40.806 A:middle
would believe that this

00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:42.176 A:middle
marshmallow blob represents a

00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:42.585 A:middle
fish.

00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:45.306 A:middle
On a positive note, though, our

00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:46.406 A:middle
app will pretty much rock the

00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:47.815 A:middle
performance numbers if this

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:49.056 A:middle
little guy's flopping around.

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:51.505 A:middle
So, let's try that again.

00:34:52.806 --> 00:34:54.636 A:middle
Ah, now this is much better.

00:34:55.356 --> 00:34:56.496 A:middle
That is one properly

00:34:56.496 --> 00:34:57.386 A:middle
dead-looking fish.

00:34:58.166 --> 00:34:59.856 A:middle
See how it exhibits some nice

00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:01.416 A:middle
details, that once it's running
