00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:01.416 A:middle
details, that once it's running

00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:03.766 A:middle
in AR will really want to entice

00:35:03.766 --> 00:35:05.036 A:middle
people to move closer to it to

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:07.126 A:middle
see all those nuanced details

00:35:07.126 --> 00:35:08.726 A:middle
and explore its features.

00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:10.906 A:middle
We should strive to maintain

00:35:10.906 --> 00:35:12.386 A:middle
this level of quality with all

00:35:12.386 --> 00:35:13.446 A:middle
the fishes swimming in our

00:35:13.446 --> 00:35:15.426 A:middle
aquarium, or just floating in

00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:17.046 A:middle
the top in this case.

00:35:17.836 --> 00:35:19.276 A:middle
Finally, it's important to

00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:20.516 A:middle
remember that people really want

00:35:20.516 --> 00:35:21.646 A:middle
to use your app in a wide

00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:22.596 A:middle
variety of environments.

00:35:23.006 --> 00:35:24.406 A:middle
You want to avoid having your

00:35:24.406 --> 00:35:27.136 A:middle
content stand out in real world

00:35:27.136 --> 00:35:29.136 A:middle
locations where potentially the

00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:30.516 A:middle
lighting ambient conditions

00:35:30.516 --> 00:35:31.816 A:middle
could conflict with the story

00:35:31.816 --> 00:35:32.626 A:middle
that you're trying to tell.

00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:34.856 A:middle
So, when working with your

00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:36.416 A:middle
assets, try to avoid using

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:38.146 A:middle
colors that are either too

00:35:38.146 --> 00:35:39.266 A:middle
bright or too dark.

00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:40.846 A:middle
And, make sure that you light

00:35:40.846 --> 00:35:42.206 A:middle
your AR scene in a way that it

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.026 A:middle
casts even lighting on all the

00:35:44.026 --> 00:35:45.416 A:middle
objects that you're planning to

00:35:45.836 --> 00:35:46.966 A:middle
render, and at no matter what

00:35:46.966 --> 00:35:48.046 A:middle
angle you view them from.

00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:50.546 A:middle
You want your AR content to work

00:35:50.546 --> 00:35:51.926 A:middle
whether it's day or night.

00:35:52.486 --> 00:35:54.116 A:middle
Now, spoiler alert, we're going

00:35:54.116 --> 00:35:55.406 A:middle
to go over some really nice

00:35:55.406 --> 00:35:57.256 A:middle
features in ARKit that will

00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:58.916 A:middle
enable you to really delight

00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.476 A:middle
people when they see your AR
