00:50:00.046 --> 00:50:01.896 A:middle
If you take a look at this

00:50:01.896 --> 00:50:03.246 A:middle
example, you can see a simple

00:50:03.246 --> 00:50:04.866 A:middle
sphere, being rendered with flat

00:50:04.866 --> 00:50:05.236 A:middle
shading.

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:06.836 A:middle
What this means, that the

00:50:06.836 --> 00:50:08.196 A:middle
normals associated with each

00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:09.776 A:middle
face of the mesh are pointing in

00:50:09.776 --> 00:50:11.556 A:middle
the exact same direction, as

00:50:11.556 --> 00:50:12.686 A:middle
seen by the 2D diagram.

00:50:13.586 --> 00:50:15.376 A:middle
Now, when you -- when light

00:50:15.376 --> 00:50:16.676 A:middle
reacts to this surface, you'll

00:50:16.676 --> 00:50:18.366 A:middle
be actually able to notice all

00:50:18.366 --> 00:50:19.936 A:middle
the different polygons

00:50:19.936 --> 00:50:21.246 A:middle
comprising this mesh due to

00:50:21.246 --> 00:50:22.856 A:middle
being evenly lit across each

00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:23.286 A:middle
face.

00:50:23.776 --> 00:50:25.866 A:middle
Here, though, we're using the

00:50:25.866 --> 00:50:27.496 A:middle
exact same model, but leveraging

00:50:27.496 --> 00:50:28.866 A:middle
a technique called smooth or

00:50:28.866 --> 00:50:29.716 A:middle
phong shading.

00:50:30.346 --> 00:50:31.756 A:middle
Notice that the normals are

00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:33.186 A:middle
actually gradually changing as

00:50:33.186 --> 00:50:34.356 A:middle
you move across the surface of

00:50:34.356 --> 00:50:34.996 A:middle
the polygon.

00:50:35.786 --> 00:50:37.736 A:middle
With the engine calculates the

00:50:37.766 --> 00:50:40.076 A:middle
reflection off of this model,

00:50:40.076 --> 00:50:41.096 A:middle
it'll give the impression of a

00:50:41.096 --> 00:50:43.016 A:middle
smooth, curved surface due to

00:50:43.016 --> 00:50:44.636 A:middle
the gradual interpolation of

00:50:44.636 --> 00:50:45.296 A:middle
these normals.

00:50:46.726 --> 00:50:48.206 A:middle
What's really awesome is that

00:50:48.206 --> 00:50:49.486 A:middle
these two models have the exact

00:50:49.486 --> 00:50:50.366 A:middle
same number of polygons

00:50:50.366 --> 00:50:51.146 A:middle
associated with them.

00:50:51.336 --> 00:50:52.186 A:middle
But, through this normal

00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:54.016 A:middle
manipulation, the object will

00:50:54.016 --> 00:50:54.946 A:middle
seem to have a much more

00:50:54.946 --> 00:50:56.626 A:middle
smoother and detailed surface,

00:50:56.976 --> 00:50:58.466 A:middle
without the need to, again, add

00:50:58.466 --> 00:50:59.756 A:middle
or change any of the geometry

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.036 A:middle
associated with this mesh.
