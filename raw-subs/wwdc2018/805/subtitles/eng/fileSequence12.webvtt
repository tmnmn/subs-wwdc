00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:00.716 A:middle
powerful experience.

00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:03.496 A:middle
And, that's what you can do with

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:05.326 A:middle
virtual reality using ARKit.

00:12:05.836 --> 00:12:08.356 A:middle
So, those are some of the more

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:10.186 A:middle
radical options of things that

00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:11.396 A:middle
you can build with ARKit.

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:13.986 A:middle
We can also look at some tips

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.206 A:middle
and tricks that make sense no

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:17.266 A:middle
matter what kind of app it is

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:17.936 A:middle
that you're building.

00:12:18.356 --> 00:12:19.686 A:middle
Whether it's a game, or a

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:21.736 A:middle
productivity app, these can work

00:12:21.736 --> 00:12:22.346 A:middle
for everything.

00:12:22.926 --> 00:12:25.286 A:middle
So, the first thing I want to

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.256 A:middle
talk about here is showing text

00:12:28.256 --> 00:12:28.656 A:middle
in AR.

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.546 A:middle
Because text is really

00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:32.056 A:middle
important.

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:34.816 A:middle
All kinds of AR apps have

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.776 A:middle
different reasons to show text.

00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:38.316 A:middle
If it's a game, maybe you want

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:40.046 A:middle
to show the title of a level, or

00:12:40.046 --> 00:12:41.066 A:middle
some instructions.

00:12:41.586 --> 00:12:42.956 A:middle
Or, maybe for other kinds of

00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:44.046 A:middle
apps, you want to label

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:45.896 A:middle
something in the world, label a

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:46.866 A:middle
virtual object.

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:48.696 A:middle
Maybe show some annotations.

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:51.136 A:middle
But, the important part, no

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:52.406 A:middle
matter what reason it is that

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:54.116 A:middle
you're showing this text, is to

00:12:54.116 --> 00:12:55.546 A:middle
keep that text readable.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.836 A:middle
Make it really easy to read.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.706 A:middle
So, the simplest way to show
