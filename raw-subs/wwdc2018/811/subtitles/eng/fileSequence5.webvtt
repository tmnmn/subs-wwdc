00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:03.006 A:middle
Don't respond like that.

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.826 A:middle
And don't be dismissive or get

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
overly defensive.

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.916 A:middle
It really won't help your case.

00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:12.586 A:middle
Seek advice.

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:16.846 A:middle
Use the wisdom of your

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:17.306 A:middle
colleagues.

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:20.016 A:middle
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.236 A:middle
They know how this works.

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:23.946 A:middle
Their input is priceless.

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:25.786 A:middle
Practice with them.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.596 A:middle
Sense check your deck.

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.026 A:middle
Do a full practice run if it

00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:30.606 A:middle
merits it.

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.616 A:middle
Do not deliver it blind.

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:34.836 A:middle
The feedback will make a huge

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:35.416 A:middle
difference.

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
And honestly, don't try to do

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.756 A:middle
everything yourself.

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.546 A:middle
Teamwork makes the dream work

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:47.536 A:middle
plus it's really hard to keep

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:48.836 A:middle
track of too many disparate

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:51.076 A:middle
things as one person, let alone

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:53.336 A:middle
try and explain them to others

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:54.856 A:middle
in a single presentation.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.786 A:middle
Use your own voice.

00:05:58.456 --> 00:05:59.366 A:middle
Be genuine.
