00:12:00.076 --> 00:12:03.616 A:middle
And the truth is that people

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:04.926 A:middle
really won't remember your

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:05.616 A:middle
slides.

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:07.566 A:middle
They'll remember how your story

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:09.906 A:middle
made them feel if it resonated

00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:13.676 A:middle
with them so sketch out the

00:12:13.676 --> 00:12:15.436 A:middle
narrative of your presentation

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:16.206 A:middle
early.

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:18.636 A:middle
The most successful designers I

00:12:18.636 --> 00:12:19.386 A:middle
know do this.

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:21.126 A:middle
It's another thing that will

00:12:21.126 --> 00:12:23.206 A:middle
help you focus and use your time

00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:24.116 A:middle
effectively.

00:12:25.306 --> 00:12:27.196 A:middle
So where you can, incorporate a

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:29.746 A:middle
story with a distinct beginning,

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:31.546 A:middle
middle, and an end.

00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:35.266 A:middle
People intuitively get stories.

00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:37.446 A:middle
And it'll really help them

00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:38.426 A:middle
follow along.

00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:42.636 A:middle
Contrast today's reality with a

00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:43.416 A:middle
better future.

Nancy Duarte, a master of

00:12:47.446 --> 00:12:49.606 A:middle
presentations, discovered in her

00:12:49.606 --> 00:12:51.006 A:middle
research that some of the

00:12:51.006 --> 00:12:52.726 A:middle
greatest and most effective

00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:54.286 A:middle
presentations follow this

00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:54.666 A:middle
structure.

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:57.466 A:middle
And the key thing here is

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.076 A:middle
providing the contrast between

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:02.526 A:middle
what is today's reality and what
