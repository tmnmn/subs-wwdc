00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
feedback.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:05.116 A:middle
Take all of it seriously even

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:05.936 A:middle
when you disagree.

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:08.826 A:middle
If you are presenting, you are

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:09.626 A:middle
asking for feedback.

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:15.086 A:middle
It's the whole point and clarify

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.406 A:middle
the problems the audience

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:17.125 A:middle
identify.

00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:19.886 A:middle
Sometimes people offer solutions

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:21.946 A:middle
that are unworkable, but the

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:23.356 A:middle
problem they are addressing is

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.226 A:middle
totally valid.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:27.656 A:middle
So when you have exhausted all

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:31.156 A:middle
possibilities, remember this,

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:32.936 A:middle
you really haven't.

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:36.556 A:middle
People in your audience will

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.156 A:middle
know things you don't.

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:40.356 A:middle
So be willing to change your

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:42.366 A:middle
position, especially when new

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.000 A:middle
information has been presented.

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:50.286 A:middle
Don't pretend to understand

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:51.406 A:middle
unclear feedback.

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:57.446 A:middle
Clarify the problem this person

00:04:57.446 --> 00:04:58.666 A:middle
is trying to address.

00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:03.006 A:middle
Don't respond like that.
