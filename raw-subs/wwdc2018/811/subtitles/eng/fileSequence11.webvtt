00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Think of it as a discussion more

00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:02.216 A:middle
than a speech.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.956 A:middle
And finally, the idea.

00:11:06.536 --> 00:11:09.736 A:middle
It is crucial to explain why.

00:11:10.906 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
Define each problem in a single

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:13.656 A:middle
sentence.

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.496 A:middle
It's a great exercise to really

00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:16.976 A:middle
get to the heart of the matter.

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:20.786 A:middle
You'll need to find agreement on

00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:21.956 A:middle
those problem statements with

00:11:21.956 --> 00:11:22.816 A:middle
your audience.

00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:24.856 A:middle
Otherwise, you'll be barking up

00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:25.886 A:middle
the wrong tree.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:29.626 A:middle
Continue to revisit, refine, and

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:30.996 A:middle
refer back to those statements

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:34.266 A:middle
as you progress and, of course,

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:36.416 A:middle
where you can, show evidence

00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:37.726 A:middle
that these problems exist.

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:39.496 A:middle
Boom.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.916 A:middle
Cold, burnt toast.

00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:44.166 A:middle
Tragic problems in this world.

00:11:46.176 --> 00:11:49.366 A:middle
Avoid using subjective reasoning

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:50.996 A:middle
for your decisions.

00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:53.186 A:middle
I chose this color because I

00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:55.176 A:middle
like it is not remotely

00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:57.796 A:middle
persuasive, especially if your

00:11:57.796 --> 00:11:58.826 A:middle
audience don't share your

00:11:58.826 --> 00:11:59.566 A:middle
preferences.
