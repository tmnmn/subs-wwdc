00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:01.386 A:middle
toward design.

00:14:02.756 --> 00:14:04.436 A:middle
Don't overload people with too

00:14:04.436 --> 00:14:05.526 A:middle
much information.

00:14:06.156 --> 00:14:08.166 A:middle
Strip away everything that isn't

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.886 A:middle
essential to your mission or

00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:10.586 A:middle
your message.

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:14.116 A:middle

00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:14.956 A:middle
summarize.

00:14:16.766 --> 00:14:19.236 A:middle

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:20.416 A:middle
what's the point?

Embrace feedback.

00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:23.696 A:middle
It's what you're here for.

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:26.246 A:middle
Seek advice.

00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:28.206 A:middle
Your colleagues are smart.

00:14:28.716 --> 00:14:30.496 A:middle
And use your own voice.

00:14:30.806 --> 00:14:33.486 A:middle
It's the best one you have.

00:14:33.546 --> 00:14:35.376 A:middle
Respect your audience or they

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:36.706 A:middle
won't respect you.

00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:39.416 A:middle
Make it relatable, otherwise

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:40.336 A:middle
they'll forget it.

00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:44.496 A:middle
Engage in dialogue to keep them

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:47.566 A:middle
present and explain why.

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:48.926 A:middle
It's the million dollar

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:49.446 A:middle
question.

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:52.786 A:middle
Utilize storytelling because it

00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:53.506 A:middle
works.

00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:56.226 A:middle
And keep it simple even though

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:56.646 A:middle
it's not.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.196 A:middle
Good luck with your

00:14:58.196 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
