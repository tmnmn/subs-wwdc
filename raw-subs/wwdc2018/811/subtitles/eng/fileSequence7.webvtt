00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:02.346 A:middle
It's not a presentation without

00:07:02.346 --> 00:07:03.086 A:middle
an audience.

00:07:03.896 --> 00:07:05.636 A:middle
Make sure you show them that

00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:06.226 A:middle
respect.

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:08.686 A:middle
You need their cooperation to

00:07:08.686 --> 00:07:10.076 A:middle
give life to your ideas.

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:12.056 A:middle
And if you've presented to this

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:14.716 A:middle
audience before, you'll get --

00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:16.396 A:middle
start to get an idea of what

00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:17.176 A:middle
they respond to.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.726 A:middle
Tailor to them as much as you

00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:22.666 A:middle
can and always have an agenda.

00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:24.186 A:middle
Here's what we're going to talk

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:25.686 A:middle
about in this order.

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.276 A:middle
This is also your chance to

00:07:28.276 --> 00:07:30.226 A:middle
assert the point at which you'd

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:31.576 A:middle
like to field feedback.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.156 A:middle
It almost certainly won't work

00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:36.286 A:middle
that way but still do try.

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.076 A:middle
And if you've met previously,

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:41.566 A:middle
recap what happened.

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:43.636 A:middle
Like when you're engrossed in a

00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:45.706 A:middle
series but then life happens and

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:47.226 A:middle
when you pick it up again, you

00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:48.636 A:middle
really grateful for that 30

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:49.796 A:middle
second refresher.

00:07:51.686 --> 00:07:52.716 A:middle
Hey, Zach.

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.656 A:middle
Here's a study of the character

00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:56.666 A:middle
that you asked for.

00:07:58.716 --> 00:07:59.696 A:middle
Good feedback.

00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.876 A:middle
I'm not sure about those emoji
