&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

Hello everyone.

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:27.236 A:middle
Design is hard but design

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.516 A:middle
presentations are way harder.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.556 A:middle
I still find them daunting.

00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:37.476 A:middle
And today, a presentation about

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.376 A:middle
how to present design work at

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:40.296 A:middle
WWDC.

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.046 A:middle
The struggle is real.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.286 A:middle
In any presentation, we have to

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:50.326 A:middle
take this big and complex topic

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:52.506 A:middle
and explain it precisely.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.876 A:middle
Take it right down to its

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:55.706 A:middle
nucleus.

00:00:56.436 --> 00:00:57.976 A:middle
And if we don't do that well,

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.776 A:middle
those ideas might die.
