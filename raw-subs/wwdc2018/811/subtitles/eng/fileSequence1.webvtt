00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.776 A:middle
those ideas might die.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:03.596 A:middle
All that hard work you did

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.686 A:middle
resigned to the depths of your

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:06.000 A:middle
hard drive.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:08.636 A:middle
Presentation matters.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.146 A:middle
As a designer at Apple, I have

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.616 A:middle
to present design work all the

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:14.006 A:middle
time.

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:17.626 A:middle
Unfortunately, this year I can't

00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:19.546 A:middle
show you too much of that, but

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.186 A:middle
I'm going to try and transmit to

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:23.266 A:middle
you the ten most important

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.826 A:middle
things I've learned about

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.386 A:middle
presenting design work in the

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.786 A:middle
next nine minutes or so.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.656 A:middle
It's going to be punchy.

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.506 A:middle
Now when you really think about

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:35.726 A:middle
it, there are three fundamental

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:37.346 A:middle
parts to a presentation.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:41.086 A:middle
There is me, the presenter, the

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:44.356 A:middle
emotional designer consumed by

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:45.966 A:middle
this problem and the prettiness

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:47.976 A:middle
of it.

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:50.136 A:middle
And there is you, the audience,

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:53.146 A:middle
detectives of design crime,

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:55.956 A:middle
guardians of good sense,

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:58.676 A:middle
Draculas of deadlines, and

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:00.256 A:middle
captains of code.
