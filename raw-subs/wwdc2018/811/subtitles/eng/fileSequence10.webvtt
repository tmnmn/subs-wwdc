00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.186 A:middle
breakfast.

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.576 A:middle
I hit the notification and bam,

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:05.446 A:middle
straightaway I can load my toast

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:06.986 A:middle
without even stepping away from

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:07.456 A:middle
my desk.

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:10.296 A:middle
Just one swipe down and we're

00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:10.836 A:middle
toasting.

00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:13.626 A:middle
And a few minutes later I know

00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:16.056 A:middle
to be on my way, perfect timing.

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:18.346 A:middle
And how cool is that?

00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.716 A:middle
I can even see my stats.

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:23.796 A:middle
Clearly, this is more powerful

00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:25.646 A:middle
if you can demo a prototype.

00:10:27.236 --> 00:10:29.206 A:middle
And engage in dialogue.

00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:31.346 A:middle
A presentation should be a

00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:31.876 A:middle
dialogue.

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:33.886 A:middle
Engage with your audience.

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:36.996 A:middle
Design for the aha moment.

00:10:37.726 --> 00:10:39.036 A:middle
If you can lead people through

00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:41.176 A:middle
your story, their minds will try

00:10:41.176 --> 00:10:42.346 A:middle
and predict the ending.

00:10:43.016 --> 00:10:44.076 A:middle
This will keep them engaged.

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:46.446 A:middle
Ask them questions.

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.176 A:middle
Keep them dialed in.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:49.746 A:middle
You're here for their feedback

00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
after all.

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:55.086 A:middle
Do not deliver a monologue.

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:58.806 A:middle
This is boring and naive.

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Think of it as a discussion more
