00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:00.256 A:middle
captains of code.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.306 A:middle
And between us, there is this

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.376 A:middle
central idea.

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.006 A:middle
The thing we need to agree is

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.286 A:middle
good for our company, good for

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:11.266 A:middle
our customers, something that

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.846 A:middle
makes the world a slightly

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:13.776 A:middle
better place.

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:15.766 A:middle
Let's call it a toaster.

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.976 A:middle
And really a presentation is

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:22.046 A:middle
just a mechanism to exchange

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.836 A:middle
information about that idea, to

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:27.126 A:middle
facilitate decisions and action

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.836 A:middle
one way or another, to make this

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:33.906 A:middle
thing fly or crash right back

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.106 A:middle
down to Earth.

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:39.166 A:middle
So dear presenter, these are the

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.886 A:middle
key things you need to

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:41.546 A:middle
understand.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.396 A:middle
What are your objectives for

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.306 A:middle
this presentation?

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.756 A:middle
Clarify your objectives.

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.546 A:middle
Are you trying to get this work

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:55.556 A:middle
approved by your superiors or

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:57.136 A:middle
successfully communicate with

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:57.766 A:middle
engineers?

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
Maybe you're pitching a new
