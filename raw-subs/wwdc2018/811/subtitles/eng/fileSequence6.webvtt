00:06:00.596 --> 00:06:01.686 A:middle
Have fun.

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:03.476 A:middle
Make terrible jokes.

00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:06.926 A:middle
Quote Bruce Lee.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.056 A:middle
You wouldn't be giving this

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:09.626 A:middle
presentation at all if you

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:10.816 A:middle
didn't have the credibility.

00:06:10.946 --> 00:06:13.626 A:middle
You've earned it.

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:14.986 A:middle
Express your opinion.

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:16.686 A:middle
You are the expert here.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.536 A:middle
The audience wants to know what

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:20.386 A:middle
you think and that doesn't mean

00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
you have to have all the

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:21.696 A:middle
answers.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.366 A:middle
Show your passion.

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.496 A:middle
Why do you care about this?

00:06:28.306 --> 00:06:29.796 A:middle
And explain your process.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:31.436 A:middle
Show the journey you've been on.

00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
How and why did you reach these

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:35.116 A:middle
conclusions?

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:40.456 A:middle
Don't be overconfident or

00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:41.476 A:middle
insincere.

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:43.956 A:middle
Sometimes designers can adopt a

00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:45.386 A:middle
posture of being super

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:47.426 A:middle
confident, bordering on arrogant

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:48.796 A:middle
and avoid that.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:50.056 A:middle
It's just not cool.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:52.706 A:middle
And don't say what you think

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:53.986 A:middle
people want to hear.

00:06:54.856 --> 00:06:56.576 A:middle
Your vote counts for a lot.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.726 A:middle
The audience.
