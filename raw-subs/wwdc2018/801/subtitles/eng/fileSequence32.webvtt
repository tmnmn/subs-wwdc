00:31:57.986 --> 00:32:00.006 A:middle
to describe quality during our

00:32:00.006 --> 00:32:01.686 A:middle
interview, and I think that's

00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:02.476 A:middle
really great.

00:32:03.256 --> 00:32:04.996 A:middle
If we all aspire to create

00:32:04.996 --> 00:32:06.246 A:middle
designs that are just a little

00:32:06.246 --> 00:32:08.556 A:middle
bit longer lasting, it not only

00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:10.036 A:middle
would save us time and effort

00:32:10.036 --> 00:32:12.596 A:middle
now, but it would put us into

00:32:12.596 --> 00:32:14.536 A:middle
the right mindset to provide

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:15.806 A:middle
something that we create with

00:32:15.806 --> 00:32:20.916 A:middle
the opportunity to be timeless.

00:32:21.036 --> 00:32:23.466 A:middle
This final aspiration really had

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:25.536 A:middle
an impact on me, and it came

00:32:25.536 --> 00:32:27.166 A:middle
from my colleague Doug when I

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:29.376 A:middle
asked him, "What makes great app

00:32:29.506 --> 00:32:29.976 A:middle
experiences?"

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:34.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When I think of, like, great

00:32:34.246 --> 00:32:36.366 A:middle
app experiences and things that

00:32:36.446 --> 00:32:38.466 A:middle
kind of provide something unique

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:40.676 A:middle
and valuable to users, I think a

00:32:40.676 --> 00:32:43.556 A:middle
lot of it is the substantial

00:32:43.556 --> 00:32:45.496 A:middle
kind of positive effect that it

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:47.546 A:middle
has on the user's life.

00:32:48.996 --> 00:32:51.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Doug, you nailed it.

00:32:51.526 --> 00:32:53.486 A:middle
Yes, absolutely, apps should

00:32:53.486 --> 00:32:54.956 A:middle
provide something unique and

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:57.366 A:middle
valuable, but, actually, it was

00:32:57.366 --> 00:32:58.946 A:middle
this part, the positive effect,

00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:00.796 A:middle
that really resonated with me.
