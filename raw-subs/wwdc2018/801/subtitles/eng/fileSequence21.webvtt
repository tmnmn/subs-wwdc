00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
because I am definitely not

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.986 A:middle
suggesting that you add a label

00:21:02.986 --> 00:21:04.996 A:middle
to your apps because you

00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:06.266 A:middle
[laughs] definitely don't need

00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:07.426 A:middle
to.

00:21:07.986 --> 00:21:10.046 A:middle
Every facet of your app

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.496 A:middle
experience, from the screenshots

00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:14.006 A:middle
on the App Store to the

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.596 A:middle
description, to how you respond

00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:19.196 A:middle
to customer reviews, all through

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:21.716 A:middle
to your app's interface, these

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:23.396 A:middle
experiences, these interactions

00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:25.296 A:middle
that you have with people, that

00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:27.566 A:middle
communicates the quality about

00:21:27.566 --> 00:21:28.996 A:middle
your app or your game.

00:21:29.936 --> 00:21:31.556 A:middle
And you don't want a label

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.166 A:middle
anyway.

00:21:32.946 --> 00:21:33.316 A:middle
Why?

00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:37.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; In a way, it's like saying

00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:38.226 A:middle
you're cool.

00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:41.476 A:middle
Like, being cool doesn't involve

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:42.786 A:middle
saying you're cool.

00:21:43.326 --> 00:21:46.396 A:middle
[laughs] And, you know, you only

00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:48.096 A:middle
say that someone else is cool.

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:49.986 A:middle
It's only something which can be

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:51.626 A:middle
sort of determined by an outside

00:21:51.626 --> 00:21:52.486 A:middle
party, in a way.

00:21:53.656 --> 00:21:56.146 A:middle
And even then, there's a certain

00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:57.196 A:middle
context where it feels more

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.316 A:middle
appropriate than others.

00:21:58.316 --> 00:21:59.396 A:middle
Like, if we're talking about

00:21:59.816 --> 00:22:01.976 A:middle
Thelonious Monk and we're just
