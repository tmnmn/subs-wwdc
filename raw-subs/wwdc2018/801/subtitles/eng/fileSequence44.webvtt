00:43:59.476 --> 00:44:01.626 A:middle
platform patterns, "How do you

00:44:01.626 --> 00:44:03.506 A:middle
approach designing for so many

00:44:03.556 --> 00:44:03.866 A:middle
people?"

00:44:03.866 --> 00:44:06.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Knowing what you don't know,

00:44:08.296 --> 00:44:08.696 A:middle
in a way.

00:44:08.976 --> 00:44:12.286 A:middle
What I mean is that if you're

00:44:12.286 --> 00:44:13.266 A:middle
looking at these things or if

00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:14.346 A:middle
you're designing for these

00:44:14.346 --> 00:44:15.396 A:middle
things, obviously, you have

00:44:16.306 --> 00:44:19.046 A:middle
ideas and ways of using a

00:44:19.046 --> 00:44:20.516 A:middle
certain device or an app in your

00:44:20.516 --> 00:44:21.396 A:middle
own way, in your own

00:44:21.396 --> 00:44:22.826 A:middle
environment, in your own habits,

00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:24.856 A:middle
and you might know a little bit

00:44:24.856 --> 00:44:26.266 A:middle
about how your friends are using

00:44:26.336 --> 00:44:27.956 A:middle
it, or how you've seen other

00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:29.296 A:middle
people use it, or maybe feedback

00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:30.996 A:middle
you're getting, but it's a

00:44:30.996 --> 00:44:32.426 A:middle
really big world, and there's a

00:44:32.426 --> 00:44:34.516 A:middle
lot of people out there, and

00:44:34.946 --> 00:44:35.876 A:middle
they all have their own needs,

00:44:35.936 --> 00:44:38.076 A:middle
their own habits, their own way

00:44:38.076 --> 00:44:39.356 A:middle
of going through life.

00:44:39.356 --> 00:44:40.546 A:middle
And so you have to be very

00:44:40.546 --> 00:44:42.766 A:middle
mindful that how you think about

00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:43.926 A:middle
things or your opinions are not

00:44:43.926 --> 00:44:45.506 A:middle
always, first of all, correct

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:48.896 A:middle
ones, nor the only ones.

00:44:49.696 --> 00:44:50.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I really like how Cas put

00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:53.146 A:middle
this at the beginning -- know

00:44:53.196 --> 00:44:54.146 A:middle
that you don't know.

00:44:54.986 --> 00:44:56.286 A:middle
And he also used this word

00:44:56.286 --> 00:44:57.326 A:middle
"modesty" through our

00:44:57.326 --> 00:44:58.176 A:middle
conversation.

00:44:58.686 --> 00:45:00.156 A:middle
To be unassuming when you're
