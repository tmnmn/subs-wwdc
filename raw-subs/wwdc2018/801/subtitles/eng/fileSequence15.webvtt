00:14:57.306 --> 00:15:00.706 A:middle
And that's just one answer to

00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:02.766 A:middle
the question, what is quality?

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:05.386 A:middle
And because there are so many

00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:06.526 A:middle
different interpretations of

00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:09.596 A:middle
quality, well, that means it's

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:11.396 A:middle
just really hard to achieve.

00:15:12.336 --> 00:15:13.466 A:middle
A little bit later, we're going

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:15.186 A:middle
to get into some techniques to

00:15:15.186 --> 00:15:16.726 A:middle
hopefully help make the process

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:17.626 A:middle
of designing a little bit

00:15:17.656 --> 00:15:18.206 A:middle
easier.

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:20.396 A:middle
But for now, let's just recap

00:15:20.536 --> 00:15:21.196 A:middle
what we've learned.

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:24.966 A:middle
So far, just by asking a few

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:27.056 A:middle
simple questions, we've learned

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:29.536 A:middle
that quality means something

00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:30.766 A:middle
different to different people,

00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:34.896 A:middle
that it's not random -- it is

00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:36.486 A:middle
crafted and considered.

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:40.196 A:middle
Quality is the result of time,

00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:41.546 A:middle
effort, and care.

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:45.836 A:middle
And it is just hard to achieve,

00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:48.916 A:middle
but that's okay.

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:50.556 A:middle
Quality has many different

00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:51.476 A:middle
interpretations.

00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:53.236 A:middle
What is yours?

00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:56.036 A:middle
I think this is really important

00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:58.106 A:middle
to ask yourself, what is

00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:59.356 A:middle
quality, and what does it mean

00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.236 A:middle
to you, and what does it mean to
