00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:01.996 A:middle
things that don't make me feel

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
uncomfortable, or dumb, or

00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:05.976 A:middle
[laughs] or inconvenienced.

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:09.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you just launch the app

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.036 A:middle
and you feel, as you use it, oh,

00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:12.686 A:middle
well, this feels like

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.666 A:middle
state-of-the-art technology that

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:15.366 A:middle
I'm using.

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:16.836 A:middle
This feels like it's easier for

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:18.136 A:middle
me to get things done.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.706 A:middle
I feel more productive.

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.136 A:middle
I feel like I'm able to achieve

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:21.996 A:middle
better results.

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:25.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All the concentration that

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.636 A:middle
you're building up goes to the

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:28.806 A:middle
task at hand, the thing that you

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:29.636 A:middle
actually want to do.

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.236 A:middle
And that to me feels like

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:31.746 A:middle
quality.

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:32.966 A:middle
If you're able to achieve that,

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.936 A:middle
and people can be very creative,

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
and make beautiful things, or

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.536 A:middle
have special moments through a

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:41.096 A:middle
device -- for example, by taking

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:42.456 A:middle
really good pictures, or sharing

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.166 A:middle
pictures with friends, or

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:45.696 A:middle
finding the right music to play

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:47.576 A:middle
at the right moment, or, you

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:48.696 A:middle
know, doing fun stuff with

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.876 A:middle
FaceTime, and seeing people on

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:50.746 A:middle
the other side of the world that

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:51.676 A:middle
you haven't seen in a long time

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:53.206 A:middle
-- all of that is very special.

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.376 A:middle
And again, none of that is

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:56.686 A:middle
around the UI that you're doing.

00:05:56.686 --> 00:05:58.656 A:middle
None of that is about what

00:05:58.656 --> 00:05:59.986 A:middle
interaction you chose to do that

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:00.276 A:middle
stuff.
