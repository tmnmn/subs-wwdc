00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.286 A:middle
that the other person is going

00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:03.006 A:middle
to understand the way you mean

00:36:03.006 --> 00:36:05.036 A:middle
it, and that's very difficult

00:36:05.036 --> 00:36:06.106 A:middle
when you're talking about shape.

00:36:06.696 --> 00:36:08.976 A:middle
But one way we started doing

00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:10.266 A:middle
that with some of my colleagues

00:36:10.266 --> 00:36:12.386 A:middle
was basically redrawing the

00:36:12.386 --> 00:36:14.076 A:middle
shape we're looking at with

00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:16.566 A:middle
exaggerated features, where we

00:36:16.566 --> 00:36:18.406 A:middle
basically kind of make a

00:36:18.406 --> 00:36:19.676 A:middle
caricature of what we are

00:36:19.676 --> 00:36:20.156 A:middle
seeing.

00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:22.916 A:middle
So if I'm pushing what I'm

00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:25.366 A:middle
seeing to the extreme of why I

00:36:25.476 --> 00:36:27.966 A:middle
find it ugly or uncomfortable,

00:36:28.256 --> 00:36:30.456 A:middle
it's because it feels like that

00:36:30.456 --> 00:36:30.696 A:middle
to me.

00:36:31.536 --> 00:36:32.616 A:middle
And through that drawing,

00:36:32.616 --> 00:36:33.876 A:middle
usually the other people can

00:36:33.876 --> 00:36:36.076 A:middle
start seeing that much more

00:36:36.076 --> 00:36:38.506 A:middle
toned down but existing feature

00:36:38.506 --> 00:36:40.116 A:middle
of the design that they weren't

00:36:40.116 --> 00:36:41.616 A:middle
necessarily perceiving before

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:42.906 A:middle
because that's not what they

00:36:42.906 --> 00:36:44.386 A:middle
were looking at.

00:36:44.486 --> 00:36:46.086 A:middle
So it is about trying to make

00:36:46.086 --> 00:36:48.466 A:middle
people see the world through

00:36:48.526 --> 00:36:50.416 A:middle
your eyes and the other way

00:36:50.476 --> 00:36:52.206 A:middle
around, like gaining the ability

00:36:52.206 --> 00:36:53.206 A:middle
to see the world through their

00:36:53.206 --> 00:36:55.686 A:middle
eyes, so that you can then find

00:36:55.686 --> 00:36:56.926 A:middle
that third place that is

00:36:56.926 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
actually the joint gaze that you
