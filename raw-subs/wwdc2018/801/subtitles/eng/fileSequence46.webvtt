00:45:58.836 --> 00:46:00.366 A:middle
work and keep those other

00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:02.706 A:middle
people's experiences in mind.

00:46:03.636 --> 00:46:05.296 A:middle
So design is a really

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:06.936 A:middle
collaborative process, and

00:46:06.936 --> 00:46:08.336 A:middle
there's a lot that goes into

00:46:08.336 --> 00:46:09.706 A:middle
making collaboration work.

00:46:10.396 --> 00:46:12.146 A:middle
At one point or another, we're

00:46:12.146 --> 00:46:13.386 A:middle
all going to start on a new

00:46:13.386 --> 00:46:15.636 A:middle
project or a new team, so what

00:46:15.686 --> 00:46:17.806 A:middle
helps make that process a little

00:46:17.806 --> 00:46:18.456 A:middle
bit easier?

00:46:20.306 --> 00:46:21.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I always like to set

00:46:21.306 --> 00:46:22.236 A:middle
expectations upfront.

00:46:22.886 --> 00:46:24.666 A:middle
I just say, hey, this is how I

00:46:24.736 --> 00:46:25.016 A:middle
am.

00:46:25.576 --> 00:46:27.956 A:middle
This is how I work.

00:46:28.006 --> 00:46:29.386 A:middle
This is how I communicate.

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.196 A:middle
How do you work?

00:46:30.196 --> 00:46:31.356 A:middle
How do you communicate?

00:46:31.356 --> 00:46:32.806 A:middle
What's your preferred method of

00:46:32.866 --> 00:46:33.586 A:middle
communication?

00:46:33.586 --> 00:46:36.076 A:middle
And by the way, here's the goals

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:38.126 A:middle
that I think we are working

00:46:38.126 --> 00:46:38.516 A:middle
toward.

00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:39.856 A:middle
And here are the things that are

00:46:39.856 --> 00:46:40.566 A:middle
important to me.

00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:42.246 A:middle
And please share with me the

00:46:42.246 --> 00:46:43.186 A:middle
same for you.

00:46:43.746 --> 00:46:45.396 A:middle
And I'll always sort of say it

00:46:45.396 --> 00:46:46.666 A:middle
with a caveat like, "We're going

00:46:46.666 --> 00:46:47.946 A:middle
to get all this business out of

00:46:47.946 --> 00:46:48.836 A:middle
the way, and we're going to

00:46:48.946 --> 00:46:52.826 A:middle
speak very directly about it."

00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:55.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I know for me, talking about

00:46:55.666 --> 00:46:56.896 A:middle
communication can be awkward,

00:46:57.666 --> 00:46:59.056 A:middle
but after I tried this

00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:00.686 A:middle
technique, I learned that it
