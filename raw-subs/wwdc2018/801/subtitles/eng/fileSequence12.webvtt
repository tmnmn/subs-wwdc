00:11:57.956 --> 00:12:00.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I look at it from 2 lenses of

00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:00.666 A:middle
care.

00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:02.056 A:middle
Did I care enough to make it the

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:02.706 A:middle
best it could be?

00:12:02.706 --> 00:12:04.716 A:middle
But do I also care about what

00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:05.816 A:middle
your experience is?

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:07.006 A:middle
Be it you.

00:12:07.006 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
Be it my mum.

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:09.536 A:middle
Be it my next-door neighbor.

00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:11.436 A:middle
Be it anybody around the world.

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:12.836 A:middle
You have to kind of, sort of

00:12:12.936 --> 00:12:13.946 A:middle
take yourself out of the

00:12:13.946 --> 00:12:15.266 A:middle
equation, put yourself in their

00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:17.206 A:middle
shoes so you can be sure that

00:12:17.206 --> 00:12:18.516 A:middle
their experience is a quality

00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:19.216 A:middle
experience.

00:12:19.616 --> 00:12:20.956 A:middle
So you have to care enough to do

00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:21.246 A:middle
that.

00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:22.776 A:middle
It's not just about caring about

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:25.026 A:middle
your own sense of, "Oh, I like

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:27.336 A:middle
my design, and I cared enough to

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:28.726 A:middle
make it good for me."

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.946 A:middle
It's about it being good for as

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:33.056 A:middle
many people as possible or for

00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:34.326 A:middle
the target audience, if it

00:12:34.326 --> 00:12:35.526 A:middle
happens to be a more narrowly

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:36.176 A:middle
focused thing.

00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:40.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So when I heard this,

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.836 A:middle
I was just, I wanted to know

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:43.426 A:middle
how, immediately.

00:12:43.676 --> 00:12:45.276 A:middle
How do you design that

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:47.156 A:middle
experience for others, and how

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:48.076 A:middle
do you know when you've made

00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:48.496 A:middle
progress?

00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:51.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think sometimes we look at

00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:53.256 A:middle
a tangled mess of problems that

00:12:53.256 --> 00:12:55.466 A:middle
we need to solve, and if, at the

00:12:55.466 --> 00:12:57.006 A:middle
end, you can look at the result

00:12:57.006 --> 00:12:58.906 A:middle
and go, that is so much better,

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
and if it came easy, it wouldn't
