00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
So we talked a little bit

00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:02.536 A:middle
further about this, and Caroline

00:27:02.536 --> 00:27:04.656 A:middle
explained that what she means by

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:07.636 A:middle
polish is things lining up just

00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:08.986 A:middle
the way you intend them to be,

00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:10.956 A:middle
including how it feels.

00:27:10.956 --> 00:27:12.346 A:middle
You know, swipe animations

00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:14.006 A:middle
lining right up with those swipe

00:27:14.046 --> 00:27:14.596 A:middle
gestures.

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.036 A:middle
And the best apps appear

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:18.916 A:middle
visually perfect, and that is

00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:20.346 A:middle
just totally remarkable.

00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:22.506 A:middle
And she also mentioned games.

00:27:23.216 --> 00:27:25.676 A:middle
Games should absolutely aspire

00:27:25.776 --> 00:27:26.406 A:middle
to be stunning.

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:29.706 A:middle
Games are a perfect escape from

00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:32.316 A:middle
this world into a different one.

00:27:32.896 --> 00:27:34.656 A:middle
And they accomplish this through

00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:36.586 A:middle
stunning, immersive visuals.

00:27:37.806 --> 00:27:39.466 A:middle
I mean, I love TV and movies,

00:27:39.546 --> 00:27:41.056 A:middle
but that's a really passive

00:27:41.056 --> 00:27:41.626 A:middle
escape.

00:27:42.186 --> 00:27:43.416 A:middle
In games, well, they're an

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:44.986 A:middle
active one, and that's why I

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:45.586 A:middle
love them.

00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:48.036 A:middle
But there is one essential thing

00:27:48.386 --> 00:27:49.896 A:middle
that all games must do.

00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:53.386 A:middle
They must teach you, the player,

00:27:53.626 --> 00:27:53.926 A:middle
the rules.

00:27:53.926 --> 00:27:56.086 A:middle
And this is really a first

00:27:56.086 --> 00:27:57.536 A:middle
impression that people have of a

00:27:57.536 --> 00:27:59.996 A:middle
lot of games, so it makes me

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.426 A:middle
really sad when games make a bad
