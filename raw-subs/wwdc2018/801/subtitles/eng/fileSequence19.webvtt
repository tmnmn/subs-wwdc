00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
quality coffee or quality meats.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:02.826 A:middle
And even one night when I was

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:03.936 A:middle
working really late, and I

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.366 A:middle
ordered a pizza, and the pizza

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.566 A:middle
box said, "Our commitment is

00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:08.286 A:middle
quality."

00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:11.106 A:middle
[laughs] So I see the word

00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:12.346 A:middle
everywhere now.

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:14.516 A:middle
It's really pervasive, from

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:16.746 A:middle
signs to badges, to labels.

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:19.246 A:middle
So I brought this up in a few of

00:19:19.246 --> 00:19:21.106 A:middle
the interviews, not because I

00:19:21.106 --> 00:19:22.236 A:middle
wanted to know what people

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.866 A:middle
thought of labeling, but,

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:26.886 A:middle
instead, to ask, why do we tend

00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:28.866 A:middle
to be drawn towards things that

00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:29.606 A:middle
are quality?

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, survival instinct at

00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:34.556 A:middle
its root.

00:19:35.036 --> 00:19:36.536 A:middle
On a more deep level, I guess,

00:19:36.536 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
why do we desire quality?

00:19:38.296 --> 00:19:39.826 A:middle
We desire quality because we

00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:40.406 A:middle
want to live.

00:19:41.176 --> 00:19:44.096 A:middle
And a good survival strategy for

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:47.626 A:middle
living is to put things into our

00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:50.296 A:middle
body, to eat things, or to wear

00:19:50.296 --> 00:19:52.066 A:middle
things, or to drive in things,

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:54.396 A:middle
or to live in things that are

00:19:54.656 --> 00:19:56.936 A:middle
safe and have been well

00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:59.036 A:middle
constructed so they aren't going

00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.936 A:middle
to cause us bodily harm.
