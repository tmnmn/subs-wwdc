to cause us bodily harm.

00:20:01.616 --> 00:20:04.906 A:middle
And so I think purely on a

00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:07.236 A:middle
survival level, quality is a

00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.986 A:middle
very important concept for us.

00:20:08.986 --> 00:20:10.376 A:middle
It's a very important attribute

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.666 A:middle
that we seek in everything.

00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:16.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Mike explained a bit further

00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:17.336 A:middle
during this interview.

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:18.996 A:middle
We were talking about this

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:22.356 A:middle
fictitious butcher shop, and if

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:24.296 A:middle
we were in this shop, quality

00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:25.886 A:middle
would be communicated not only

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:28.266 A:middle
by the products itself, but also

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:30.706 A:middle
the shop being really clean and

00:20:30.706 --> 00:20:31.946 A:middle
interacting with the really nice

00:20:32.076 --> 00:20:33.146 A:middle
people that work there.

00:20:34.236 --> 00:20:36.246 A:middle
Every facet of the entire

00:20:36.246 --> 00:20:38.776 A:middle
experience would meet your

00:20:38.776 --> 00:20:40.436 A:middle
expectations, [laughs] and it

00:20:40.436 --> 00:20:42.506 A:middle
would also be connected to that

00:20:42.646 --> 00:20:44.216 A:middle
proposition of quality.

00:20:44.796 --> 00:20:48.266 A:middle
And that evokes trust.

00:20:49.546 --> 00:20:51.296 A:middle
Trust comes from products

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.906 A:middle
upholding their promise, and

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:56.046 A:middle
that quality experience is far

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.956 A:middle
more important than any label

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
because I am definitely not
