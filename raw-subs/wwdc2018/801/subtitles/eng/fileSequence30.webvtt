00:29:59.626 --> 00:30:01.136 A:middle
everyone can learn from what Sam

00:30:01.176 --> 00:30:03.266 A:middle
said about active discovery.

00:30:03.706 --> 00:30:05.256 A:middle
And this is not just for games.

00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
Active discovery is so much

00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:09.696 A:middle
better than reading tooltips or

00:30:09.696 --> 00:30:12.106 A:middle
chasing a pointing arrow, and to

00:30:12.196 --> 00:30:14.826 A:middle
Sam's point, being told isn't as

00:30:14.826 --> 00:30:17.206 A:middle
much fun or, frankly, effective

00:30:17.436 --> 00:30:19.016 A:middle
as discovering something for

00:30:19.016 --> 00:30:19.516 A:middle
yourself.

00:30:20.686 --> 00:30:22.346 A:middle
It's kind of like being told

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:24.876 A:middle
about a vacation versus being on

00:30:24.876 --> 00:30:25.906 A:middle
that vacation yourself.

00:30:26.706 --> 00:30:28.246 A:middle
It's way more fun, and you're

00:30:28.246 --> 00:30:29.666 A:middle
just going to remember it better

00:30:29.666 --> 00:30:31.416 A:middle
if you actually go through that

00:30:31.416 --> 00:30:32.116 A:middle
experience.

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:35.106 A:middle
So whether you're creating an

00:30:35.106 --> 00:30:38.176 A:middle
app or a game, aspire to be

00:30:38.176 --> 00:30:38.776 A:middle
stunning.

00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:41.136 A:middle
Create beautiful experiences,

00:30:41.646 --> 00:30:43.696 A:middle
polish your visual design so it

00:30:43.696 --> 00:30:45.856 A:middle
looks and feels just a part of

00:30:45.856 --> 00:30:47.436 A:middle
your app or game's world.

00:30:47.956 --> 00:30:49.816 A:middle
Okay, timeless.

00:30:51.236 --> 00:30:54.156 A:middle
This has been on my mind since

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:55.586 A:middle
talking with Hugo, a sound

00:30:55.586 --> 00:30:56.036 A:middle
designer.

00:30:56.716 --> 00:30:59.136 A:middle
Most of you will recognize this.
