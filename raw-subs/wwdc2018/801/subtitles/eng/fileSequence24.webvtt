00:23:59.686 --> 00:24:01.106 A:middle
simple, and why is that a good

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:01.476 A:middle
thing?

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:03.926 A:middle
Well, it finally clicked for me

00:24:03.926 --> 00:24:05.176 A:middle
one day after work.

00:24:06.326 --> 00:24:08.006 A:middle
I got home, I needed to cook

00:24:08.006 --> 00:24:09.736 A:middle
some dinner, and I needed an app

00:24:10.026 --> 00:24:11.856 A:middle
to help me with a recipe, to not

00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:13.306 A:middle
make cooking any harder than it

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:13.966 A:middle
already is.

00:24:14.566 --> 00:24:15.806 A:middle
And as soon as I was home, I

00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:18.156 A:middle
remembered that I needed to go

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:20.166 A:middle
ahead and put, book pet care for

00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:21.936 A:middle
my two dogs because I'm going on

00:24:21.936 --> 00:24:22.846 A:middle
vacation after WWDC.

00:24:22.846 --> 00:24:23.786 A:middle
Aw, aren't they cute?

00:24:24.736 --> 00:24:28.176 A:middle
[laughs] Okay, we have to stop

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.066 A:middle
before I get distracted.

00:24:29.066 --> 00:24:31.136 A:middle
We're talking about two tasks

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:34.176 A:middle
here, cooking dinner and pet

00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:34.476 A:middle
care.

00:24:35.636 --> 00:24:36.906 A:middle
Why do the apps that help me

00:24:36.906 --> 00:24:38.166 A:middle
with those, why do they need to

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:38.826 A:middle
be simple?

00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:41.546 A:middle
Well, it's because I don't go

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.746 A:middle
into them all the time, so they

00:24:43.746 --> 00:24:44.886 A:middle
need to be instantly

00:24:44.886 --> 00:24:46.546 A:middle
understandable, as if I already

00:24:46.546 --> 00:24:47.526 A:middle
know how to use them.

00:24:47.996 --> 00:24:49.556 A:middle
So familiar navigation and

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:50.616 A:middle
gestures really help with that.

00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:53.196 A:middle
You know, the goal is launch the

00:24:53.196 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
app, I totally get it, and I can

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:56.466 A:middle
get the task done.

00:24:57.466 --> 00:24:58.766 A:middle
But why else should they be

00:24:58.766 --> 00:24:59.206 A:middle
simple?
