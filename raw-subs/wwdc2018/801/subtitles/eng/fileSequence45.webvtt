00:44:58.686 --> 00:45:00.156 A:middle
To be unassuming when you're

00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:02.046 A:middle
designing for so many people.

00:45:03.016 --> 00:45:05.376 A:middle
And that is a really great

00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:06.646 A:middle
headspace to be in when you're

00:45:06.646 --> 00:45:08.846 A:middle
approaching design; to be modest

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.686 A:middle
and to be mindful.

00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:14.656 A:middle
So how do you help keep people's

00:45:14.656 --> 00:45:16.606 A:middle
experiences top of mind when

00:45:16.606 --> 00:45:17.246 A:middle
you're designing?

00:45:17.906 --> 00:45:19.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So in many ways, I just have

00:45:19.826 --> 00:45:21.966 A:middle
to be skeptical and ask

00:45:21.966 --> 00:45:23.516 A:middle
questions if the idea in front

00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:25.566 A:middle
of me, is that going to work for

00:45:25.566 --> 00:45:27.266 A:middle
someone in a wheelchair, for

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:27.726 A:middle
example?

00:45:27.726 --> 00:45:28.866 A:middle
Is that going to work for

00:45:28.866 --> 00:45:33.086 A:middle
someone that has never used this

00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:33.686 A:middle
app before?

00:45:33.686 --> 00:45:36.476 A:middle
Is it going to work for someone

00:45:36.476 --> 00:45:37.996 A:middle
coming from a PC to a Mac?

00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:39.716 A:middle
You just have to ask lots of

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:41.756 A:middle
questions, and it can just start

00:45:41.756 --> 00:45:43.206 A:middle
people thinking about, oh, yeah,

00:45:43.206 --> 00:45:44.456 A:middle
did I care enough to consider

00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:47.346 A:middle
that aspect of it?

00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:49.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So this may seem

00:45:49.816 --> 00:45:51.996 A:middle
really simple, but it's

00:45:51.996 --> 00:45:53.756 A:middle
important to ask questions,

00:45:54.106 --> 00:45:55.236 A:middle
especially from different

00:45:55.236 --> 00:45:55.956 A:middle
perspectives.

00:45:56.466 --> 00:45:57.296 A:middle
That's going to help you

00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:58.836 A:middle
maintain quality throughout your

00:45:58.836 --> 00:46:00.366 A:middle
work and keep those other
