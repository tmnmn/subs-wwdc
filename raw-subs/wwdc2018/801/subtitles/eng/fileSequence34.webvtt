itself in really different ways

00:34:01.216 --> 00:34:02.896 A:middle
depending on your app.

00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:04.166 A:middle
It could be maybe that

00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:05.586 A:middle
positivity is being really

00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:07.566 A:middle
accurate, or maybe it's just

00:34:07.566 --> 00:34:08.706 A:middle
being super entertaining.

00:34:09.616 --> 00:34:10.806 A:middle
Maybe it's just making someone's

00:34:10.806 --> 00:34:13.216 A:middle
life or day feel a little bit

00:34:13.216 --> 00:34:13.656 A:middle
easier.

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:16.466 A:middle
I hope that you found some of

00:34:16.466 --> 00:34:17.396 A:middle
these thoughts to be as

00:34:17.396 --> 00:34:18.706 A:middle
inspiring as I did.

00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:21.186 A:middle
I'm sure you're thinking now,

00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:22.735 A:middle
though, well, sure, this has

00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:24.545 A:middle
been mildly inspiring and

00:34:24.636 --> 00:34:26.706 A:middle
somewhat educational, but what

00:34:26.706 --> 00:34:27.585 A:middle
can I do?

00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:29.196 A:middle
What can I actually take away

00:34:29.196 --> 00:34:30.476 A:middle
and apply to my work?

00:34:30.476 --> 00:34:33.186 A:middle
Well, I wanted to know that too.

00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:35.326 A:middle
After talking with so many

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:36.536 A:middle
different people from different

00:34:36.536 --> 00:34:38.545 A:middle
backgrounds, I wanted to know

00:34:38.646 --> 00:34:40.426 A:middle
what they learned -- what they

00:34:40.426 --> 00:34:42.045 A:middle
learned on the job through their

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:43.036 A:middle
experiences.

00:34:43.576 --> 00:34:44.476 A:middle
So through a series of

00:34:44.476 --> 00:34:46.456 A:middle
questions, I uncovered a few

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:48.616 A:middle
tips and techniques that these

00:34:48.616 --> 00:34:50.755 A:middle
designers use regularly when

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:51.306 A:middle
designing.

00:34:52.005 --> 00:34:53.295 A:middle
And something important to

00:34:53.295 --> 00:34:54.786 A:middle
mention about design before we

00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:58.726 A:middle
get started is, yes, design is

00:34:58.756 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
hard because nobody sets out to
