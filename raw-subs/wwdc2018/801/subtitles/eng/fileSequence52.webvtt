My car's not green.

00:52:00.486 --> 00:52:04.866 A:middle
But I just like the idea of

00:52:04.926 --> 00:52:05.346 A:middle
green.

00:52:05.696 --> 00:52:07.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I can't pick one because

00:52:08.026 --> 00:52:09.326 A:middle
I wouldn't be able to pick a

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:12.966 A:middle
single musical note, so I'll use

00:52:12.966 --> 00:52:14.476 A:middle
all of them where it makes

00:52:14.476 --> 00:52:14.876 A:middle
sense.

00:52:15.786 --> 00:52:17.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'll need to check the spec

00:52:17.846 --> 00:52:19.046 A:middle
on that, I think.

00:52:19.456 --> 00:52:20.806 A:middle
System blue, of course.

00:52:20.806 --> 00:52:20.936 A:middle
Yeah.

00:52:26.126 --> 00:52:27.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Special thanks to everyone

00:52:27.466 --> 00:52:28.486 A:middle
who participated in these

00:52:28.486 --> 00:52:29.026 A:middle
interviews.

00:52:29.476 --> 00:52:30.766 A:middle
Thank you all so much.

00:52:30.826 --> 00:52:32.276 A:middle
Have a great WWDC.
