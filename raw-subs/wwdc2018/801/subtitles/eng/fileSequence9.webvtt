00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:00.376 A:middle
it out that it's a little

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:03.296 A:middle
clichÃ©, but before we listen to

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:05.136 A:middle
the rest of this clip, I need

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.286 A:middle
you to imagine that you're in

00:09:07.316 --> 00:09:08.606 A:middle
the audio booth with us.

00:09:09.506 --> 00:09:10.566 A:middle
There's not going to be anything

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:12.106 A:middle
on screen, so I want you to

00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:14.216 A:middle
really focus on the words that

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:15.346 A:middle
Mike is about to say.

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:19.016 A:middle
Okay, here we go.

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We're sitting in this room

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.666 A:middle
here, and there's these panels

00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:24.586 A:middle
on the wall, and the panels have

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:26.006 A:middle
a little bit of a gap between

00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:26.096 A:middle
them.

00:09:26.096 --> 00:09:28.516 A:middle
And we can look at the width of

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:31.376 A:middle
the gap as you look from the top

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:33.186 A:middle
of the wall to the bottom of the

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:33.556 A:middle
wall.

00:09:33.986 --> 00:09:36.126 A:middle
And if there's variable

00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:37.836 A:middle
separation or variable width of

00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:39.816 A:middle
that gap, you just get the sense

00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:42.076 A:middle
that it wasn't well crafted.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. So really, while Mike

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:48.836 A:middle
was talking about those variable

00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:50.606 A:middle
widths in the gaps of the panels

00:09:50.636 --> 00:09:52.866 A:middle
in the audio booth, you know, I

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:54.316 A:middle
understood that he's saying that

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.716 A:middle
those details are visible, and

00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:58.116 A:middle
they matter a lot.

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.626 A:middle
And it's through consideration
