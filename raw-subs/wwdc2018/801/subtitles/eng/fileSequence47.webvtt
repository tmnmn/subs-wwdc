00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:00.686 A:middle
technique, I learned that it

00:47:00.686 --> 00:47:03.316 A:middle
helps avoid so much drama and

00:47:03.316 --> 00:47:04.016 A:middle
confusion.

00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:06.866 A:middle
So talk about communication,

00:47:07.566 --> 00:47:08.506 A:middle
especially if you're working on

00:47:08.616 --> 00:47:08.986 A:middle
teams.

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.346 A:middle
Work towards the same goal about

00:47:11.346 --> 00:47:12.556 A:middle
creating something great.

00:47:14.026 --> 00:47:16.396 A:middle
So really, these six techniques

00:47:16.796 --> 00:47:18.596 A:middle
are all about caring about the

00:47:18.596 --> 00:47:20.596 A:middle
other people and having tools to

00:47:20.676 --> 00:47:22.566 A:middle
talk about it, and you have to

00:47:22.716 --> 00:47:24.056 A:middle
care about other people and put

00:47:24.056 --> 00:47:24.956 A:middle
yourself second.

00:47:25.766 --> 00:47:27.506 A:middle
Be mindful of their lives and be

00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:29.816 A:middle
modest about your own because we

00:47:29.816 --> 00:47:31.606 A:middle
just learned you can't assume.

00:47:31.876 --> 00:47:33.216 A:middle
You have to go out and try your

00:47:33.216 --> 00:47:35.166 A:middle
designs through prototyping and

00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:36.826 A:middle
also really remain open to

00:47:36.926 --> 00:47:37.476 A:middle
feedback.

00:47:37.976 --> 00:47:39.256 A:middle
That's essential to making

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:42.586 A:middle
progress in design because, as

00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:44.876 A:middle
May-Li said, we all develop

00:47:44.956 --> 00:47:47.866 A:middle
blind spots, and we're not only

00:47:47.866 --> 00:47:50.026 A:middle
designing to make progress, but

00:47:50.026 --> 00:47:51.356 A:middle
we want to get closer to

00:47:51.356 --> 00:47:52.886 A:middle
reaching our own aspirations and

00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:53.446 A:middle
our own goals.

00:47:54.146 --> 00:47:56.866 A:middle
So these techniques are used by

00:47:57.016 --> 00:47:58.656 A:middle
real designers that I talked to,

00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.876 A:middle
and they help them go through
