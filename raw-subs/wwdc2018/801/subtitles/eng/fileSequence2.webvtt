00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:01.186 A:middle
tremendous caliber.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:03.926 A:middle
So I conducted a series of

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:04.416 A:middle
interviews.

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.286 A:middle
I talked to 13 people, and I

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:09.506 A:middle
asked them a ton of questions to

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:11.446 A:middle
discover what quality means to

00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:13.796 A:middle
them, what challenges they face,

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.106 A:middle
and what they do to strive for

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:17.346 A:middle
excellence in design.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.836 A:middle
So before you think any of this

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.086 A:middle
is scripted, I actually didn't

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:24.666 A:middle
give anybody these questions in

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.066 A:middle
advance.

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:26.946 A:middle
So everything you're about to

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:29.986 A:middle
hear today is real reactions to

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:30.756 A:middle
these questions.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.026 A:middle
I collected over 15 hours of

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.396 A:middle
interview footage, and I've

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.596 A:middle
distilled it down to the very

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:39.246 A:middle
essence of these responses.

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:41.826 A:middle
So the audio clips you're about

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.006 A:middle
to hear today represent what I

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.276 A:middle
discovered about quality in

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:47.156 A:middle
great design.

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.196 A:middle
So today, we're going to dig

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:51.826 A:middle
into interpretations of quality

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:53.916 A:middle
and how it influences our

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:55.506 A:middle
perceptions and design

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:56.046 A:middle
directions.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.736 A:middle
We're also going to talk about

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.486 A:middle
its effect on people's lives.
