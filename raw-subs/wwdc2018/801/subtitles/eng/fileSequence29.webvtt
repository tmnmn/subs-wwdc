00:28:58.566 --> 00:29:00.086 A:middle
And when they try something and

00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
they discover something for the

00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
first time, they definitely

00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:03.806 A:middle
won't forget it.

00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:04.886 A:middle
But if we throw up like a

00:29:04.886 --> 00:29:06.746 A:middle
tooltip or some way of just

00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:08.676 A:middle
making sure that we as the game

00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:09.746 A:middle
designers are comfortable

00:29:09.746 --> 00:29:10.426 A:middle
knowing that they know

00:29:10.426 --> 00:29:12.206 A:middle
something, there's a pretty good

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.066 A:middle
chance that they'll forget it

00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:14.676 A:middle
later on since they didn't go

00:29:14.676 --> 00:29:15.676 A:middle
through the process of learning

00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:15.976 A:middle
it themselves.

00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:21.826 A:middle
So when I go into a game for the

00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:24.476 A:middle
first time, I want to learn how

00:29:24.476 --> 00:29:26.776 A:middle
to navigate the world, if it

00:29:26.776 --> 00:29:29.296 A:middle
takes place in a world, as

00:29:29.296 --> 00:29:30.496 A:middle
quickly as possible or just how

00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:31.656 A:middle
to understand the rules of the

00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:33.956 A:middle
game as quickly as possible, but

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.986 A:middle
not so quickly that I'm kind of

00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:37.266 A:middle
robbed of my curiosity to

00:29:37.266 --> 00:29:38.446 A:middle
explore them a little bit

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:38.896 A:middle
further.

00:29:39.446 --> 00:29:42.546 A:middle
So I tend to get a sense for

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:44.646 A:middle
what the game is, and if the

00:29:44.646 --> 00:29:46.466 A:middle
game continues to surprise me,

00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:48.716 A:middle
I'll make it through to the

00:29:48.716 --> 00:29:50.016 A:middle
finish line.

00:29:51.286 --> 00:29:53.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow, that was learning the

00:29:53.376 --> 00:29:55.436 A:middle
rules in Where Cards Fall, and

00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:57.156 A:middle
that definitely feels a part of

00:29:57.156 --> 00:29:59.626 A:middle
the game's world, and I think

00:29:59.626 --> 00:30:01.136 A:middle
everyone can learn from what Sam
