00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.236 A:middle
to you, and what does it mean to

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.436 A:middle
your app or game, because that's

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
going to reveal what you truly

00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.716 A:middle
care about, and that's going to

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.066 A:middle
help you focus on what you're

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.566 A:middle
working towards going forward.

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:13.736 A:middle
So let's just pause here for a

00:16:13.736 --> 00:16:15.106 A:middle
moment, and we actually need to

00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:16.596 A:middle
go back a bit.

00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:17.716 A:middle
Why does quality matter in the

00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:18.356 A:middle
first place?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.096 A:middle
Why are we even talking about it

00:16:20.236 --> 00:16:21.706 A:middle
here at WWDC?

00:16:21.786 --> 00:16:24.936 A:middle
Well, what's the significance?

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:28.346 A:middle
Let's just ask, why is quality

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:29.196 A:middle
important?

00:16:30.536 --> 00:16:34.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Quality impacts the world

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:36.086 A:middle
that we interact with in so many

00:16:36.086 --> 00:16:37.326 A:middle
different ways all the time

00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:38.736 A:middle
throughout our day.

00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:41.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Travis is totally

00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:41.986 A:middle
right.

00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:43.826 A:middle
Throughout our day, there are

00:16:43.916 --> 00:16:47.466 A:middle
things that we eat, drink, wear,

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:49.186 A:middle
I mean, even the air we breathe.

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:50.826 A:middle
They all have some level of

00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:52.396 A:middle
quality that impacts us.

00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:55.706 A:middle
And we expect quality in our

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:57.686 A:middle
friendships, in our family, in

00:16:57.686 --> 00:16:58.616 A:middle
our relationships.

00:16:59.296 --> 00:17:01.046 A:middle
We seek out people who show us
