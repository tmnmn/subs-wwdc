[look of settings in your app UI,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1120) [well, it's going to impact

was](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1141) [working really late, and I](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1142) [ordered a pizza, and the pizza](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1143) [box said, "Our commitment

labels.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1154) [So I brought this up in a few of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1157) [the interviews, not because I](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1159)

but,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1162) [instead, to ask, why do we

a more deep level, I guess,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1175) [why do we desire quality?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1176) [We desire quality because

our](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1184) [body, to eat things, or to wear](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1187) [things, or to drive in things,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1190) [or to live in things that are](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1192) [safe and have been well](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1194)

so I think purely on a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/?time=1201) [survival level, quality is
