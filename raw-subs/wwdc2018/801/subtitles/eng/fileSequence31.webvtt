[ Ringtone ]

00:31:10.696 --> 00:31:11.876 A:middle
I'm always looking for where

00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:13.296 A:middle
that phone is.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.926 A:middle
But what reminded me of this

00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:17.726 A:middle
ringtone was this part of the

00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:18.376 A:middle
interview.

00:31:18.976 --> 00:31:23.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If we create a ringtone for

00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:27.126 A:middle
the new iPhone, then we don't

00:31:27.126 --> 00:31:28.916 A:middle
want it to sound dated after a

00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:29.776 A:middle
year, of course.

00:31:29.776 --> 00:31:31.766 A:middle
It should still be a great

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:34.606 A:middle
ringtone after 5 years, and

00:31:34.606 --> 00:31:35.946 A:middle
maybe people will still remember

00:31:35.946 --> 00:31:36.936 A:middle
it after 10 years.

00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:41.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It was actually this section

00:31:41.696 --> 00:31:43.456 A:middle
of the quote that really made me

00:31:43.576 --> 00:31:45.116 A:middle
think of timelessness.

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:47.486 A:middle
You know, it makes sense for a

00:31:47.486 --> 00:31:49.126 A:middle
ringtone not to want to sound

00:31:49.126 --> 00:31:51.706 A:middle
dated, but this could also apply

00:31:51.706 --> 00:31:53.246 A:middle
to your visual and interaction

00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:54.256 A:middle
design too.

00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:57.726 A:middle
Hugo used this word "durability"

00:31:57.986 --> 00:32:00.006 A:middle
to describe quality during our
