00:36:56.926 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
actually the joint gaze that you

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:01.696 A:middle
have on the world.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:04.916 A:middle
And that's the, that I think to

00:37:04.916 --> 00:37:07.016 A:middle
me is the key of a successful

00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:08.756 A:middle
collaboration in design is

00:37:08.756 --> 00:37:13.656 A:middle
finding that place.

00:37:13.886 --> 00:37:15.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow. Before we even dig into

00:37:15.946 --> 00:37:17.826 A:middle
this technique, have you thought

00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:19.076 A:middle
about type design?

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:20.896 A:middle
I mean, every single letter that

00:37:20.956 --> 00:37:22.956 A:middle
you text, and email, and that

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:24.696 A:middle
you read, that's been designed,

00:37:25.546 --> 00:37:27.666 A:middle
and type designers care so much

00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:29.336 A:middle
about detail that they've

00:37:29.336 --> 00:37:31.176 A:middle
invented ways to communicate

00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:33.256 A:middle
about shape when there are no

00:37:33.256 --> 00:37:33.696 A:middle
words.

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:35.736 A:middle
That's just so cool.

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:38.446 A:middle
So to Loic's point, when you're

00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:40.226 A:middle
designing for others, it's

00:37:40.366 --> 00:37:42.016 A:middle
really necessary to see the

00:37:42.016 --> 00:37:44.046 A:middle
world through their eyes, and

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:45.546 A:middle
this technique helps achieve

00:37:46.596 --> 00:37:46.686 A:middle
that.

00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:50.256 A:middle
So draw caricatures and ask

00:37:50.256 --> 00:37:51.456 A:middle
others to do the same.

00:37:52.196 --> 00:37:53.416 A:middle
It's really the importance of

00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:54.636 A:middle
putting yourself in others'

00:37:54.636 --> 00:37:56.276 A:middle
shoes because you can better

00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:57.496 A:middle
understand their world.

00:37:58.126 --> 00:37:59.686 A:middle
And this is a great tool for

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:01.786 A:middle
communication if words are not
