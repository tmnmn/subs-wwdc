00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
what does she look for in great

00:26:01.006 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
apps?

00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:04.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Make my life feel a little

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:06.396 A:middle
bit easier or make my life feel

00:26:06.396 --> 00:26:08.026 A:middle
a little bit nicer or more

00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:08.816 A:middle
luxurious.

00:26:09.616 --> 00:26:11.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think that is just spot on.

00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:13.946 A:middle
Make my life feel a little bit

00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:17.166 A:middle
easier by being simple, focused,

00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:20.086 A:middle
instantly understandable, and

00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:22.936 A:middle
just do one thing really, really

00:26:22.936 --> 00:26:23.076 A:middle
well.

00:26:23.996 --> 00:26:24.926 A:middle
That is the goal.

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:29.206 A:middle
All right, this next aspiration

00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:31.676 A:middle
is to be stunning, and this came

00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:32.716 A:middle
up when I was talking to

00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:33.406 A:middle
Caroline.

00:26:33.816 --> 00:26:36.626 A:middle
I asked her, "What communicates

00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:38.466 A:middle
great visual design?"

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:41.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Just that polish.

00:26:42.206 --> 00:26:43.646 A:middle
Does it look great?

00:26:43.646 --> 00:26:44.866 A:middle
Does it look stunning?

00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:46.826 A:middle
And then, the other level of

00:26:46.826 --> 00:26:48.926 A:middle
polish, on a different kind of

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:50.516 A:middle
app, like a game or something,

00:26:50.516 --> 00:26:52.716 A:middle
to me is making it feel

00:26:52.836 --> 00:26:54.806 A:middle
beautiful as an experience, like

00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:56.296 A:middle
it feels like a work of art.

00:26:57.626 --> 00:26:58.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
So we talked a little bit
