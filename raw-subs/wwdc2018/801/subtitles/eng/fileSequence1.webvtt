00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.876 A:middle
So when I started to work with

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:02.696 A:middle
potential presenters this year

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.616 A:middle
about their talks, this theme of

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.886 A:middle
quality kept coming up, but

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:09.646 A:middle
nobody was talking about it head

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.276 A:middle
on, so I decided to.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.426 A:middle
But I went about it a little bit

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:14.906 A:middle
differently.

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.576 A:middle
I decided to talk to great

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.806 A:middle
designers from our developer

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:21.896 A:middle
community, such as the creative

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.456 A:middle
director at The Game Band.

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:27.376 A:middle
I also talked to the cofounders

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:28.866 A:middle
of the Layers Conference, which

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.756 A:middle
is actually happening right now

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:31.616 A:middle
across the street.

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:34.626 A:middle
And I talked to the VP of Design

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:35.716 A:middle
at Khan Academy.

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:37.836 A:middle
I also talked to some of my

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:39.416 A:middle
great colleagues here at Apple

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.426 A:middle
who work in a wide variety of

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:42.326 A:middle
design disciplines.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:46.656 A:middle
They work in type design, sound

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.576 A:middle
design, motion, visual, and

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:50.516 A:middle
interaction design.

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:53.976 A:middle
These are all real people who I

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.246 A:middle
truly admire and respect, and I

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:58.836 A:middle
think they have created great

00:01:58.966 --> 00:01:59.976 A:middle
apps and games that have
