00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.126 A:middle
into just a couple of these

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:00.776 A:middle
responses.

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:02.566 A:middle
I think they're all great, but

00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:04.096 A:middle
let's just dig into this first

00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:04.556 A:middle
one here.

00:08:06.036 --> 00:08:07.386 A:middle
And we're going to listen to the

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.586 A:middle
clip one more time.

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:12.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If something is quality, it

00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.186 A:middle
implies that there is nothing

00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:14.856 A:middle
random about it.

00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; During this interview with

00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:19.446 A:middle
Nicole, she explained that not

00:08:19.446 --> 00:08:22.056 A:middle
random to her meant not slapped

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:22.676 A:middle
together.

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:24.436 A:middle
And she used this word

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:25.646 A:middle
"considered."

00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:28.356 A:middle
Great designs are considered.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.716 A:middle
They're organized, and they show

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:31.986 A:middle
a thought process has taken

00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:32.456 A:middle
place.

00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:33.876 A:middle
And what I found really

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.285 A:middle
interesting is that she said

00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:36.926 A:middle
that that's really visible to

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:39.216 A:middle
people, that that visibility of

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:40.826 A:middle
quality in design actually came

00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:42.506 A:middle
up in another interview when I

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:43.456 A:middle
was talking with Mike.

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:46.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I guess this is probably a

00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:48.306 A:middle
little clichÃ© sounding, but

00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:49.846 A:middle
it's often the little things

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.106 A:middle
that are the telltale signs

00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:52.776 A:middle
about craftsmanship.

00:08:52.996 --> 00:08:54.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, we have to pause right

00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:55.426 A:middle
there because we're about to

00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.136 A:middle
talk about craft in a design

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.266 A:middle
session, and Mike already called

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:00.376 A:middle
it out that it's a little
