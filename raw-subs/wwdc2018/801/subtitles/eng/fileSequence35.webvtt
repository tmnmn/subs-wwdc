00:34:58.756 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
hard because nobody sets out to

00:35:01.306 --> 00:35:02.196 A:middle
create a bad app.

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:04.866 A:middle
Making great designs is what we

00:35:04.946 --> 00:35:07.796 A:middle
all strive for, but let's be

00:35:07.796 --> 00:35:08.206 A:middle
honest.

00:35:08.816 --> 00:35:11.136 A:middle
We don't always achieve it, and

00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.956 A:middle
that's okay because we keep

00:35:12.956 --> 00:35:15.296 A:middle
trying and we learn a lot along

00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:15.516 A:middle
the way.

00:35:16.796 --> 00:35:19.756 A:middle
Okay, let's go ahead and hear

00:35:19.756 --> 00:35:21.546 A:middle
this first technique, and it

00:35:21.546 --> 00:35:22.576 A:middle
really surprised me.

00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:24.196 A:middle
It came up when I was talking

00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:25.166 A:middle
with Loic [phonetic], a type

00:35:25.216 --> 00:35:27.586 A:middle
designer, and I asked him, "What

00:35:27.586 --> 00:35:29.986 A:middle
helps you with your work?"

00:35:30.776 --> 00:35:32.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So in the case of type

00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:33.236 A:middle
design, for instance, we've

00:35:33.796 --> 00:35:35.656 A:middle
developed all kinds of little

00:35:35.826 --> 00:35:36.906 A:middle
drawing tricks.

00:35:36.906 --> 00:35:38.296 A:middle
In type design especially,

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:41.036 A:middle
subjectiveness I feel can

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:42.496 A:middle
[inaudible] even more than in

00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:44.106 A:middle
other aspects of design because

00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:46.706 A:middle
we go to the depth of how the

00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:48.196 A:middle
particular curve of, on the

00:35:48.196 --> 00:35:50.366 A:middle
shoulder of a lowercase m is,

00:35:50.366 --> 00:35:50.916 A:middle
for instance.

00:35:50.916 --> 00:35:52.566 A:middle
And we can have a 10-minute

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:54.906 A:middle
discussion only on that.

00:35:55.046 --> 00:35:56.496 A:middle
But the difficult part is

00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:59.596 A:middle
describing what you see in words

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.286 A:middle
that the other person is going
