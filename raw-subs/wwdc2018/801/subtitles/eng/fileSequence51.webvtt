00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:00.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I would have said glitter,

00:51:00.076 --> 00:51:01.076 A:middle
but it's not a color.

00:51:01.446 --> 00:51:02.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; One of the things that I

00:51:02.436 --> 00:51:04.496 A:middle
really love is Tahitian blue.

00:51:04.616 --> 00:51:06.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But colors to me are like

00:51:06.736 --> 00:51:09.006 A:middle
moods, and I do not have the

00:51:09.006 --> 00:51:09.936 A:middle
same mood every day.

00:51:09.936 --> 00:51:10.796 A:middle
I don't think I even have the

00:51:10.796 --> 00:51:12.516 A:middle
same mood every hour, so.

00:51:12.516 --> 00:51:13.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I really like white.

00:51:14.236 --> 00:51:15.186 A:middle
Is it really a color?

00:51:15.376 --> 00:51:16.366 A:middle
I think that's one of the

00:51:16.366 --> 00:51:17.486 A:middle
reasons why I like it.

00:51:17.486 --> 00:51:18.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My favorite color has been

00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:19.046 A:middle
amber.

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:20.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I mean, lately, it's been

00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:22.216 A:middle
green for some reason.

00:51:22.216 --> 00:51:22.926 A:middle
I don't know why.

00:51:23.026 --> 00:51:25.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I got to go back on this

00:51:25.746 --> 00:51:26.046 A:middle
answer.

00:51:26.046 --> 00:51:29.346 A:middle
Oh, it's actually Pantone 347.

00:51:29.346 --> 00:51:30.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My favorite color is blue.

00:51:31.376 --> 00:51:33.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Like a happy blue, and blue

00:51:33.996 --> 00:51:35.566 A:middle
is, like, always such a color of

00:51:35.566 --> 00:51:37.076 A:middle
responsibility, which is, like,

00:51:37.426 --> 00:51:37.976 A:middle
so me.

00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:39.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But I just think it's, like,

00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:41.596 A:middle
soft and friendly.

00:51:42.036 --> 00:51:44.886 A:middle
And food that's pink tastes

00:51:44.886 --> 00:51:44.976 A:middle
good.

00:51:45.066 --> 00:51:46.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go with red.

00:51:46.416 --> 00:51:47.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Throw out a hex value.

00:51:47.506 --> 00:51:48.996 A:middle
I don't have a favorite color.

00:51:49.446 --> 00:51:50.466 A:middle
Every color's great.

00:51:50.466 --> 00:51:53.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [laughs] All right, maybe

00:51:53.316 --> 00:51:54.886 A:middle
I'll just answer for this moment

00:51:55.096 --> 00:51:56.326 A:middle
in time.

00:51:56.326 --> 00:51:58.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I don't wear any green.

00:51:58.596 --> 00:52:00.376 A:middle
My car's not green.
