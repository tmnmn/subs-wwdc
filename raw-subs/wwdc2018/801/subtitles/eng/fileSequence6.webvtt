00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:00.276 A:middle
stuff.

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:01.736 A:middle
That should all be obvious, and

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.856 A:middle
blatantly unspoken, and just

00:06:03.856 --> 00:06:08.056 A:middle
completely in the background.

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:11.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow. I just love that, that

00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:13.186 A:middle
quality isn't about the UI or

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:15.156 A:middle
interactions, that it's about

00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:16.606 A:middle
the moment, the people.

00:06:17.186 --> 00:06:18.356 A:middle
You know, these are the people

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.686 A:middle
that you're designing for, and

00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:21.806 A:middle
you're helping them create

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:23.896 A:middle
memories and share those moments

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:24.396 A:middle
with others.

00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:27.026 A:middle
That is what this is all about.

00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:30.036 A:middle
So how do you design for that?

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:32.016 A:middle
Well, I actually asked that

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:32.546 A:middle
question.

00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:34.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It's hard.

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:37.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [laughter] Yeah.

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:39.456 A:middle
I hope you weren't actually

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:40.826 A:middle
hoping for a real answer here.

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:42.386 A:middle
It's definitely very hard, and

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:44.186 A:middle
we have 55 minutes to dig into

00:06:44.186 --> 00:06:44.486 A:middle
why.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.396 A:middle
So we just heard a ton of

00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:50.386 A:middle
answers to this question, what

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:51.426 A:middle
is quality?

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:54.436 A:middle
We heard that it is what we

00:06:54.436 --> 00:06:58.886 A:middle
agree upon is good, that it's

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.746 A:middle
not random, it's something that
