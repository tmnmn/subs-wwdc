00:38:58.896 --> 00:39:01.946 A:middle
And I kind of realized that I

00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:03.446 A:middle
didn't know the answer to that.

00:39:03.446 --> 00:39:05.056 A:middle
And then, I realized what he was

00:39:05.056 --> 00:39:07.716 A:middle
really asking is, should we put

00:39:07.716 --> 00:39:10.046 A:middle
all of this energy into making

00:39:10.046 --> 00:39:11.816 A:middle
the changes that you're

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:12.756 A:middle
suggesting?

00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:14.546 A:middle
How can we be sure that that's

00:39:14.546 --> 00:39:15.696 A:middle
the right thing to do?

00:39:15.926 --> 00:39:18.756 A:middle
And to answer that question, I

00:39:19.416 --> 00:39:21.306 A:middle
opened up -- it might have been

00:39:21.306 --> 00:39:23.656 A:middle
Microsoft Paint [laughs] -- and

00:39:23.656 --> 00:39:27.136 A:middle
I drew a picture, and I took it

00:39:27.136 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
out onto the museum floor, and

00:39:29.806 --> 00:39:32.756 A:middle
basically asked visitors to give

00:39:32.756 --> 00:39:35.176 A:middle
me their impression of what they

00:39:35.376 --> 00:39:37.446 A:middle
thought they should do based on

00:39:37.706 --> 00:39:39.176 A:middle
kind of how I had arranged

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.136 A:middle
things on the screen.

00:39:41.606 --> 00:39:42.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So what Doug was talking

00:39:42.816 --> 00:39:44.146 A:middle
about here, and he went on to

00:39:44.226 --> 00:39:46.596 A:middle
explain, that it was this method

00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:48.736 A:middle
of prototyping that helped him

00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:50.026 A:middle
answer that question from his

00:39:50.076 --> 00:39:50.376 A:middle
boss.

00:39:51.206 --> 00:39:53.156 A:middle
Why should we put energy into

00:39:53.156 --> 00:39:53.786 A:middle
your idea?

00:39:54.736 --> 00:39:56.156 A:middle
So what Doug learned at his

00:39:56.276 --> 00:39:58.196 A:middle
first design job was that he

00:39:58.226 --> 00:40:00.096 A:middle
could not assume that his
