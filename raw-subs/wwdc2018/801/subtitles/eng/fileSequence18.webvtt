00:17:59.006 --> 00:18:01.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right? I know these two

00:18:01.136 --> 00:18:02.946 A:middle
ladies absolutely love what they

00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:05.556 A:middle
do, and I know I can feel it

00:18:05.556 --> 00:18:07.046 A:middle
when someone really loves

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:07.676 A:middle
something.

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:10.356 A:middle
And to Elaine's first point, you

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.376 A:middle
know, I think everyone here

00:18:11.376 --> 00:18:13.566 A:middle
knows that Mom and Dad's food

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:15.266 A:middle
just tastes a little bit better

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:17.696 A:middle
because it's made with that care

00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:18.336 A:middle
and love.

00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:21.726 A:middle
So what really Elaine means by

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
this is your intentions are

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:24.706 A:middle
felt.

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.296 A:middle
So if your intention is to

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:29.416 A:middle
create something great and you

00:18:29.416 --> 00:18:31.086 A:middle
do everything you need to do to

00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:32.716 A:middle
achieve that, people are going

00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:33.216 A:middle
to know.

00:18:33.536 --> 00:18:35.586 A:middle
They're going to feel it.

00:18:35.586 --> 00:18:36.856 A:middle
And the reverse is true too.

00:18:37.306 --> 00:18:38.916 A:middle
You know, if you rushed and you

00:18:38.916 --> 00:18:40.206 A:middle
didn't really care about the

00:18:40.206 --> 00:18:41.656 A:middle
look of settings in your app UI,

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.476 A:middle
well, it's going to impact the

00:18:44.476 --> 00:18:46.946 A:middle
overall feeling that people have

00:18:47.106 --> 00:18:48.406 A:middle
about your app.

00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:52.016 A:middle
So throughout the course of

00:18:52.016 --> 00:18:53.906 A:middle
conducting these interviews, I

00:18:53.906 --> 00:18:54.986 A:middle
started to see the word

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:57.236 A:middle
"quality" everywhere, like

00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
quality coffee or quality meats.
