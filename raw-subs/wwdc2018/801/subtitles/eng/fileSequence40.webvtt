00:39:58.226 --> 00:40:00.096 A:middle
could not assume that his

00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:01.236 A:middle
designs were going to work.

00:40:01.236 --> 00:40:03.476 A:middle
And this actually also came up

00:40:03.476 --> 00:40:05.106 A:middle
in my conversation with Gary.

00:40:06.606 --> 00:40:07.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It wasn't just designed on

00:40:07.666 --> 00:40:10.306 A:middle
paper, implemented in code, and

00:40:10.306 --> 00:40:13.046 A:middle
sort of assumed that that was

00:40:13.046 --> 00:40:13.336 A:middle
going to work.

00:40:13.336 --> 00:40:15.906 A:middle
You can't just assume from your

00:40:15.906 --> 00:40:18.266 A:middle
own experience and through

00:40:18.476 --> 00:40:19.756 A:middle
chatting that something's going

00:40:19.756 --> 00:40:20.006 A:middle
to work.

00:40:20.006 --> 00:40:20.766 A:middle
You've really got to go out and

00:40:20.766 --> 00:40:20.956 A:middle
try it.

00:40:23.106 --> 00:40:24.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I think this is the part

00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:25.886 A:middle
that's really important not to

00:40:25.886 --> 00:40:26.326 A:middle
overlook.

00:40:27.516 --> 00:40:28.616 A:middle
You know, in this case, we are

00:40:28.616 --> 00:40:30.296 A:middle
talking about trying designs in

00:40:30.296 --> 00:40:32.906 A:middle
context out in the real world to

00:40:32.906 --> 00:40:35.186 A:middle
vet solutions to problems, and

00:40:35.186 --> 00:40:36.706 A:middle
trying solutions is something

00:40:36.706 --> 00:40:37.956 A:middle
that Sam mentioned too.

00:40:39.486 --> 00:40:42.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; One of our ethos's is to

00:40:42.196 --> 00:40:43.086 A:middle
solve a problem.

00:40:43.286 --> 00:40:45.196 A:middle
Put it in front of players and

00:40:45.306 --> 00:40:46.416 A:middle
see how they react.

00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:47.316 A:middle
See if they're learning what

00:40:47.316 --> 00:40:47.976 A:middle
they need to learn.

00:40:47.976 --> 00:40:49.706 A:middle
And if we need to do more, we'll

00:40:49.706 --> 00:40:50.146 A:middle
do more.

00:40:50.686 --> 00:40:53.386 A:middle
It's impossible to rush the

00:40:53.386 --> 00:40:55.216 A:middle
creative process of making a

00:40:55.216 --> 00:40:57.496 A:middle
game because so much of what's

00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:58.846 A:middle
special about the games that you

00:40:58.846 --> 00:41:01.726 A:middle
remember are decisions that seem
