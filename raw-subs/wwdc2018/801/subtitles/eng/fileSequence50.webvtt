&gt;&gt; A great design is going to be

00:50:01.096 --> 00:50:02.586 A:middle
the product of tremendous amount

00:50:02.586 --> 00:50:04.666 A:middle
of effort, and creativity, and

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:07.316 A:middle
skill, and [laughs] late nights.

00:50:07.476 --> 00:50:10.086 A:middle
It's going to seem effortless,

00:50:10.186 --> 00:50:12.606 A:middle
and it should hopefully recede

00:50:12.606 --> 00:50:14.146 A:middle
in people's consciousness.

00:50:14.736 --> 00:50:16.906 A:middle
And in a way, I think you're

00:50:16.906 --> 00:50:18.656 A:middle
very aware of an interface which

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:20.456 A:middle
has been poorly designed, and

00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:21.706 A:middle
you're not at all aware of an

00:50:21.706 --> 00:50:23.356 A:middle
interface which has been well

00:50:23.356 --> 00:50:23.826 A:middle
designed.

00:50:28.296 --> 00:50:29.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I talked to a lot of

00:50:29.546 --> 00:50:31.586 A:middle
people, and I saved something

00:50:31.626 --> 00:50:33.446 A:middle
special just for the end.

00:50:34.266 --> 00:50:35.856 A:middle
Since I had the opportunity to

00:50:35.936 --> 00:50:37.026 A:middle
talk to so many different

00:50:37.026 --> 00:50:39.566 A:middle
designers, I had to ask them onw

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:40.906 A:middle
final question, and it's

00:50:40.906 --> 00:50:42.226 A:middle
something that I've always

00:50:42.226 --> 00:50:45.036 A:middle
wanted, wondered myself: What

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:47.536 A:middle
are designers' favorite colors?

00:50:50.896 --> 00:50:51.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:53.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My favorite color?

00:50:53.916 --> 00:50:55.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I have to say--

00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:57.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Is there such a thing?

00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:58.816 A:middle
I don't think so.

00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:00.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I would have said glitter,
