00:41:58.796 --> 00:42:00.646 A:middle
technique to help work through

00:42:00.646 --> 00:42:01.866 A:middle
your design decisions.

00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:05.306 A:middle
So we can learn a lot from each

00:42:05.306 --> 00:42:07.356 A:middle
other, so I wanted to know what

00:42:07.356 --> 00:42:09.506 A:middle
advice would one designer give

00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:10.686 A:middle
to another designer.

00:42:11.336 --> 00:42:14.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Learn how to accept, and

00:42:14.776 --> 00:42:16.296 A:middle
sort, and prioritize the

00:42:16.296 --> 00:42:17.846 A:middle
feedback as it comes in, whether

00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:19.036 A:middle
it's from yourself or from

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:19.336 A:middle
others.

00:42:19.906 --> 00:42:21.116 A:middle
You will learn so much more

00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:22.226 A:middle
quickly than if you are

00:42:22.226 --> 00:42:23.966 A:middle
defensive and you just, like,

00:42:23.966 --> 00:42:24.616 A:middle
buckle down.

00:42:26.496 --> 00:42:27.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I personally struggle with

00:42:27.706 --> 00:42:28.526 A:middle
this.

00:42:28.616 --> 00:42:30.266 A:middle
I can almost not help becoming

00:42:30.266 --> 00:42:32.326 A:middle
defensive when I hear feedback

00:42:32.356 --> 00:42:33.406 A:middle
on a project I'm working on.

00:42:33.406 --> 00:42:35.286 A:middle
It's like this instinctual

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.326 A:middle
reaction, especially if I just

00:42:37.356 --> 00:42:38.956 A:middle
spent late nights and weekends

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.026 A:middle
working on something.

00:42:41.066 --> 00:42:43.406 A:middle
But still, I know it's

00:42:43.406 --> 00:42:46.216 A:middle
important, but I wanted to know

00:42:46.216 --> 00:42:46.556 A:middle
why.

00:42:46.736 --> 00:42:49.596 A:middle
Again, why is it important to be

00:42:49.646 --> 00:42:50.676 A:middle
open to feedback?

00:42:52.646 --> 00:42:53.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think there's also just a

00:42:53.966 --> 00:42:55.206 A:middle
reality, which is after you've

00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:57.126 A:middle
used your own work for some

00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:58.716 A:middle
amount of time, you naturally

00:42:58.716 --> 00:43:00.396 A:middle
develop some blind spots.
