00:25:00.286 --> 00:25:02.696 A:middle
Well, it could be a good day or

00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:04.626 A:middle
a bad day, but I'm using these

00:25:04.626 --> 00:25:07.266 A:middle
apps in real life, and that's

00:25:07.266 --> 00:25:08.526 A:middle
where all of my mental energy

00:25:08.526 --> 00:25:10.666 A:middle
should be, not wasted on a

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:13.066 A:middle
confusing app UI, interaction,

00:25:13.296 --> 00:25:14.086 A:middle
or interface.

00:25:14.756 --> 00:25:17.116 A:middle
Apps should not be a burden, and

00:25:17.116 --> 00:25:18.696 A:middle
it's a lot easier to get back to

00:25:18.696 --> 00:25:20.126 A:middle
real life when they're simple.

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.986 A:middle
So how would you describe

00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:25.016 A:middle
simplicity in apps and games?

00:25:25.096 --> 00:25:27.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It just has to work.

00:25:28.086 --> 00:25:31.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Right. It just has to work

00:25:31.056 --> 00:25:32.346 A:middle
for the people that are using

00:25:32.346 --> 00:25:32.636 A:middle
it.

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:34.056 A:middle
But there's actually something

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:34.636 A:middle
else here.

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:36.876 A:middle
You don't want people to feel

00:25:36.876 --> 00:25:37.806 A:middle
distracted.

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:40.756 A:middle
Simple, easy-to-understand apps

00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:43.096 A:middle
that just work, well, they help

00:25:43.136 --> 00:25:44.276 A:middle
keep people focused.

00:25:45.236 --> 00:25:46.566 A:middle
I know for me, I can get really

00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:47.776 A:middle
easily overwhelmed if

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.236 A:middle
something's out of place.

00:25:49.276 --> 00:25:50.446 A:middle
It can just take me out of that

00:25:50.446 --> 00:25:52.246 A:middle
experience, and that makes

00:25:52.316 --> 00:25:53.956 A:middle
getting the task done even

00:25:53.956 --> 00:25:54.426 A:middle
harder.

00:25:54.426 --> 00:25:56.466 A:middle
I was actually talking to Jessie

00:25:56.466 --> 00:25:58.706 A:middle
about this, and I asked her,

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
what does she look for in great
