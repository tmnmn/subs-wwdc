00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.486 A:middle
its effect on people's lives.

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:03.056 A:middle
[laughs] Actually, this is

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:03.946 A:middle
really exciting because it

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:05.456 A:middle
turned out to be so much more

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:06.566 A:middle
than what I expected.

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.286 A:middle
We're also going to hear about

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:11.176 A:middle
aspirations from the designers

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:13.066 A:middle
that I interviewed, to hear what

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:14.576 A:middle
drives them, what goals they

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:15.856 A:middle
have when they're striving for

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:17.886 A:middle
quality, even if those goals

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:18.936 A:middle
seem unattainable.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.746 A:middle
And finally, I want to share

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:23.306 A:middle
some techniques that were

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.176 A:middle
revealed while asking people

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:26.526 A:middle
about their experiences.

00:03:27.226 --> 00:03:28.446 A:middle
And I hope that these techniques

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.156 A:middle
can help you approach the

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:31.946 A:middle
challenge of designing for a lot

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:32.396 A:middle
of people.

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.496 A:middle
So this session is all about the

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:37.086 A:middle
qualities of great design

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.036 A:middle
defined by designers.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.396 A:middle
So let's kick things off, and

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
get started, and hear a few

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:49.046 A:middle
answers to this one simple

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:52.516 A:middle
question: What is quality?

00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:55.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Quality is nothing else than

00:03:55.796 --> 00:04:00.486 A:middle
what we agree upon is good.
