Breakfast Finder.

00:32:00.926 --> 00:32:04.966 A:middle
Now, there's one more thing I

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.216 A:middle
would like to highlight in this

00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:06.756 A:middle
example.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.646 A:middle
You saw how these boxes were a

00:32:09.646 --> 00:32:10.666 A:middle
little bit jittering around

00:32:10.666 --> 00:32:11.496 A:middle
because I was running the

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:12.896 A:middle
detector frame by frame, by

00:32:12.896 --> 00:32:13.636 A:middle
frame, by frame.

00:32:14.346 --> 00:32:16.506 A:middle
Tracking can often be a better

00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:17.086 A:middle
choice here.

00:32:17.376 --> 00:32:20.216 A:middle
Why? Tracking is much faster

00:32:20.216 --> 00:32:21.646 A:middle
even in terms of like running,

00:32:21.646 --> 00:32:22.936 A:middle
than actually these models would

00:32:22.936 --> 00:32:23.116 A:middle
run.

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.136 A:middle
So, redetection takes more time

00:32:27.136 --> 00:32:28.976 A:middle
than actually running a tracking

00:32:28.976 --> 00:32:29.566 A:middle
request.

00:32:31.306 --> 00:32:33.056 A:middle
I can use the tracker basically

00:32:33.056 --> 00:32:34.306 A:middle
if I want to follow now an

00:32:34.306 --> 00:32:37.416 A:middle
object on the screen because

00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:38.376 A:middle
it's a lighter algorithm.

00:32:38.376 --> 00:32:39.306 A:middle
It runs faster.

00:32:39.906 --> 00:32:41.846 A:middle
And on top of it, we have

00:32:41.906 --> 00:32:43.666 A:middle
temporal smoothing so that these

00:32:43.716 --> 00:32:44.896 A:middle
boxes will not jitter around

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.616 A:middle
anymore and if you see some of

00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:47.836 A:middle
our tracking examples, they

00:32:47.836 --> 00:32:48.946 A:middle
actually move nicely and

00:32:48.946 --> 00:32:50.046 A:middle
smoothly across the screen.

00:32:50.966 --> 00:32:52.156 A:middle
If you want to learn more about

00:32:52.156 --> 00:32:54.996 A:middle
tracking, the previous session

00:32:54.996 --> 00:32:56.106 A:middle
from my colleague Sergei,

00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:58.216 A:middle
actually talks about how to do

00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.546 A:middle
all the implementation work of
