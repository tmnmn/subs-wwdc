00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.546 A:middle
all the implementation work of

00:33:01.216 --> 00:33:01.386 A:middle
that.

00:33:02.076 --> 00:33:04.426 A:middle
Alright, last but not least,

00:33:04.426 --> 00:33:06.006 A:middle
let's enhance our Vision mastery

00:33:06.006 --> 00:33:06.876 A:middle
and go into some of our

00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:07.586 A:middle
fundamentals.

00:33:08.556 --> 00:33:10.256 A:middle
Few things are important to know

00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:11.246 A:middle
when dealing with the Vision

00:33:11.246 --> 00:33:11.756 A:middle
framework.

00:33:12.976 --> 00:33:14.206 A:middle
First and foremost, and this is

00:33:14.206 --> 00:33:16.006 A:middle
a common source of problems,

00:33:17.056 --> 00:33:18.066 A:middle
image orientation.

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:21.546 A:middle
Now, not all of our Vision

00:33:21.546 --> 00:33:22.916 A:middle
algorithms are orientation

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:23.496 A:middle
agnostic.

00:33:24.096 --> 00:33:25.106 A:middle
You might have heard early that

00:33:25.106 --> 00:33:26.436 A:middle
we have a new face detector that

00:33:26.436 --> 00:33:28.436 A:middle
is orientation agnostic.

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:30.656 A:middle
But the previous one was not.

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:33.636 A:middle
This means we need to know what

00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:35.016 A:middle
is the upright position of the

00:33:35.016 --> 00:33:35.406 A:middle
image?

00:33:36.296 --> 00:33:38.436 A:middle
And it can be deceiving because

00:33:38.436 --> 00:33:39.866 A:middle
if you look at it and preview on

00:33:39.866 --> 00:33:41.376 A:middle
the final, my image looks

00:33:41.376 --> 00:33:43.046 A:middle
upright, but that is not how it

00:33:43.046 --> 00:33:43.906 A:middle
is stored on disk.

00:33:45.026 --> 00:33:46.466 A:middle
There is something that tells us

00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:48.206 A:middle
how the device is oriented, and

00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:49.086 A:middle
this is called the EXIF

00:33:49.086 --> 00:33:49.896 A:middle
Orientation.

00:33:50.976 --> 00:33:53.856 A:middle
So, if an image is captured,

00:33:53.856 --> 00:33:54.866 A:middle
that's normally in the sensor

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.346 A:middle
orientation, with the EXIF, we

00:33:56.346 --> 00:33:57.716 A:middle
know what is actually upright

00:33:57.906 --> 00:34:00.096 A:middle
and if you pass an URL into
