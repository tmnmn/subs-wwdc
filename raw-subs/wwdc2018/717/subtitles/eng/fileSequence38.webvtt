00:37:58.306 --> 00:38:00.626 A:middle
Does 1.0 always mean it's a 100%

00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:00.976 A:middle
correct?

00:38:01.366 --> 00:38:02.456 A:middle
Not necessarily.

00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:04.326 A:middle
It will fill the criteria of the

00:38:04.326 --> 00:38:06.486 A:middle
algorithm, but our perception,

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:07.766 A:middle
as we saw particularly with the

00:38:07.766 --> 00:38:09.666 A:middle
sweet potato is quite different.

00:38:10.586 --> 00:38:12.646 A:middle
So, when you create an

00:38:12.646 --> 00:38:13.966 A:middle
application that wants to take

00:38:13.966 --> 00:38:15.736 A:middle
advantage of that, please keep

00:38:15.736 --> 00:38:16.376 A:middle
that in mind.

00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:17.316 A:middle
Think of it.

00:38:17.316 --> 00:38:18.396 A:middle
If you would write a medical

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.606 A:middle
application and saying, "Oh, you

00:38:19.606 --> 00:38:21.906 A:middle
have cancer," that might be a

00:38:21.906 --> 00:38:23.626 A:middle
very strong argument where you

00:38:23.626 --> 00:38:25.036 A:middle
want to probably soften that a

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.196 A:middle
little bit depending on like how

00:38:26.196 --> 00:38:27.346 A:middle
sure you can really be on the

00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:27.796 A:middle
results.

00:38:29.326 --> 00:38:31.676 A:middle
So, there are two techniques

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:32.896 A:middle
that you can use for this.

00:38:33.506 --> 00:38:35.016 A:middle
As we saw in the robot shot

00:38:35.016 --> 00:38:36.776 A:middle
example, I used a threshold on

00:38:36.776 --> 00:38:37.916 A:middle
the confidence score because I

00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.766 A:middle
really label the image and I you

00:38:39.946 --> 00:38:40.926 A:middle
know, when it's actually

00:38:40.926 --> 00:38:41.746 A:middle
filtering everything out that

00:38:41.746 --> 00:38:42.956 A:middle
had a low confidence score.

00:38:43.676 --> 00:38:44.646 A:middle
If on the other hand, I want to

00:38:44.646 --> 00:38:46.126 A:middle
create a search application, I

00:38:46.126 --> 00:38:47.686 A:middle
might actually use some of the

00:38:47.686 --> 00:38:50.856 A:middle
images that I had and still show

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:52.506 A:middle
them, probably on the bottom of

00:38:52.546 --> 00:38:53.586 A:middle
the search because there's still

00:38:53.586 --> 00:38:55.326 A:middle
a valid choice, perhaps in the

00:38:55.326 --> 00:38:56.016 A:middle
search results.

00:38:59.916 --> 00:39:03.186 A:middle
As usual, we find some more
