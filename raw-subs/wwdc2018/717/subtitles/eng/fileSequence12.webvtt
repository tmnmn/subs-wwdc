00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:03.086 A:middle
or I use my favorite camera that

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:03.916 A:middle
I already have here.

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:06.716 A:middle
Now, let's see.

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:07.836 A:middle
We're going to take a bunch of

00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:08.916 A:middle
pictures of our [inaudible]

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:09.526 A:middle
motor.

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:13.406 A:middle
And it's kind of important to

00:12:13.406 --> 00:12:14.816 A:middle
just kind of vary it and don't

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:16.186 A:middle
have anything else really in the

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:16.716 A:middle
frame.

00:12:21.426 --> 00:12:24.316 A:middle
So, I'm going for a [inaudible].

00:12:24.316 --> 00:12:26.116 A:middle
I need to have at least ten

00:12:26.116 --> 00:12:26.926 A:middle
different images.

00:12:27.526 --> 00:12:28.066 A:middle
Good choices.

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:29.626 A:middle
I always just like to put it on

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:30.576 A:middle
a different background.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:36.306 A:middle
And make sure that we get a few

00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:37.036 A:middle
captured here.

00:12:37.776 --> 00:12:39.116 A:middle
Perhaps I'm going to hold it a

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:46.996 A:middle
little bit in my hand.

00:12:46.996 --> 00:12:48.906 A:middle
Okay, so we have now a number of

00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:49.326 A:middle
images.

00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:52.346 A:middle
Now, I'm going to go over to my

00:12:52.346 --> 00:12:53.726 A:middle
Mac and actually show you how to

00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:54.736 A:middle
actually do then the training

00:12:54.736 --> 00:12:56.876 A:middle
work for that.

00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
Okay, I'm bringing up my image
