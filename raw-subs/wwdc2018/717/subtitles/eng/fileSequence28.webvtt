00:28:00.196 --> 00:28:01.436 A:middle
And see, they can all be kind of

00:28:01.436 --> 00:28:02.466 A:middle
like in the frame.

00:28:02.566 --> 00:28:03.626 A:middle
I'm going to detect them.

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:06.616 A:middle
So, some mention in these

00:28:06.616 --> 00:28:07.736 A:middle
cooking shows, normally they

00:28:07.736 --> 00:28:09.476 A:middle
show you how to do it, but then

00:28:09.476 --> 00:28:10.876 A:middle
pull the prebaked stuff out of

00:28:10.876 --> 00:28:11.356 A:middle
the oven.

00:28:12.546 --> 00:28:15.016 A:middle
Well, this model, actually has

00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:16.916 A:middle
been baked way before this

00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:18.356 A:middle
croissant has been baked, and I

00:28:18.356 --> 00:28:19.026 A:middle
can prove this.

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:22.456 A:middle
It's fresh.

00:28:22.656 --> 00:28:24.916 A:middle
And still a croissant.

00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:33.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:34.816 A:middle
Alright.

00:28:35.706 --> 00:28:40.426 A:middle
It's fresh but still, got to

00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:41.146 A:middle
chew.

00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:46.766 A:middle
Let's look quickly how this

00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:52.666 A:middle
looks in the code.

00:28:53.266 --> 00:28:54.736 A:middle
So, what did I do differently?

00:28:55.916 --> 00:28:57.116 A:middle
[Inaudible] actually in the

00:28:57.116 --> 00:28:58.296 A:middle
terms of like setting up my

00:28:58.296 --> 00:28:58.956 A:middle
request.

00:28:59.746 --> 00:29:02.726 A:middle
All I have to do is use my Core
