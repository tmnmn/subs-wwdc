00:24:59.016 --> 00:25:01.216 A:middle
background queue, so that

00:25:01.216 --> 00:25:02.366 A:middle
[inaudible] or whatever you do

00:25:02.366 --> 00:25:03.176 A:middle
in the camera, can actually

00:25:03.176 --> 00:25:04.306 A:middle
continuously running.

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:06.256 A:middle
But to do this particularly with

00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:07.656 A:middle
the camera, you do not want to

00:25:07.656 --> 00:25:08.866 A:middle
continuously queue up the

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
buffers coming from the camera.

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:11.336 A:middle
So, you want to drop busy

00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:11.826 A:middle
buffers.

00:25:12.216 --> 00:25:14.006 A:middle
In this case, I said I only work

00:25:14.006 --> 00:25:14.526 A:middle
with one.

00:25:14.526 --> 00:25:15.756 A:middle
That's actually in my use case

00:25:15.756 --> 00:25:16.816 A:middle
scenario works pretty well.

00:25:17.286 --> 00:25:18.586 A:middle
So, I have a queue of 1, and

00:25:18.586 --> 00:25:19.666 A:middle
that's why I simply held onto

00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:21.156 A:middle
one buffer and check, as long as

00:25:21.156 --> 00:25:22.506 A:middle
that one is running, I'm not

00:25:22.506 --> 00:25:23.536 A:middle
queuing new buffers up.

00:25:23.956 --> 00:25:25.906 A:middle
Once I'm done with it, I can

00:25:25.906 --> 00:25:30.266 A:middle
reset and work on the next

00:25:30.876 --> 00:25:31.056 A:middle
buffer.

00:25:31.206 --> 00:25:33.336 A:middle
Now, you might ask, "Why am I

00:25:33.336 --> 00:25:34.906 A:middle
using Vision when I can run this

00:25:34.906 --> 00:25:35.696 A:middle
model in Core ML?

00:25:35.696 --> 00:25:36.646 A:middle
It's a Core ML model."

00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:40.196 A:middle
Well, there is one thing why

00:25:40.196 --> 00:25:41.236 A:middle
this is important to actually

00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:41.746 A:middle
use Vision.

00:25:42.316 --> 00:25:43.676 A:middle
Let's go back and look what we

00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:45.196 A:middle
saw when we looked at our model.

00:25:45.646 --> 00:25:47.616 A:middle
It was the strange number of 299

00:25:47.616 --> 00:25:48.936 A:middle
by 299 pixels.

00:25:49.626 --> 00:25:50.886 A:middle
Now, this is simply how this

00:25:50.886 --> 00:25:51.666 A:middle
model is trained.

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:53.036 A:middle
This is what it wants to ingest.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:54.996 A:middle
But our camera gives us

00:25:54.996 --> 00:25:57.206 A:middle
something like 640 by 480 or

00:25:57.206 --> 00:25:58.746 A:middle
larger resolutions if you want.

00:25:59.876 --> 00:26:02.156 A:middle
Now, Vision is going to do all
