00:08:00.156 --> 00:08:01.496 A:middle
Registration means I can take

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:03.696 A:middle
two images and align them with

00:08:03.696 --> 00:08:04.006 A:middle
each other.

00:08:04.006 --> 00:08:04.836 A:middle
And you're going to tell me,

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:06.026 A:middle
"Okay, if you shift it by this

00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:07.566 A:middle
amount of pixels, this is

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:08.306 A:middle
actually in how they would

00:08:08.306 --> 00:08:08.946 A:middle
actually match."

00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:11.116 A:middle
This is a pretty cheap and fast

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.626 A:middle
algorithm, and it will tell me

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.376 A:middle
if I hold the camera still or if

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:16.976 A:middle
anything is moving in front of

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:19.816 A:middle
the camera.

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:21.616 A:middle
I used VN Translational Image

00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:22.696 A:middle
Registration Request.

00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:23.736 A:middle
I know that is a mouthful.

00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:26.976 A:middle
But that will give me all this

00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:27.606 A:middle
information.

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:29.666 A:middle
So, to visualize this first,

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:31.006 A:middle
let's look at the little video.

00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:33.025 A:middle
What I'm doing in this video is

00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:34.616 A:middle
I show basically a little yellow

00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:36.515 A:middle
line that shows me how basically

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:38.196 A:middle
my camera has moved or the

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.556 A:middle
Registration requests have moved

00:08:39.556 --> 00:08:41.446 A:middle
over the last couple of frames.

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:42.946 A:middle
So, what out for that yellow

00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:44.546 A:middle
line and see if it's long, then

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:45.766 A:middle
I have moved the camera around

00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:46.606 A:middle
quite a bit, and when I'm

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:47.736 A:middle
holding it still, it should

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:48.866 A:middle
actually be a very small line.

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:51.866 A:middle
So, you see the camera is

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.446 A:middle
moving, and now I'm focusing on

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:55.496 A:middle
this, and it gets very short.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.026 A:middle
So, that's just a good idea.

00:08:58.026 --> 00:08:58.846 A:middle
It's like, "Okay, now I'm

00:08:58.846 --> 00:08:59.366 A:middle
holding still.

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.346 A:middle
Now, I want to run my
