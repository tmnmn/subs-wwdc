00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.306 A:middle
zero, to 1,1, in the upper right

00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:00.626 A:middle
corner.

00:35:02.406 --> 00:35:04.016 A:middle
Now what you see here is to that

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:05.896 A:middle
performed face and landmark

00:35:05.896 --> 00:35:06.916 A:middle
detection request.

00:35:07.326 --> 00:35:09.036 A:middle
And you will see that I get the

00:35:09.036 --> 00:35:10.496 A:middle
bounding box for my face, and

00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:11.956 A:middle
the landmarks are actually

00:35:11.956 --> 00:35:14.196 A:middle
reported in relative coordinates

00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:17.106 A:middle
to that bounding box.

00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:18.526 A:middle
If you need to go back into the

00:35:18.526 --> 00:35:19.996 A:middle
image coordinate space, we have

00:35:20.096 --> 00:35:22.006 A:middle
utility functions and VNUtils

00:35:22.006 --> 00:35:22.946 A:middle
like the VN Image [inaudible]

00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:25.476 A:middle
from normalized way to convert

00:35:25.606 --> 00:35:28.006 A:middle
back and forth between those

00:35:29.676 --> 00:35:30.056 A:middle
coordinates.

00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.336 A:middle
Next, let's talk about

00:35:32.336 --> 00:35:33.156 A:middle
confidence scores.

00:35:33.156 --> 00:35:34.376 A:middle
We touched a little bit on this

00:35:34.426 --> 00:35:36.076 A:middle
already during our robot shot

00:35:36.076 --> 00:35:36.626 A:middle
example.

00:35:36.626 --> 00:35:40.186 A:middle
A lot of our algorithms can

00:35:40.186 --> 00:35:42.006 A:middle
express how confident they are

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:42.796 A:middle
in their results.

00:35:43.746 --> 00:35:46.436 A:middle
And that is kind of an important

00:35:46.436 --> 00:35:47.886 A:middle
part to know when I want to

00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:49.706 A:middle
analyze later on what I get out

00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:50.446 A:middle
of these results.

00:35:50.536 --> 00:35:51.716 A:middle
So, if I have a low confidence

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.216 A:middle
of zero, or do I have a high

00:35:53.216 --> 00:35:56.566 A:middle
confidence of 1?

00:35:57.576 --> 00:36:02.676 A:middle
Clicker. Here we go.
