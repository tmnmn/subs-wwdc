00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:00.986 A:middle
not necessarily automatically

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:02.536 A:middle
get the benefits unless you

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:03.996 A:middle
retrain [inaudible] new model.

00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:06.096 A:middle
So, if you start developing with

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:07.536 A:middle
this, this year, and you want to

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:08.666 A:middle
you know, take advantage of

00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:09.866 A:middle
whatever we come out over the

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:11.876 A:middle
next years, hold onto your data

00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
sets so you can actually retrain

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:15.046 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:18.896 A:middle
A few more things about our

00:05:18.896 --> 00:05:21.986 A:middle
feature extractor.

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:23.656 A:middle
It's already on the device, and

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.816 A:middle
that was kind of an important

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:27.716 A:middle
decision for us, because it

00:05:27.716 --> 00:05:29.306 A:middle
makes the disc footprint for

00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:30.776 A:middle
your models significantly

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:31.276 A:middle
smaller.

00:05:32.136 --> 00:05:33.286 A:middle
So, let's compare a little bit.

00:05:34.106 --> 00:05:36.136 A:middle
So, I chose some common, you

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:37.806 A:middle
know, available models that we

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:38.486 A:middle
use today.

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:40.156 A:middle
The first thing would be Resnet.

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.106 A:middle
So, if I train my classifier on

00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:43.446 A:middle
top of Resnet, how big is my

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:43.816 A:middle
model?

00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:45.496 A:middle
Ninety-eight megabytes.

00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:48.486 A:middle
If I use Squeezenet, so

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:49.806 A:middle
Squeezenet is a much smaller

00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:50.146 A:middle
model.

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:51.216 A:middle
It's not capable of

00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:52.306 A:middle
differentiating as many

00:05:52.306 --> 00:05:54.876 A:middle
categories, and that's 5

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:55.406 A:middle
megabytes.

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:57.176 A:middle
So, it's about saving there, but

00:05:57.636 --> 00:05:58.806 A:middle
it will not be as versatile.

00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:00.316 A:middle
Now, how about Vision?
