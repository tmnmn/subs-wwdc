00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.436 A:middle
Augmentation will help you to

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:04.216 A:middle
make this model more robust, but

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.396 A:middle
it doesn't really replace the

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:06.016 A:middle
variety.

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.856 A:middle
So, you still want to have lots

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:09.736 A:middle
of images of your objects that

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:10.616 A:middle
you want to classify.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.966 A:middle
But, with the augmentation, what

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.336 A:middle
we're going to do is, we take an

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:15.496 A:middle
image and we perturb it.

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:17.936 A:middle
So, we have noised it, we blur

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:19.766 A:middle
it, we rotate it, flip it, so it

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.676 A:middle
looks different to the

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:21.886 A:middle
classifier actually when we

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:22.926 A:middle
train it.

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:25.616 A:middle
Let's look a little bit under

00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:26.776 A:middle
the hood of how our training

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:28.186 A:middle
actually works.

00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:30.496 A:middle
You might have already heard it,

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.076 A:middle
the term, transfer learning.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:32.966 A:middle
And this is what we're going to

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:34.626 A:middle
use in Create ML when we train

00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:35.376 A:middle
our classifier.

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:37.716 A:middle
So, we start with a pretrained

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.266 A:middle
model, and that's where all the

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.676 A:middle
heavy lifting actually happens.

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:42.386 A:middle
These models train normally for

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:44.216 A:middle
weeks, and with millions of

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:46.136 A:middle
images, and that is the first

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:47.476 A:middle
starting point that you need to

00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:49.696 A:middle
actually work with this.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:52.136 A:middle
Out of this model, we can use

00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:53.496 A:middle
this as a feature extractor.

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:54.866 A:middle
This gives us a feature vector

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:56.186 A:middle
which is pretty much a numerical

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.586 A:middle
description of what we have in

00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:58.246 A:middle
our image.

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.446 A:middle
Now, you bring in your data and
