00:26:59.626 --> 00:27:00.726 A:middle
get actually like where they

00:27:00.726 --> 00:27:02.216 A:middle
are, but I won't get as many

00:27:02.216 --> 00:27:03.816 A:middle
classifications as I can do with

00:27:03.816 --> 00:27:05.306 A:middle
like our overall image

00:27:05.306 --> 00:27:05.946 A:middle
classifier.

00:27:06.556 --> 00:27:08.666 A:middle
The training is also a little

00:27:08.666 --> 00:27:10.286 A:middle
bit more involved, and with

00:27:10.356 --> 00:27:11.576 A:middle
that, I would like to actually

00:27:11.576 --> 00:27:13.466 A:middle
refer you to the Turi Create

00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:14.826 A:middle
session that was, I believe,

00:27:14.876 --> 00:27:16.286 A:middle
yesterday, where they actually

00:27:16.286 --> 00:27:17.716 A:middle
showed you how to train these

00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:18.436 A:middle
kind of models.

00:27:18.746 --> 00:27:20.106 A:middle
These models are also a little

00:27:20.686 --> 00:27:21.646 A:middle
bit bigger.

00:27:21.836 --> 00:27:24.066 A:middle
So, how does this look?

00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:31.006 A:middle
Let's go over to our demo.

00:27:31.606 --> 00:27:35.946 A:middle
Robot shop is closed.

00:27:39.466 --> 00:27:40.846 A:middle
Time for breakfast.

00:27:42.296 --> 00:27:42.706 A:middle
Alright.

00:27:43.626 --> 00:27:45.196 A:middle
Let me bring up my quick

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.726 A:middle
template here and I have my new

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:47.876 A:middle
little application.

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:49.406 A:middle
It is my Breakfast Finder.

00:27:49.976 --> 00:27:53.186 A:middle
And what do we see?

00:27:53.536 --> 00:27:55.446 A:middle
Oh, we have a croissant, we have

00:27:55.446 --> 00:27:57.616 A:middle
a bagel, and we can identify the

00:27:57.616 --> 00:27:58.356 A:middle
banana.
