00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.446 A:middle
Now, you bring in your data and

00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:02.956 A:middle
we train the set, what we call

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.026 A:middle
the last layer, which is the

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:06.366 A:middle
real classifier, on your label

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.636 A:middle
data and out comes your custom

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:08.976 A:middle
model.

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:12.786 A:middle
Now, I mentioned already this

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.506 A:middle
large, first pretrained model.

00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:16.426 A:middle
And we have something new in

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:17.396 A:middle
Vision for this [inaudible].

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:18.596 A:middle
This is what we call the Vision

00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:19.815 A:middle
FeaturePrint for Scenes.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.676 A:middle
It's available through Create ML

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:24.896 A:middle
and it allows you to train an

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:25.796 A:middle
image classifier.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.236 A:middle
It has been trained on a very

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.836 A:middle
large data set, and it is

00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.766 A:middle
capable of categorizing over a

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:34.936 A:middle
thousand categories.

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:37.296 A:middle
That's a pretty good

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:38.206 A:middle
distribution that you can

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:38.726 A:middle
actually use [inaudible].

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:41.866 A:middle
And we've already used it.

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:43.036 A:middle
Over the last few years, through

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.006 A:middle
some of the user [inaudible]

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:45.216 A:middle
pictures that you've seen in

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:47.056 A:middle
photos, have been actually using

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:48.366 A:middle
this model underneath.

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:51.036 A:middle
We're also going to continuously

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:52.676 A:middle
improve on that model, but

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:53.776 A:middle
there's a small caveat that I

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:54.966 A:middle
would like to kind of highlight

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:55.186 A:middle
here.

00:04:56.336 --> 00:04:57.856 A:middle
When we come out with a new

00:04:57.856 --> 00:04:59.766 A:middle
version of that model, you will

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:00.986 A:middle
not necessarily automatically
