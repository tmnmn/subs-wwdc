00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.036 A:middle
that actually mean, "analyze on

00:20:01.036 --> 00:20:01.836 A:middle
the current image."

00:20:02.516 --> 00:20:04.496 A:middle
So, when it's time to analyze

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:07.446 A:middle
it, I get my device orientation,

00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:09.326 A:middle
which is important to know how

00:20:09.326 --> 00:20:10.936 A:middle
am I holding my phone.

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:13.116 A:middle
I create an image request

00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:14.966 A:middle
handler on that buffer that we

00:20:15.536 --> 00:20:16.626 A:middle
currently want to process.

00:20:17.936 --> 00:20:21.016 A:middle
And asynchronously, I let it

00:20:21.046 --> 00:20:22.586 A:middle
perform its work.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.226 A:middle
That's all I have to do

00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:26.476 A:middle
basically for actually doing the

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.706 A:middle
processing with Core ML and

00:20:28.706 --> 00:20:29.506 A:middle
barcode reading.

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:32.556 A:middle
Now, a few things, just okay.

00:20:32.556 --> 00:20:33.976 A:middle
How do I do the scene stability

00:20:33.976 --> 00:20:34.306 A:middle
part?

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.076 A:middle
So, I have a queue that I can

00:20:36.076 --> 00:20:36.536 A:middle
reset.

00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:38.916 A:middle
I can add my points into that.

00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:41.376 A:middle
And then simply I had created a

00:20:41.376 --> 00:20:43.396 A:middle
function that allows me to look

00:20:43.396 --> 00:20:44.776 A:middle
basically through the queue of

00:20:44.856 --> 00:20:46.096 A:middle
points that I've recorded.

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:47.806 A:middle
And then setting like, "Well, if

00:20:47.806 --> 00:20:49.986 A:middle
they all sum together, only show

00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:51.576 A:middle
a distance of like 20 pixels."

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:52.876 A:middle
Again, that's an empirical value

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:53.546 A:middle
that I chose.

00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:55.376 A:middle
Then I know the scene is stable.

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:56.366 A:middle
So, I'm holding stable.

00:20:56.366 --> 00:20:57.646 A:middle
Nothing is moving in front of my

00:20:57.646 --> 00:20:58.076 A:middle
camera.

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:01.326 A:middle
And then comes our part of catch
