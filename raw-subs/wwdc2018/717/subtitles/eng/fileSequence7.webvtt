00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:00.936 A:middle
In this case, use our Vision

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:02.686 A:middle
Feature Print and we'll

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:04.036 A:middle
[inaudible] the classification.

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:08.636 A:middle
So, that was everything we

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:09.456 A:middle
needed to know about the

00:07:09.456 --> 00:07:09.926 A:middle
training.

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:12.616 A:middle
But, I said there was some

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.976 A:middle
caveats that you want to kind of

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:15.186 A:middle
look at when we deal with the

00:07:16.326 --> 00:07:16.866 A:middle
app.

00:07:16.866 --> 00:07:20.326 A:middle
So, first thing, we only want to

00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:21.826 A:middle
actually run our classifier when

00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:22.606 A:middle
we really have to.

00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:25.666 A:middle
Classifiers are deep

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:26.966 A:middle
convolutional networks that are

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.426 A:middle
pretty computational intensive.

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:30.996 A:middle
So, when we run those, it will

00:07:30.996 --> 00:07:32.646 A:middle
definitely use up kind of you

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:33.996 A:middle
know, some electrons running on

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:35.116 A:middle
the CPU and GPU.

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:36.546 A:middle
So, you don't want to use this

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:37.956 A:middle
unless you really have to.

00:07:38.776 --> 00:07:40.326 A:middle
In the example that I'm going to

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.116 A:middle
show in my demo laters, I really

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:44.206 A:middle
only want to classify if

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:45.816 A:middle
actually the person looks really

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.026 A:middle
at an item and not when just a

00:07:47.026 --> 00:07:48.086 A:middle
camera moves around.

00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:52.186 A:middle
So, I'm asking the question, "Am

00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:53.006 A:middle
I holding still?"

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.216 A:middle
and then I'm going to run my

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:54.846 A:middle
classifier.

00:07:56.106 --> 00:07:56.846 A:middle
How do I do this?

00:07:56.846 --> 00:07:59.096 A:middle
By using Vision, I can use

00:07:59.096 --> 00:07:59.906 A:middle
Registration.
