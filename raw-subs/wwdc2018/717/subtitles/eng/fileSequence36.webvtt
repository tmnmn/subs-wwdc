00:35:57.576 --> 00:36:02.676 A:middle
Clicker. Here we go.

00:36:02.856 --> 00:36:03.086 A:middle
Alright.

00:36:03.646 --> 00:36:05.606 A:middle
Unfortunately, not all

00:36:05.606 --> 00:36:06.936 A:middle
algorithms will have the same

00:36:06.936 --> 00:36:08.736 A:middle
scale in terms of like how they

00:36:08.736 --> 00:36:10.156 A:middle
report their confidence scores.

00:36:10.316 --> 00:36:12.356 A:middle
For instance, if we look at our

00:36:12.356 --> 00:36:14.096 A:middle
text detector, it pretty much

00:36:14.096 --> 00:36:15.336 A:middle
always returns a confidence

00:36:15.336 --> 00:36:17.256 A:middle
score of 1 because if it doesn't

00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:18.356 A:middle
think there's text, it's not

00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:19.476 A:middle
going to return the bounding box

00:36:19.476 --> 00:36:20.306 A:middle
in the first place.

00:36:21.296 --> 00:36:23.646 A:middle
But as we saw, the classifiers

00:36:23.856 --> 00:36:25.436 A:middle
have a very large range actually

00:36:25.506 --> 00:36:26.736 A:middle
of what this confidence score

00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:27.146 A:middle
could be.

00:36:27.646 --> 00:36:28.866 A:middle
Let's look at a few examples.

00:36:30.056 --> 00:36:33.356 A:middle
In my first example, I used an

00:36:33.356 --> 00:36:34.696 A:middle
image from our robot shop

00:36:34.696 --> 00:36:37.356 A:middle
example and I ran my own model

00:36:37.356 --> 00:36:37.606 A:middle
on it.

00:36:38.356 --> 00:36:40.076 A:middle
And sure enough, it had a very

00:36:40.076 --> 00:36:41.326 A:middle
high confidence, this is a

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:42.006 A:middle
stepper motor.

00:36:43.756 --> 00:36:45.996 A:middle
Now, on this next examples, I'm

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.296 A:middle
going to use some of the models

00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:48.326 A:middle
that we have in our model

00:36:48.326 --> 00:36:48.786 A:middle
gallery.

00:36:49.836 --> 00:36:51.076 A:middle
So, don't get me wrong.

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:52.166 A:middle
I don't want to compare the

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.296 A:middle
quality of the models.

00:36:53.296 --> 00:36:54.406 A:middle
It's about like actually what

00:36:54.406 --> 00:36:56.126 A:middle
did confidence they return and

00:36:56.126 --> 00:36:57.106 A:middle
what actually want to do with

00:36:57.196 --> 00:36:57.436 A:middle
this.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:36:59.836 A:middle
So, what did this tell us

00:36:59.836 --> 00:37:00.966 A:middle
basically when we want to
