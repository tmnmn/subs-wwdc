00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:01.186 A:middle
Request, to compare against the

00:24:01.186 --> 00:24:02.026 A:middle
previous frame.

00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:04.916 A:middle
Out of that, we get our

00:24:04.916 --> 00:24:07.406 A:middle
translation as of terms of an

00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:08.826 A:middle
alignment transform which tells

00:24:08.826 --> 00:24:10.296 A:middle
me the X and Y of like how the

00:24:10.296 --> 00:24:13.116 A:middle
previous frame has shifted to

00:24:13.116 --> 00:24:13.966 A:middle
[inaudible] the current one.

00:24:15.986 --> 00:24:17.126 A:middle
Then we talked about that we

00:24:17.126 --> 00:24:18.596 A:middle
want to only analyze the scene

00:24:18.596 --> 00:24:19.326 A:middle
when it's stable.

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:22.896 A:middle
And for that, we created our VN

00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:24.156 A:middle
Image Request Handler off the

00:24:24.156 --> 00:24:24.986 A:middle
current buffer.

00:24:25.396 --> 00:24:28.116 A:middle
And we passed in together both

00:24:28.116 --> 00:24:30.636 A:middle
the barcode detection and the

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:31.586 A:middle
classification.

00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:34.086 A:middle
So, that allows Vision to do its

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:35.956 A:middle
optimization underneath the

00:24:35.956 --> 00:24:37.936 A:middle
covers and can actually perform

00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:39.056 A:middle
much faster than if you would

00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:40.536 A:middle
run them as separate requests.

00:24:41.006 --> 00:24:44.606 A:middle
Next was the part about thinking

00:24:44.606 --> 00:24:46.636 A:middle
about how many buffers do I hold

00:24:46.636 --> 00:24:47.166 A:middle
in flight?

00:24:47.636 --> 00:24:48.976 A:middle
And that's why I say manage your

00:24:48.976 --> 00:24:49.436 A:middle
buffers.

00:24:50.966 --> 00:24:52.396 A:middle
Some Vision requests, like these

00:24:52.816 --> 00:24:54.696 A:middle
convolutional networks, can take

00:24:54.696 --> 00:24:55.316 A:middle
a bit longer.

00:24:55.966 --> 00:24:57.396 A:middle
And these longer running tasks

00:24:57.396 --> 00:24:59.016 A:middle
are better to perform on a

00:24:59.016 --> 00:25:01.216 A:middle
background queue, so that
