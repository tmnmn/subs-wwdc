00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:00.346 A:middle
So, we made this possible

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:02.826 A:middle
through a new API and that is

00:31:02.826 --> 00:31:04.376 A:middle
our VN Recognized Object

00:31:04.376 --> 00:31:04.986 A:middle
Observation.

00:31:06.486 --> 00:31:08.896 A:middle
It comes automatically when we

00:31:08.986 --> 00:31:11.336 A:middle
perform a Core ML model request,

00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:13.776 A:middle
and if that model is actually

00:31:13.776 --> 00:31:16.586 A:middle
using an object detector as a

00:31:16.586 --> 00:31:17.086 A:middle
space.

00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:22.486 A:middle
Like in this example, it is

00:31:22.486 --> 00:31:23.786 A:middle
based on the YOLO based models.

00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:25.236 A:middle
Now, you might say, "Well, I

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:26.896 A:middle
could have already run YOLO like

00:31:26.896 --> 00:31:27.306 A:middle
last year.

00:31:27.306 --> 00:31:28.376 A:middle
There were a bunch of articles

00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:29.106 A:middle
that I saw on the web."

00:31:29.896 --> 00:31:31.206 A:middle
But look at how much code they

00:31:31.206 --> 00:31:33.056 A:middle
actually had to write to take

00:31:33.056 --> 00:31:34.776 A:middle
the output of this model, to

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:35.936 A:middle
then put it into something that

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:36.526 A:middle
you can use.

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.086 A:middle
And here, we only had a few

00:31:38.086 --> 00:31:38.696 A:middle
lines of code.

00:31:38.816 --> 00:31:40.346 A:middle
So, it makes YOLO models really,

00:31:40.346 --> 00:31:41.256 A:middle
really easy to use now.

00:31:41.256 --> 00:31:43.336 A:middle
Let's go once more over this in

00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:43.746 A:middle
the code.

00:31:44.316 --> 00:31:45.536 A:middle
So, I create my model.

00:31:46.336 --> 00:31:47.426 A:middle
From the model, I create my

00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:48.006 A:middle
request.

00:31:48.986 --> 00:31:51.196 A:middle
And in my completion handler, I

00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:52.606 A:middle
can simply look at the area of

00:31:52.606 --> 00:31:54.066 A:middle
objects, because we saw we can

00:31:54.066 --> 00:31:55.366 A:middle
get multiple objects back.

00:31:55.996 --> 00:31:57.396 A:middle
I get my labels from that, my

00:31:57.396 --> 00:31:59.546 A:middle
bounding box, and I can show my

00:31:59.546 --> 00:32:00.286 A:middle
Breakfast Finder.
