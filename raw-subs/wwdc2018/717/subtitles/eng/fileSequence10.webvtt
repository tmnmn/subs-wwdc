00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.716 A:middle
robot shop application.

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:02.826 A:middle
And when you see I'm moving

00:10:02.826 --> 00:10:03.876 A:middle
around, there's nothing

00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:04.406 A:middle
happening.

00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.626 A:middle
When I hold still, and I point

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:08.246 A:middle
it at something, I should see a

00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:10.246 A:middle
yellow line and then voila, yes

00:10:10.306 --> 00:10:11.366 A:middle
step is a stepper motor.

00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:13.336 A:middle
Okay? Let's see what else do we

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:14.316 A:middle
have here on this table?

00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:19.916 A:middle
That is my micro controller.

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:24.846 A:middle
That's a stepper motor driver.

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:26.196 A:middle
We can also like you know, pick

00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:27.486 A:middle
something up and hold it.

00:10:28.426 --> 00:10:31.266 A:middle
Yes, this is a closed loop belt.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:36.496 A:middle
What do we have here?

00:10:36.496 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
Lead screw.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:39.446 A:middle
And as I said, you can also look

00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:42.076 A:middle
at the barcode here, if I get my

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.086 A:middle
cable [inaudible] long enough.

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:47.846 A:middle
And that is my training course.

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:48.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, Frank?

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:51.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Of course, for that I

00:10:51.426 --> 00:10:51.626 A:middle
didn't--

00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:51.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Frank?

00:10:52.066 --> 00:10:56.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What's going on?

00:10:56.226 --> 00:10:57.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Frank, yes, I'm going to need

00:10:57.706 --> 00:10:59.286 A:middle
you to add another robot part to

00:10:59.286 --> 00:10:59.876 A:middle
your demo.
