00:36:59.836 --> 00:37:00.966 A:middle
basically when we want to

00:37:01.016 --> 00:37:02.536 A:middle
classify this image?

00:37:03.176 --> 00:37:05.916 A:middle
Well, it's not that bad, but

00:37:06.046 --> 00:37:07.376 A:middle
it's really sure about it

00:37:07.376 --> 00:37:07.646 A:middle
either.

00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:11.116 A:middle
The confidence score of 0.395 is

00:37:11.116 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
not particularly high, but yes,

00:37:12.696 --> 00:37:14.076 A:middle
it has a sand part, there's some

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:14.806 A:middle
beach involved.

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:18.336 A:middle
So, that's usable basically as a

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:19.616 A:middle
result when I want to search for

00:37:19.616 --> 00:37:21.006 A:middle
it, but might I label the image

00:37:21.046 --> 00:37:21.396 A:middle
with that?

00:37:21.586 --> 00:37:22.756 A:middle
It's probably questionable.

00:37:23.096 --> 00:37:25.536 A:middle
Let's look at this next example.

00:37:27.076 --> 00:37:27.886 A:middle
Girl on a scooter.

00:37:28.606 --> 00:37:29.716 A:middle
What did the classifier do with

00:37:29.766 --> 00:37:30.036 A:middle
this?

00:37:31.786 --> 00:37:32.766 A:middle
Well, I'm not sure she's so

00:37:32.766 --> 00:37:33.796 A:middle
happy to be called a sweet

00:37:33.796 --> 00:37:34.276 A:middle
potato.

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:40.916 A:middle
Let's look at one more example.

00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:42.716 A:middle
So, here's a screen shot of my

00:37:42.716 --> 00:37:43.066 A:middle
code.

00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:45.476 A:middle
What does the classifier do with

00:37:45.726 --> 00:37:46.966 A:middle
that?

00:37:47.366 --> 00:37:48.786 A:middle
It thinks it's a website.

00:37:48.936 --> 00:37:49.976 A:middle
Computers are so dumb.

00:37:53.626 --> 00:37:55.376 A:middle
So, some conclusions about our

00:37:55.376 --> 00:37:56.186 A:middle
confidence scores.

00:37:58.306 --> 00:38:00.626 A:middle
Does 1.0 always mean it's a 100%
