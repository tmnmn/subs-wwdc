00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
Okay, I'm bringing up my image

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:02.656 A:middle
capture application and let me

00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:06.016 A:middle
for a moment just hide my

00:13:06.016 --> 00:13:06.083 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:13:09.196 --> 00:13:10.976 A:middle
If I now look in my Finder, you

00:13:10.976 --> 00:13:12.036 A:middle
can actually see I have my

00:13:12.036 --> 00:13:13.496 A:middle
training set, which I used

00:13:13.496 --> 00:13:14.846 A:middle
already earlier to train and

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:16.276 A:middle
model that I've been using in my

00:13:16.276 --> 00:13:16.976 A:middle
application.

00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:18.936 A:middle
And I need to create now a new

00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:23.346 A:middle
folder, and let's call that

00:13:25.516 --> 00:13:25.686 A:middle
Servo.

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:27.186 A:middle
And from Image Capture, I can

00:13:27.186 --> 00:13:29.616 A:middle
now simply take all the pictures

00:13:29.616 --> 00:13:35.156 A:middle
that I just captured and drag

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:40.996 A:middle
them into my Servo.

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:43.596 A:middle
Alright, so now we have that

00:13:43.596 --> 00:13:44.016 A:middle
added.

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:45.836 A:middle
Now, I need to train my model

00:13:45.836 --> 00:13:48.716 A:middle
again since my manager just

00:13:48.716 --> 00:13:49.856 A:middle
ruined what I've done earlier.

00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:50.936 A:middle
Okay.

00:13:52.296 --> 00:13:53.956 A:middle
I used a simple scripting

00:13:53.956 --> 00:13:55.136 A:middle
playground here.

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:57.216 A:middle
Not the UI, just because well,

00:13:57.596 --> 00:13:58.616 A:middle
this might be something I want

00:13:58.616 --> 00:13:59.666 A:middle
to later on incorporate as a

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.406 A:middle
build step into my application.
