00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:00.316 A:middle
Now, how about Vision?

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:03.116 A:middle
It's less than a megabyte in

00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:03.726 A:middle
most cases.

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:07.506 A:middle
The other thing of course why we

00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:08.406 A:middle
believe that this is a good

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:10.586 A:middle
choice for use, it's already

00:06:10.586 --> 00:06:11.276 A:middle
optimized.

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:13.116 A:middle
And we know a few things about

00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:15.546 A:middle
our hardware or GPUs and CPUS

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:18.746 A:middle
and we really optimized a lot on

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.026 A:middle
that model so that it performs

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:21.296 A:middle
best on our devices.

00:06:21.906 --> 00:06:25.246 A:middle
So, how do we train [inaudible]?

00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:28.206 A:middle
We start with some labeled

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:30.106 A:middle
images, and bring them into

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:32.566 A:middle
Create ML, and Create ML knows

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:33.876 A:middle
how to extract [inaudible]

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:35.216 A:middle
Vision Feature Print.

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.776 A:middle
It trains our classifier and

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:40.506 A:middle
that classifier is all what

00:06:40.506 --> 00:06:41.616 A:middle
[inaudible] will go into our

00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:42.386 A:middle
Core ML model.

00:06:42.546 --> 00:06:43.786 A:middle
That's why it is so small.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:46.136 A:middle
Now, when it comes time that I

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
actually want to analyze an

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:50.416 A:middle
image, all I have to do is use

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:53.336 A:middle
my image and model, and now in

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:56.036 A:middle
Vision or in Core ML, it knows

00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:57.166 A:middle
another [inaudible] again how to

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.276 A:middle
train -- sorry.

00:06:58.426 --> 00:06:59.036 A:middle
Not train.

00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:00.936 A:middle
In this case, use our Vision
