00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:02.276 A:middle
Let's start with our training.

00:02:03.426 --> 00:02:04.216 A:middle
So, how do we train?

00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:05.446 A:middle
We use of course, Create ML.

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:08.235 A:middle
The first step of course we have

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:09.596 A:middle
to do, is we have to take

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.036 A:middle
pictures.

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:13.816 A:middle
Then we put them in folders and

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:15.426 A:middle
we use the folder names as our

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:16.616 A:middle
classification labels.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:20.586 A:middle
Now, the biggest question that

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:22.256 A:middle
everybody has, "How much data do

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:22.576 A:middle
I need?"

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:25.646 A:middle
The first thing is, well, we

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.126 A:middle
need a minimum of about 10

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:31.456 A:middle
images per category, but that's

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:32.266 A:middle
on the low side.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.026 A:middle
You definitely want to have

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:33.426 A:middle
more.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:34.846 A:middle
The more, the better, actually

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:36.306 A:middle
your classifier will perform

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:36.546 A:middle
better.

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:39.966 A:middle
Another thing to look out for is

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.586 A:middle
highly imbalanced data sets.

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:42.546 A:middle
What do I mean by that?

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:44.196 A:middle
When a data set has like

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.656 A:middle
thousands of images in one

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:46.976 A:middle
category, and only ten in the

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:48.776 A:middle
other one, this model will not

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:49.586 A:middle
train really well.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.746 A:middle
So, you want to have like an

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:52.626 A:middle
equal distribution between most

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:53.366 A:middle
of your categories.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:57.496 A:middle
Another thing that we actually

00:02:57.756 --> 00:02:59.356 A:middle
introduce, is augmentation.
