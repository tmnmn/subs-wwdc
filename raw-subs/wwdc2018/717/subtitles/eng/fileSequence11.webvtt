00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:00.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This is Brett.

00:11:00.746 --> 00:11:01.546 A:middle
That's my manager.

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:05.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That'd be great.

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:10.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As usual, management, last

00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:12.016 A:middle
minute requests.

00:11:12.236 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'll make sure you get

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:14.126 A:middle
another copy of that memo.

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:16.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to come in on

00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:17.366 A:middle
Saturday for this.

00:11:18.296 --> 00:11:19.296 A:middle
Alright, well what do we have

00:11:19.356 --> 00:11:19.496 A:middle
here?

00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:20.876 A:middle
We have a [inaudible] motor.

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:23.016 A:middle
Alright, let's see.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:23.876 A:middle
It might just work.

00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:26.606 A:middle
Let me try this.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.156 A:middle
Do I get away with that?

00:11:29.396 --> 00:11:31.976 A:middle
No, it can't really read this

00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:32.416 A:middle
object.

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:33.156 A:middle
Perhaps so?

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:34.856 A:middle
It's -- no, it's not a stepper

00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:35.206 A:middle
motor.

00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:36.576 A:middle
So, that's a bug.

00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:39.086 A:middle
I guess we need to fix that.

00:11:39.896 --> 00:11:40.836 A:middle
Who wants to fix this?

00:11:41.786 --> 00:11:46.176 A:middle
Who wants to fix this?

00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:47.256 A:middle
Alright.

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:51.486 A:middle
So, what I have to do now is I

00:11:51.486 --> 00:11:52.656 A:middle
have to take some pictures of

00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:54.006 A:middle
the aforementioned, [inaudible]

00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:54.856 A:middle
motor.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:57.206 A:middle
So, I need to go to the studio

00:11:57.206 --> 00:11:59.276 A:middle
and you know, set up the lights,

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:03.086 A:middle
or I use my favorite camera that
