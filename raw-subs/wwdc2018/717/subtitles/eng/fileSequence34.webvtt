00:33:57.906 --> 00:34:00.096 A:middle
and if you pass an URL into

00:34:00.096 --> 00:34:03.176 A:middle
Vision as our input, Vision is

00:34:03.176 --> 00:34:04.306 A:middle
actually going to do all that

00:34:04.306 --> 00:34:05.446 A:middle
work basically for you and

00:34:05.446 --> 00:34:06.456 A:middle
actually read this EXIF

00:34:06.456 --> 00:34:07.786 A:middle
information from the file.

00:34:09.246 --> 00:34:10.746 A:middle
But like when -- as we showed in

00:34:10.746 --> 00:34:12.496 A:middle
the demos earlier, if I use my

00:34:12.496 --> 00:34:14.335 A:middle
live capture feed, I need to

00:34:14.335 --> 00:34:15.585 A:middle
actually pass this information

00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:15.775 A:middle
in.

00:34:16.335 --> 00:34:17.996 A:middle
So, I have to look at what does

00:34:17.996 --> 00:34:20.036 A:middle
my orientation from my UI device

00:34:20.096 --> 00:34:22.286 A:middle
current orientation and convert

00:34:22.286 --> 00:34:23.456 A:middle
this [inaudible] to CG Image

00:34:23.516 --> 00:34:24.666 A:middle
Property Orientation because we

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:26.126 A:middle
need it in the form of an EXIF

00:34:26.126 --> 00:34:26.755 A:middle
orientation.

00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:30.536 A:middle
Next, let's talk a little bit

00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:31.946 A:middle
about our coordinate system.

00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:35.295 A:middle
For Vision, the origin is always

00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:37.706 A:middle
in the lower, left corner.

00:34:37.806 --> 00:34:40.206 A:middle
And all processing is done in

00:34:40.206 --> 00:34:41.646 A:middle
the up right -- if the image

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.996 A:middle
would be in an upright position,

00:34:43.446 --> 00:34:44.585 A:middle
hence the orientation is

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:45.106 A:middle
important.

00:34:47.266 --> 00:34:48.576 A:middle
All our processing is really

00:34:48.576 --> 00:34:49.996 A:middle
done in a normalized coordinate

00:34:49.996 --> 00:34:52.266 A:middle
space, except the registration

00:34:52.266 --> 00:34:52.996 A:middle
where we actually need to know

00:34:52.996 --> 00:34:54.216 A:middle
how many pixels [inaudible].

00:34:54.896 --> 00:34:56.406 A:middle
So, normalized coordinates means

00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:58.166 A:middle
our coordinates go from zero,

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.306 A:middle
zero, to 1,1, in the upper right
