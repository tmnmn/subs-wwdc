This is a servo motor and let's

00:16:01.396 --> 00:16:06.606 A:middle
say this is a motor that goes

00:16:07.386 --> 00:16:10.286 A:middle
swish, swish.

00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:12.946 A:middle
Very technical.

00:16:13.296 --> 00:16:13.596 A:middle
Alright.

00:16:14.826 --> 00:16:15.726 A:middle
Let's see if this works.

00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:18.636 A:middle
I'm going to run my application

00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:19.496 A:middle
now.

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:28.776 A:middle
That's -- okay.

00:16:30.046 --> 00:16:32.136 A:middle
Let's try it.

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:33.956 A:middle
There's our servo motor.

00:16:34.516 --> 00:16:41.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:43.676 A:middle
Just to put this in perspective.

00:16:43.676 --> 00:16:44.956 A:middle
This was a world first that you

00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:45.356 A:middle
saw.

00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:47.066 A:middle
A classifier being trained live

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:48.516 A:middle
on stage, from photos, all the

00:16:48.516 --> 00:16:49.886 A:middle
way into the final application.

00:16:50.586 --> 00:16:51.896 A:middle
I was a bit sweating about this

00:16:51.896 --> 00:16:52.176 A:middle
demo [laughter].

00:16:55.686 --> 00:16:55.996 A:middle
Thank you.
