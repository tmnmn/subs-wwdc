00:29:58.776 --> 00:30:00.146 A:middle
over what parts of the package

00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.526 A:middle
get which setting values.

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:04.866 A:middle
Boris also talked to you earlier

00:30:04.866 --> 00:30:06.786 A:middle
about SwiftPM build isolation,

00:30:06.786 --> 00:30:08.026 A:middle
and why it's important.

00:30:09.206 --> 00:30:10.456 A:middle
We don't let you run arbitrary

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:11.206 A:middle
shell scripts.

00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:13.696 A:middle
But many users may want some

00:30:13.696 --> 00:30:14.906 A:middle
level of customization for their

00:30:14.906 --> 00:30:16.416 A:middle
build, either because they want

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:18.216 A:middle
to support custom languages, or

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.976 A:middle
processors, they want to run

00:30:19.976 --> 00:30:21.026 A:middle
their own documentation

00:30:21.026 --> 00:30:22.686 A:middle
generator implementor, or they

00:30:22.686 --> 00:30:24.166 A:middle
have other steps that they need

00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:25.826 A:middle
to bring to the build process.

00:30:26.776 --> 00:30:27.926 A:middle
We think that SwiftPM could

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.836 A:middle
support this safely, possibly

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:32.196 A:middle
even through real tools packages

00:30:32.196 --> 00:30:33.506 A:middle
that bring new tools into your

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:34.366 A:middle
build process.

00:30:34.956 --> 00:30:36.226 A:middle
The important thing we need to

00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:37.746 A:middle
make sure here, if we do such a

00:30:37.746 --> 00:30:39.706 A:middle
feature, is that any new tool

00:30:39.706 --> 00:30:40.716 A:middle
that's brought into the build

00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:42.306 A:middle
process have to correctly

00:30:42.306 --> 00:30:44.196 A:middle
declare their input and output

00:30:44.246 --> 00:30:46.166 A:middle
dependencies, so SwiftPM can

00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:48.286 A:middle
continue to maintain correct

00:30:48.366 --> 00:30:50.476 A:middle
incremental, and parallelizable

00:30:50.476 --> 00:30:50.946 A:middle
builds.

00:30:53.596 --> 00:30:54.876 A:middle
Finally, I want to talk a little

00:30:54.876 --> 00:30:56.446 A:middle
bit about some forward-looking

00:30:56.446 --> 00:30:58.306 A:middle
thoughts on package discovery,

00:30:58.556 --> 00:31:00.406 A:middle
trust, and management.
