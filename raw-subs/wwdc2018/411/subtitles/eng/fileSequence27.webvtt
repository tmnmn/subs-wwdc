SwiftPM to support this,

00:27:00.876 --> 00:27:03.196 A:middle
probably by using libSyntax.

00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:05.926 A:middle
libSyntax is a library being

00:27:05.926 --> 00:27:07.296 A:middle
developed in the Swift open

00:27:07.296 --> 00:27:08.856 A:middle
source project that makes it

00:27:08.856 --> 00:27:11.256 A:middle
easier for you to understand and

00:27:11.256 --> 00:27:13.536 A:middle
manipulate Swift syntax from

00:27:13.536 --> 00:27:14.336 A:middle
other tools.

00:27:15.476 --> 00:27:17.546 A:middle
Boris told you earlier that you

00:27:17.546 --> 00:27:19.556 A:middle
should prefer declarative syntax

00:27:19.636 --> 00:27:21.236 A:middle
for your package.swift manifest,

00:27:21.526 --> 00:27:22.986 A:middle
and this is another reason why.

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:25.006 A:middle
That will make it much easier

00:27:25.006 --> 00:27:26.526 A:middle
for SwiftPM to understand your

00:27:26.526 --> 00:27:28.076 A:middle
manifest, so that it can make

00:27:28.076 --> 00:27:29.706 A:middle
automatic changes, such as

00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:31.106 A:middle
adding new dependencies or

00:27:31.106 --> 00:27:32.486 A:middle
targets as shown here.

00:27:32.996 --> 00:27:36.286 A:middle
So, there's a lot of room for

00:27:36.286 --> 00:27:37.906 A:middle
SwiftPM also to add new

00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:39.016 A:middle
functionality to help you

00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:40.176 A:middle
publish new versions of your

00:27:40.176 --> 00:27:41.876 A:middle
packages and deploy their

00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:42.596 A:middle
products.

00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:45.776 A:middle
Today, when you want to publish

00:27:45.776 --> 00:27:46.996 A:middle
a new version of your package,

00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:49.056 A:middle
you tag it manually with git.

00:27:49.056 --> 00:27:51.286 A:middle
And if you want to inspect your

00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:52.976 A:middle
published tags, you use git

00:27:52.976 --> 00:27:54.096 A:middle
directly for that as well.

00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:56.986 A:middle
We could add new functionality

00:27:57.146 --> 00:27:58.956 A:middle
to automate this process and

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:00.786 A:middle
perform additional housekeeping,
