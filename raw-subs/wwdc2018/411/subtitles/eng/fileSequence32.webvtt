00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.346 A:middle
either because they want to make

00:32:00.346 --> 00:32:02.086 A:middle
a private customization to one

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.456 A:middle
of the packages in their graph.

00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:05.416 A:middle
Or, even because they just want

00:32:05.416 --> 00:32:08.006 A:middle
to override the origin URL of

00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:09.016 A:middle
where they're getting each of

00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:10.406 A:middle
those packages from, so that

00:32:10.406 --> 00:32:12.516 A:middle
they can point at a private

00:32:12.516 --> 00:32:14.846 A:middle
mirror that they control and not

00:32:14.876 --> 00:32:16.616 A:middle
depend on the original package

00:32:16.676 --> 00:32:20.116 A:middle
always being there.

00:32:20.286 --> 00:32:21.636 A:middle
Ultimately, I'd like some day

00:32:21.636 --> 00:32:23.096 A:middle
for us to have a real index for

00:32:23.096 --> 00:32:23.966 A:middle
Swift packages.

00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:25.846 A:middle
In addition to providing a

00:32:25.846 --> 00:32:27.936 A:middle
standardized namespace and

00:32:27.936 --> 00:32:29.476 A:middle
making it easier to discover new

00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:31.696 A:middle
packages, we could even support

00:32:31.696 --> 00:32:33.926 A:middle
things like quality metrics for

00:32:33.926 --> 00:32:34.416 A:middle
a package.

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.656 A:middle
Like what is its automated test

00:32:35.656 --> 00:32:36.146 A:middle
coverage?

00:32:36.636 --> 00:32:38.466 A:middle
Or ways for you to evaluate the

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:40.246 A:middle
trustworthiness of a new package

00:32:40.246 --> 00:32:40.966 A:middle
that you're considering

00:32:40.966 --> 00:32:41.476 A:middle
adopting.

00:32:41.976 --> 00:32:45.106 A:middle
So, I've gone over a lot here.

00:32:45.306 --> 00:32:46.296 A:middle
But these are just some of the

00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:47.236 A:middle
possibilities.

00:32:47.616 --> 00:32:49.256 A:middle
Ultimately for those of you, who

00:32:49.256 --> 00:32:51.066 A:middle
are interested, we're interested

00:32:51.066 --> 00:32:52.846 A:middle
in your feedback, ideas, and

00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:54.606 A:middle
contributions to help make Swift

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:56.126 A:middle
Package Manager the best tool

00:32:56.126 --> 00:32:57.236 A:middle
that it can be for the developer

00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:57.756 A:middle
community.

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:00.726 A:middle
So, to talk about how you can do
