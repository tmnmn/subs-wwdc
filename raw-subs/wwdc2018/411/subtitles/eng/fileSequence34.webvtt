00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:00.656 A:middle
And since, as I said, SwiftPM is

00:34:00.656 --> 00:34:02.226 A:middle
written in Swift, you may find

00:34:02.436 --> 00:34:03.606 A:middle
it's actually pretty easy to

00:34:03.606 --> 00:34:04.886 A:middle
dive in and take a look.

00:34:05.346 --> 00:34:07.836 A:middle
Of course, if you find bugs when

00:34:07.836 --> 00:34:09.306 A:middle
you're using SwiftPM, we

00:34:09.306 --> 00:34:10.746 A:middle
encourage you to go file them on

00:34:10.746 --> 00:34:12.525 A:middle
bugs.swift.org as well, where

00:34:12.525 --> 00:34:14.396 A:middle
you can track how we handle

00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:16.556 A:middle
them.

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:18.166 A:middle
SwiftPM gets to take advantage

00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.656 A:middle
of the same great continuous

00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:20.926 A:middle
integration infrastructure that

00:34:20.926 --> 00:34:21.956 A:middle
the Swift project has.

00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:23.516 A:middle
Which means that poll requests

00:34:23.516 --> 00:34:25.126 A:middle
can be automatically built and

00:34:25.126 --> 00:34:26.646 A:middle
had their tests run before their

00:34:26.646 --> 00:34:27.116 A:middle
merged.

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:29.206 A:middle
Because the SwiftPM code base

00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:30.815 A:middle
itself has great test coverage,

00:34:31.116 --> 00:34:31.775 A:middle
we found that this

00:34:31.775 --> 00:34:33.206 A:middle
infrastructure is really useful

00:34:33.206 --> 00:34:33.755 A:middle
for us.

00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:36.806 A:middle
When you're ready to try out the

00:34:36.806 --> 00:34:38.686 A:middle
latest changes, you can download

00:34:38.686 --> 00:34:40.436 A:middle
the Trunk Snapshot Toolchains

00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:41.775 A:middle
that are updated on a regular

00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:44.156 A:middle
basis available on Swift.org.

00:34:46.456 --> 00:34:47.866 A:middle
We've been really happy with the

00:34:47.866 --> 00:34:49.306 A:middle
growth of the SwiftPM community

00:34:49.306 --> 00:34:49.746 A:middle
so far.

00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:51.876 A:middle
We've had over 180 people

00:34:51.876 --> 00:34:53.626 A:middle
contribute, either with bug

00:34:53.626 --> 00:34:55.146 A:middle
features or new features.

00:34:55.636 --> 00:34:57.276 A:middle
And the Swift Package ecosystem

00:34:57.276 --> 00:34:58.446 A:middle
is growing at a healthy rate as

00:34:58.446 --> 00:35:00.216 A:middle
well, often with cross-platform
