00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:00.786 A:middle
perform additional housekeeping,

00:28:00.786 --> 00:28:02.676 A:middle
validation, and other auxiliary

00:28:02.676 --> 00:28:04.466 A:middle
tasks you might want as part of

00:28:04.466 --> 00:28:05.506 A:middle
a streamlined publishing

00:28:05.506 --> 00:28:06.046 A:middle
workflow.

00:28:07.796 --> 00:28:09.726 A:middle
One especially useful feature we

00:28:09.726 --> 00:28:11.206 A:middle
could add here would be

00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:12.686 A:middle
assistance with maintaining

00:28:12.686 --> 00:28:14.056 A:middle
correct semantic versioning.

00:28:14.696 --> 00:28:17.176 A:middle
We could have SwiftPM analyze

00:28:17.176 --> 00:28:18.776 A:middle
the API differences in the new

00:28:18.776 --> 00:28:20.226 A:middle
version of your package and

00:28:20.226 --> 00:28:21.736 A:middle
detect when you've made a change

00:28:21.886 --> 00:28:22.976 A:middle
that is not compatible at

00:28:22.976 --> 00:28:24.656 A:middle
compile time, so that it can

00:28:24.656 --> 00:28:26.186 A:middle
suggest updating the major

00:28:26.186 --> 00:28:27.726 A:middle
version of your package.

00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:32.326 A:middle
Another thing we could do is

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:34.286 A:middle
make it easier to deploy the

00:28:34.286 --> 00:28:36.156 A:middle
products of your packages from

00:28:36.156 --> 00:28:36.516 A:middle
SwiftPM.

00:28:36.516 --> 00:28:39.606 A:middle
You may want to customize the

00:28:39.606 --> 00:28:41.636 A:middle
linkage with libraries, or the

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:43.586 A:middle
product layout for your specific

00:28:43.626 --> 00:28:45.086 A:middle
deployment environment, whether

00:28:45.086 --> 00:28:46.526 A:middle
local or on a server.

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.886 A:middle
Or, maybe you want to include

00:28:48.886 --> 00:28:50.696 A:middle
version information about what

00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:52.516 A:middle
packages were built into the

00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:53.006 A:middle
product.

00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:55.736 A:middle
Or, you otherwise want to use

00:28:55.736 --> 00:28:57.316 A:middle
the context that SwiftPM has

00:28:57.366 --> 00:28:59.226 A:middle
about your packages somewhere in

00:28:59.226 --> 00:28:59.816 A:middle
your product.
