00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:00.796 A:middle
versions of these direct

00:18:00.796 --> 00:18:01.456 A:middle
dependencies.

00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:03.666 A:middle
For the first one, this is

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.086 A:middle
straightforward because we

00:18:05.086 --> 00:18:06.536 A:middle
specified an exact version,

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.336 A:middle
beginning exactly that tag.

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:11.886 A:middle
For the second one, we're using

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
the from syntax.

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:14.986 A:middle
That means we're getting updates

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:17.106 A:middle
to the minor or patch

00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:17.826 A:middle
components.

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:21.766 A:middle
In this case, we're ending up

00:18:21.896 --> 00:18:24.046 A:middle
with a tag 3.1.4.

00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:28.566 A:middle
The whole process is recursive.

00:18:29.206 --> 00:18:30.876 A:middle
So next SwiftPM will look at the

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:32.546 A:middle
transitive dependencies of all

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:33.296 A:middle
diary points.

00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:34.716 A:middle
So, PM has no further

00:18:34.716 --> 00:18:36.656 A:middle
dependencies, so there's nothing

00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:37.146 A:middle
to do there.

00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:39.686 A:middle
But a deck of playing cards

00:18:39.796 --> 00:18:41.236 A:middle
depends on the Fisher-Yates and

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:42.346 A:middle
playing card packages.

00:18:42.916 --> 00:18:47.426 A:middle
Next, SwiftPM has to resolve the

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:48.776 A:middle
versions of these packages

00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:49.176 A:middle
again.

00:18:49.576 --> 00:18:50.976 A:middle
For the Fisher-Yates package,

00:18:51.066 --> 00:18:52.966 A:middle
this works the same way as

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.546 A:middle
before because we are also using

00:18:54.546 --> 00:18:55.576 A:middle
the from syntax.

00:18:56.666 --> 00:18:57.906 A:middle
In this case, we're ending up

00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:59.626 A:middle
with a tag, 2.2.5.
