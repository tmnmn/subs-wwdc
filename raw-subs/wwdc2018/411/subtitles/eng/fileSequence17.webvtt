00:16:58.456 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
new method or type.

00:17:00.996 --> 00:17:02.896 A:middle
And finally, the patch version

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.465 A:middle
should be increased when you're

00:17:04.465 --> 00:17:06.165 A:middle
making backwards compatible bug

00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:06.736 A:middle
fixes.

00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:10.776 A:middle
This allows clients to benefit

00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:13.536 A:middle
from bug fixes without risking

00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:17.695 A:middle
breaking the source code.

00:17:17.816 --> 00:17:19.536 A:middle
SwiftPM needs to determine the

00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:21.296 A:middle
exact versions of all packages

00:17:21.296 --> 00:17:23.246 A:middle
in the package graph before it

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:24.056 A:middle
is ready to build.

00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:26.526 A:middle
We do this with a process called

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:27.756 A:middle
dependency resolution.

00:17:28.716 --> 00:17:30.796 A:middle
As part of this, SwiftPM looks

00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:32.376 A:middle
at all the requirements

00:17:33.456 --> 00:17:36.206 A:middle
specified for packages and finds

00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:37.516 A:middle
the latest version that is

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:40.146 A:middle
compatible with all of them.

00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:41.396 A:middle
Let's take a closer look at what

00:17:41.396 --> 00:17:42.926 A:middle
SwiftPM is doing in the process

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:44.836 A:middle
using the demo I showed you

00:17:44.836 --> 00:17:45.306 A:middle
before.

00:17:47.136 --> 00:17:49.676 A:middle
The dealer package from the demo

00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:51.066 A:middle
has two direct dependencies.

00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:53.796 A:middle
One, is SwiftPM itself, and the

00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:55.206 A:middle
other one is deck of playing

00:17:57.956 --> 00:17:58.136 A:middle
cards.

00:17:58.276 --> 00:17:59.666 A:middle
SwiftPM will resolve the

00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:00.796 A:middle
versions of these direct
