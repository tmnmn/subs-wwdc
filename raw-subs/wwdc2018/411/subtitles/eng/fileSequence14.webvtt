00:14:00.316 --> 00:14:01.836 A:middle
On the left-hand side here, you

00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:03.846 A:middle
see an example that is not

00:14:03.846 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
really declarative.

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:06.886 A:middle
We cannot see the name that is

00:14:06.886 --> 00:14:09.656 A:middle
being generated and it's used in

00:14:09.656 --> 00:14:10.956 A:middle
a couple of times across the

00:14:10.956 --> 00:14:11.526 A:middle
package.

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:14.726 A:middle
In contrast, on the right-hand

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:15.736 A:middle
side, we have a fully

00:14:15.736 --> 00:14:17.486 A:middle
declarative manifest by using

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:18.406 A:middle
string constants.

00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:20.356 A:middle
It is easy to understand and see

00:14:20.746 --> 00:14:21.726 A:middle
what the targets are.

00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:25.526 A:middle
So, as you can see, not using

00:14:25.526 --> 00:14:27.086 A:middle
declarative syntax also makes

00:14:27.086 --> 00:14:28.056 A:middle
your manifest harder to

00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:29.596 A:middle
understand for you and your

00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:29.976 A:middle
users.

00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:35.226 A:middle
Source files organized on disks

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:36.786 A:middle
in folders named after each

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:38.806 A:middle
target in the package.

00:14:39.426 --> 00:14:40.846 A:middle
This makes it easy to get

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:43.216 A:middle
started and allows packages to

00:14:43.246 --> 00:14:46.336 A:middle
adopt a common structure, so

00:14:46.516 --> 00:14:47.466 A:middle
that you can navigate them

00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:47.796 A:middle
quickly.

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.496 A:middle
Package Managers and other build

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:54.506 A:middle
tools often have attention

00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:56.696 A:middle
between what is explicitly

00:14:56.696 --> 00:14:58.636 A:middle
configured by the user and the

00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.256 A:middle
conventions that are imposed by
