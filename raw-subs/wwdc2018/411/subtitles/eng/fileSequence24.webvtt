00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:00.546 A:middle
your packages' source code.

00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:05.546 A:middle
To specify which version of the

00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:08.006 A:middle
API is being used, we're using

00:24:08.006 --> 00:24:09.476 A:middle
the Swift Tools Version command

00:24:10.526 --> 00:24:12.036 A:middle
at the top of the package.swift

00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:12.846 A:middle
manifest file.

00:24:13.446 --> 00:24:15.306 A:middle
This specifies the minimum

00:24:15.306 --> 00:24:16.476 A:middle
required version of the Swift

00:24:16.476 --> 00:24:19.266 A:middle
tools that is needed to process

00:24:19.266 --> 00:24:20.226 A:middle
the given manifest.

00:24:20.686 --> 00:24:24.056 A:middle
Each package can also declare

00:24:24.176 --> 00:24:25.356 A:middle
which versions of the Swift

00:24:25.356 --> 00:24:27.936 A:middle
language it uses for compiling

00:24:27.936 --> 00:24:28.646 A:middle
its source code.

00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:31.186 A:middle
This is a list, so you can

00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:32.436 A:middle
choose to support multiple

00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:34.216 A:middle
versions of Swift with the same

00:24:34.216 --> 00:24:35.566 A:middle
version of your package, by

00:24:35.566 --> 00:24:36.846 A:middle
using compiler directives.

00:24:37.816 --> 00:24:39.256 A:middle
A package graph can be a

00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:40.796 A:middle
mix-and-match of packages with

00:24:40.796 --> 00:24:41.826 A:middle
different language versions.

00:24:44.456 --> 00:24:45.866 A:middle
I told you a lot about how

00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:48.136 A:middle
SwiftPM works today, next I'd

00:24:48.136 --> 00:24:49.516 A:middle
like to invite Rick back up to

00:24:49.516 --> 00:24:51.746 A:middle
the stage to tell you where we

00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:52.476 A:middle
can go from here.

00:24:53.516 --> 00:24:58.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:59.126 --> 00:24:59.946 A:middle
