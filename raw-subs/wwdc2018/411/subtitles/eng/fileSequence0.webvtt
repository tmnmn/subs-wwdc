With me today is Boris Buegling.

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:35.946 A:middle

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:37.356 A:middle
you all about Swift's Package

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:38.926 A:middle
Manager, or as we call it

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:40.236 A:middle
sometimes SwiftPM.

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:43.156 A:middle
We're going to focus today on

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:44.516 A:middle

The Swift Package Manager makes

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:54.226 A:middle
it easier to develop and

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:55.926 A:middle
distribute source code in the

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:56.986 A:middle
Swift ecosystem.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:58.576 A:middle
Today we're going to talk about

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.946 A:middle
