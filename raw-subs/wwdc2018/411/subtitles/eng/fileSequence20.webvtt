00:19:59.086 --> 00:20:01.076 A:middle
your team, or your continuous

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.496 A:middle
integration infrastructure, so

00:20:03.496 --> 00:20:04.676 A:middle
that you get dependable build

00:20:04.676 --> 00:20:05.896 A:middle
results, and you can

00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:07.436 A:middle
deliberately choose when you

00:20:07.436 --> 00:20:10.976 A:middle
want to update a dependency.

00:20:11.046 --> 00:20:12.536 A:middle
You do so by running Swift

00:20:12.536 --> 00:20:13.716 A:middle
Package Update, when you're

00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:14.406 A:middle
ready to update.

00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:17.466 A:middle
Note also, that this is your

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.896 A:middle
top-level package that contains

00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:21.286 A:middle
package.resolved.

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
If one of the transitive

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:24.626 A:middle
dependencies contains a

00:20:24.626 --> 00:20:26.606 A:middle
package.resolve file, it will be

00:20:26.606 --> 00:20:27.876 A:middle
ignored for dependency

00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:28.506 A:middle
resolution.

00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:32.206 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at

00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:36.796 A:middle
building your package.

00:20:36.796 --> 00:20:38.446 A:middle
SwiftPM uses llbuild as its

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:39.846 A:middle
underlying build engine.

00:20:40.526 --> 00:20:42.146 A:middle
llbuild is a set of libraries

00:20:42.146 --> 00:20:43.156 A:middle
for building build systems.

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:45.146 A:middle
And it's built around a general

00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:47.176 A:middle
purpose and reusable build

00:20:47.176 --> 00:20:47.546 A:middle
engine.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.836 A:middle
This provides us with ability to

00:20:49.836 --> 00:20:51.396 A:middle
do fast as well as correct

00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:52.206 A:middle
incremental builds.

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:54.926 A:middle
And is also used by Xcode's new

00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:55.536 A:middle
build system.

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:59.606 A:middle
It is also the part of the Swift

00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:00.606 A:middle
open source project.
