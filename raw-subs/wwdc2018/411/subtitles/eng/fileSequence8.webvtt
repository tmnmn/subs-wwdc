00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:00.106 A:middle
packages, declared as

00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:00.776 A:middle
dependencies.

00:08:02.976 --> 00:08:04.656 A:middle
Products are executable to

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:08.396 A:middle
libraries and products are

00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:09.476 A:middle
assembled from the build

00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:11.506 A:middle
artifacts of one or more target.

00:08:13.996 --> 00:08:16.166 A:middle
Packages provide libraries for

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:18.426 A:middle
other packages by defining

00:08:18.426 --> 00:08:18.836 A:middle
products.

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:22.536 A:middle
By default, you do not have to

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:23.946 A:middle
declare the type of library

00:08:23.946 --> 00:08:26.726 A:middle
explicitly, but SwiftPM will

00:08:26.726 --> 00:08:28.906 A:middle
choose it for you based on its

00:08:28.906 --> 00:08:29.356 A:middle
use.

00:08:30.446 --> 00:08:32.346 A:middle
If needed, you can explicitly

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:34.586 A:middle
declare a library a static or

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:34.976 A:middle
dynamic.

00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:38.496 A:middle
Let's take a look how our

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:40.756 A:middle
targets are configured in the

00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:42.066 A:middle
manifest.

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:43.466 A:middle
In our example, we have three

00:08:43.466 --> 00:08:43.996 A:middle
targets.

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.866 A:middle
The first is called libdealer,

00:08:48.046 --> 00:08:49.186 A:middle
and it contains the

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:50.886 A:middle
implementation of our main

00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:51.646 A:middle
functionality.

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:53.906 A:middle
And it has one dependency, the

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:55.036 A:middle
deck of playing cards product

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:58.266 A:middle
which comes from the dependency

00:08:58.266 --> 00:08:59.096 A:middle
we declared earlier.
