00:09:00.896 --> 00:09:03.206 A:middle
Second target, dealer depends on

00:09:03.206 --> 00:09:04.946 A:middle
that to provide the command line

00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:06.536 A:middle
tool that we just run earlier.

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:10.756 A:middle
And finally, we also have a test

00:09:10.756 --> 00:09:12.126 A:middle
target that depends on the two

00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:13.696 A:middle
other targets and this is where

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:14.366 A:middle
we can unit test our

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:14.956 A:middle
functionality.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.436 A:middle
In our example package, we have

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.206 A:middle
also configured two products.

00:09:24.646 --> 00:09:26.676 A:middle
The first is a library product

00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:28.616 A:middle
corresponding to the libdealer

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
target.

00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:31.806 A:middle
And this provides our

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:33.736 A:middle
implementation as a library for

00:09:33.736 --> 00:09:34.746 A:middle
external consumption.

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:39.016 A:middle
Second, we have an executable

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:41.166 A:middle
target depending on the dealer

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:43.916 A:middle
target which provides an

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.526 A:middle
executable for command line use.

00:09:50.496 --> 00:09:52.686 A:middle
To complete this section, I will

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:53.886 A:middle
show you how we can use a

00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:55.596 A:middle
package to add a new feature to

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
the example.

00:09:59.836 --> 00:10:01.216 A:middle
This, we switch to a new
