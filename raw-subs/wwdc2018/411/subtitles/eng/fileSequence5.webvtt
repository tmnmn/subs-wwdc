00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:02.706 A:middle
Switch to that directory and we

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:06.656 A:middle
will run Swift Package init with

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.046 A:middle
the type executable.

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:12.166 A:middle
With this, SwiftPM creates a

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:13.716 A:middle
basic package and structure for

00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:14.006 A:middle
us.

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:18.306 A:middle
Let's open finder to look at it

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:19.556 A:middle
a little bit more closely.

00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:30.426 A:middle
We have the Package.swift

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:32.046 A:middle
manifest file, which describes

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:33.356 A:middle
the structure of the package.

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:34.656 A:middle
We get a basic README.

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:38.026 A:middle
You have the Sources directory

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:40.266 A:middle
with a subfolder for our

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:41.176 A:middle
helloworld target.

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:43.736 A:middle
And the main.swift file for our

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:44.306 A:middle
executable.

00:05:44.986 --> 00:05:46.286 A:middle
You also get a test directory,

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:47.946 A:middle
where we could later put some

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:48.476 A:middle
unit tests.

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:52.146 A:middle
Let's switch back to terminal.

00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:58.296 A:middle
And we will type swift run to

00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:00.126 A:middle
build and run this package.
