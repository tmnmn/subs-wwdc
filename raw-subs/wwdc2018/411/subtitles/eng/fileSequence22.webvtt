00:22:00.076 --> 00:22:01.386 A:middle
This is based on the XCTest

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:02.716 A:middle
framework that you're already

00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:03.306 A:middle
familiar with.

00:22:03.916 --> 00:22:07.136 A:middle
We support parallel testing, so

00:22:07.136 --> 00:22:08.026 A:middle
that you can get your test

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:08.876 A:middle
results faster.

00:22:10.036 --> 00:22:12.766 A:middle
And we support test filtering so

00:22:12.766 --> 00:22:13.856 A:middle
that you can run a subset of

00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:15.566 A:middle
tests and iterate on a single

00:22:15.566 --> 00:22:15.936 A:middle
feature.

00:22:16.496 --> 00:22:20.816 A:middle
As we're evolving SwiftPM, we're

00:22:20.816 --> 00:22:21.726 A:middle
thinking about workflow

00:22:21.726 --> 00:22:23.776 A:middle
features, especially so that you

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:25.116 A:middle
can do all of your development

00:22:25.116 --> 00:22:27.526 A:middle
on the command line.

00:22:27.716 --> 00:22:29.376 A:middle
One such feature is edit mode,

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:31.476 A:middle
which allows overwriting all

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:32.876 A:middle
transitive occurrences of a

00:22:32.876 --> 00:22:34.986 A:middle
specific package, with a locally

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:37.186 A:middle
checked out copy so that

00:22:37.386 --> 00:22:40.626 A:middle
temporary edits can be made, and

00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:41.766 A:middle
changes to transitive

00:22:41.766 --> 00:22:43.326 A:middle
dependencies can be tested

00:22:43.806 --> 00:22:44.996 A:middle
without having to forward all

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.836 A:middle
packages in the graph upfront.

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.396 A:middle
Branch dependencies allow

00:22:53.396 --> 00:22:54.826 A:middle
depending on packages without

00:22:54.826 --> 00:22:56.346 A:middle
strict versioning requirements.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.146 A:middle
This is useful when you're

00:22:58.146 --> 00:22:59.496 A:middle
developing multiple packages

00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:00.076 A:middle
together.
