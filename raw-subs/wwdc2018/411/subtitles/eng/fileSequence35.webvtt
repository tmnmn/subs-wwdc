00:34:58.446 --> 00:35:00.216 A:middle
well, often with cross-platform

00:35:00.216 --> 00:35:01.736 A:middle
packages, and many public

00:35:01.736 --> 00:35:03.236 A:middle
packages available on GitHub.

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:05.296 A:middle
What this means is that you can

00:35:05.296 --> 00:35:06.666 A:middle
focus on what makes your product

00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:08.406 A:middle
special and let package

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.086 A:middle
dependencies handle the rest.

00:35:10.086 --> 00:35:12.346 A:middle
There are a couple things that I

00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:13.966 A:middle
recommend you try SwiftPM out

00:35:14.116 --> 00:35:15.456 A:middle
for today, even though it has a

00:35:15.456 --> 00:35:16.326 A:middle
lot of room to grow in the

00:35:16.326 --> 00:35:16.766 A:middle
future.

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:19.126 A:middle
Those two things are command

00:35:19.126 --> 00:35:21.656 A:middle
line utilities and libraries and

00:35:21.656 --> 00:35:23.116 A:middle
for developing with Swift on the

00:35:23.116 --> 00:35:23.616 A:middle
server.

00:35:24.796 --> 00:35:26.216 A:middle
The server-side Swift community

00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:27.926 A:middle
has been making extensive use of

00:35:27.926 --> 00:35:29.156 A:middle
the Swift package manager.

00:35:29.626 --> 00:35:30.956 A:middle
And server-side Swift has been

00:35:30.956 --> 00:35:32.696 A:middle
growing well itself with many

00:35:32.696 --> 00:35:33.916 A:middle
frameworks now available for

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:35.116 A:middle
doing web and backend

00:35:35.116 --> 00:35:35.646 A:middle
development.

00:35:36.296 --> 00:35:37.886 A:middle
If you would like to take a look

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:39.006 A:middle
at this approach, I think you'll

00:35:39.006 --> 00:35:40.326 A:middle
find that Swift is a great

00:35:40.326 --> 00:35:41.426 A:middle
language to do this kind of

00:35:41.426 --> 00:35:42.736 A:middle
cross-platform development on.

00:35:44.076 --> 00:35:45.686 A:middle
But you could also go ahead and

00:35:45.686 --> 00:35:47.096 A:middle
use SwiftPM for creating

00:35:47.096 --> 00:35:48.366 A:middle
command-line utilities and

00:35:48.366 --> 00:35:50.116 A:middle
libraries today, whatever makes

00:35:50.116 --> 00:35:50.796 A:middle
sense for you.

00:35:51.386 --> 00:35:53.406 A:middle
Ultimately getting started is as

00:35:53.406 --> 00:35:54.856 A:middle
easy as opening a terminal

00:35:54.856 --> 00:35:56.656 A:middle
window and running Swift package

00:35:56.656 --> 00:35:57.006 A:middle
init.

00:35:57.776 --> 00:35:58.746 A:middle
So, the next time you're

00:35:58.746 --> 00:36:00.186 A:middle
thinking about trying something
