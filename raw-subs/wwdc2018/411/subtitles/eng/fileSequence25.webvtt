00:25:01.286 --> 00:25:02.416 A:middle
So, Boris has shown you what you

00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:04.856 A:middle
can do today, but there's a lot

00:25:04.856 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
more potential out there.

00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:08.426 A:middle
SwiftPM is still a young project

00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:09.716 A:middle
with lots of room to grow.

00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:13.396 A:middle
Swift uses an open evolution

00:25:13.396 --> 00:25:14.986 A:middle
process which means that anyone,

00:25:15.206 --> 00:25:17.116 A:middle
including you, can contribute

00:25:17.116 --> 00:25:17.956 A:middle
your ideas.

00:25:18.926 --> 00:25:19.796 A:middle
If you're looking for some

00:25:19.796 --> 00:25:21.596 A:middle
inspiration, we'd like to share

00:25:21.596 --> 00:25:23.736 A:middle
some of our ideas, but none of

00:25:23.736 --> 00:25:25.136 A:middle
this is a plan of record.

00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:27.086 A:middle
We're sharing these ideas so

00:25:27.086 --> 00:25:28.586 A:middle
that you can see the potential

00:25:28.586 --> 00:25:29.956 A:middle
of the Swift Package Manager.

00:25:30.276 --> 00:25:32.276 A:middle
And we welcome you to provide

00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:33.926 A:middle
your feedback, comments, and

00:25:33.926 --> 00:25:35.906 A:middle
your own ideas as we evolve is

00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:36.706 A:middle
this product.

00:25:38.216 --> 00:25:39.636 A:middle
The ideas I'm going to cover

00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:41.266 A:middle
today break down into four

00:25:41.266 --> 00:25:42.106 A:middle
different themes.

00:25:43.256 --> 00:25:44.396 A:middle
Letting the Swift Package

00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:45.806 A:middle
Manager integrate with other

00:25:45.806 --> 00:25:47.176 A:middle
tools that may want to sit on

00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:47.756 A:middle
top of it.

00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:50.366 A:middle
Helping you publish new versions

00:25:50.366 --> 00:25:52.136 A:middle
of your package and deploy their

00:25:52.136 --> 00:25:52.756 A:middle
products.

00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:55.806 A:middle
Supporting more complex packages

00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:57.136 A:middle
than SwiftPM is able to build

00:25:57.136 --> 00:25:57.606 A:middle
today.

00:25:57.606 --> 00:25:59.606 A:middle
And finally, some forward

00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:01.066 A:middle
looking thoughts on package
