00:29:00.516 --> 00:29:02.106 A:middle
SwiftPM could add new commands

00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:03.666 A:middle
to support all of these needs.

00:29:05.836 --> 00:29:07.196 A:middle
There's a lot that you can build

00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:09.266 A:middle
with SwiftPM today, but we also

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:10.736 A:middle
want to be able to support more

00:29:10.736 --> 00:29:12.276 A:middle
complex packages with more

00:29:12.276 --> 00:29:13.486 A:middle
sophisticated needs.

00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:16.356 A:middle
The biggest gap we have right

00:29:16.356 --> 00:29:17.906 A:middle
now, is probably support for

00:29:17.906 --> 00:29:18.646 A:middle
resources.

00:29:18.836 --> 00:29:20.836 A:middle
If you have any images, data

00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:22.726 A:middle
files, or other assets, SwiftPM

00:29:22.726 --> 00:29:24.386 A:middle
currently provides no way to

00:29:24.386 --> 00:29:25.426 A:middle
bundle these up you're your

00:29:25.426 --> 00:29:25.966 A:middle
products.

00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:28.626 A:middle
The foundation core library,

00:29:28.626 --> 00:29:30.716 A:middle
actually just added API this

00:29:30.716 --> 00:29:33.276 A:middle
spring for doing resources in a

00:29:33.276 --> 00:29:35.586 A:middle
cross-platform manner so SwiftPM

00:29:35.586 --> 00:29:37.316 A:middle
could adopt this API if we want

00:29:37.316 --> 00:29:38.046 A:middle
to build this feature.

00:29:39.896 --> 00:29:41.736 A:middle
We know that some users also

00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.496 A:middle
want support for specifying

00:29:43.496 --> 00:29:45.446 A:middle
compiler flags, linker flags,

00:29:45.746 --> 00:29:47.026 A:middle
and other properties that

00:29:47.026 --> 00:29:48.686 A:middle
SwiftPM doesn't support today.

00:29:48.796 --> 00:29:51.216 A:middle
It would be really great for us

00:29:51.216 --> 00:29:52.946 A:middle
to add a robust build settings

00:29:52.946 --> 00:29:55.136 A:middle
model, potentially including

00:29:55.136 --> 00:29:56.386 A:middle
things like conditional

00:29:56.386 --> 00:29:58.776 A:middle
settings, or fine-grain control

00:29:58.776 --> 00:30:00.146 A:middle
over what parts of the package
