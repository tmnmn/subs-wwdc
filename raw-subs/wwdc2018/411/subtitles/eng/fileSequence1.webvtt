00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.946 A:middle
its goals, some of its design,

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:02.396 A:middle
and a little bit about where we

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.876 A:middle
can go from here.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:06.836 A:middle
We'll start by telling you a

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:08.526 A:middle
little bit about why we decided

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.126 A:middle
to create a new Package Manager

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.586 A:middle
as part of the Swift project.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:13.486 A:middle
We'll show you little bit about

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:14.186 A:middle
how to use it.

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.276 A:middle
And then dive into its design

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
and features.

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:19.396 A:middle
We'll tell you a little bit

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:20.596 A:middle
about where we can go in the

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:22.706 A:middle
future and close out by

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
describing SwiftPM's open source

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.246 A:middle
process and how you can get

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:27.646 A:middle
involved if you're interested.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:30.186 A:middle
I'm sure most of you are

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:31.486 A:middle
familiar with package managers

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:33.506 A:middle
they're a great way to share and

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:34.276 A:middle
reuse code.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:36.146 A:middle
But why did we decide to create

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:37.946 A:middle
a new one for Swift?

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.356 A:middle
First of all, Swift is a

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:42.646 A:middle
cross-platform language.

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:43.836 A:middle
So we wanted a great

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.446 A:middle
cross-platform tool for building

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:46.096 A:middle
your Swift code.

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:48.376 A:middle
This makes it easy to configure

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:49.866 A:middle
your code in a consistent way

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.596 A:middle
and run it on all of Swift's

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:52.936 A:middle
supported platforms.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.386 A:middle
SwiftPM includes its own

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.166 A:middle
complete build system, allowing

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.856 A:middle
you to configure your software,

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:01.786 A:middle
build it, test it, and even run
