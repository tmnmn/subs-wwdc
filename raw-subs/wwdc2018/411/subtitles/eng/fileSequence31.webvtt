trust, and management.

00:31:00.906 --> 00:31:04.026 A:middle
Git itself supports, the

00:31:04.026 --> 00:31:05.226 A:middle
protocols that get supports,

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:07.116 A:middle
provides security mechanisms

00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:08.786 A:middle
like TLS to make sure that

00:31:08.786 --> 00:31:10.056 A:middle
you're actually talking to the

00:31:10.056 --> 00:31:11.446 A:middle
remote repository that you think

00:31:11.446 --> 00:31:11.826 A:middle
you are.

00:31:12.356 --> 00:31:14.036 A:middle
But a malicious actor could

00:31:14.036 --> 00:31:15.496 A:middle
still compromise remote

00:31:15.496 --> 00:31:17.296 A:middle
repository and put malicious

00:31:17.326 --> 00:31:18.876 A:middle
content in.

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:20.186 A:middle
This is actually something

00:31:20.186 --> 00:31:21.536 A:middle
anytime you're using third-party

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:22.996 A:middle
code, you should be aware of

00:31:22.996 --> 00:31:24.006 A:middle
these sorts of risks.

00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:25.706 A:middle
But the Swift Package Manager

00:31:25.856 --> 00:31:27.776 A:middle
provides a great opportunity for

00:31:27.776 --> 00:31:29.686 A:middle
us to build security features to

00:31:29.686 --> 00:31:30.996 A:middle
make sure that you're actually

00:31:30.996 --> 00:31:32.366 A:middle
getting the package content that

00:31:32.366 --> 00:31:33.016 A:middle
you expected.

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:37.546 A:middle
SwiftPM also prevents your

00:31:37.546 --> 00:31:39.026 A:middle
package.swift manifest

00:31:39.026 --> 00:31:41.206 A:middle
evaluation in your build from

00:31:41.206 --> 00:31:42.876 A:middle
escaping and writing things out

00:31:42.876 --> 00:31:44.266 A:middle
into your file system or

00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:45.316 A:middle
accessing the network.

00:31:45.756 --> 00:31:47.686 A:middle
We're using macOS' sandboxing

00:31:47.686 --> 00:31:49.066 A:middle
technology for this today.

00:31:49.066 --> 00:31:49.786 A:middle
And it's great.

00:31:50.096 --> 00:31:51.166 A:middle
But we'd like to bring this kind

00:31:51.166 --> 00:31:52.666 A:middle
of security to other platforms

00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:53.126 A:middle
as well.

00:31:55.596 --> 00:31:56.966 A:middle
Many users may want to be able

00:31:56.966 --> 00:31:58.566 A:middle
to fork their packages easily,

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.346 A:middle
either because they want to make
