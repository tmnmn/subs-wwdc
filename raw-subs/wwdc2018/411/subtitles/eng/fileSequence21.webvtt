00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:00.606 A:middle
open source project.

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:04.806 A:middle
Developing software in isolation

00:21:04.876 --> 00:21:06.266 A:middle
with all dependencies explicitly

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:10.686 A:middle
declared ensures that even

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.776 A:middle
packages with complex

00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:13.476 A:middle
requirements can be reliably

00:21:13.476 --> 00:21:15.036 A:middle
built and used in different

00:21:15.036 --> 00:21:15.736 A:middle
environments.

00:21:17.016 --> 00:21:18.376 A:middle
Instead of installing packages

00:21:18.376 --> 00:21:19.596 A:middle
globally into the system,

00:21:19.786 --> 00:21:21.506 A:middle
SwiftPM only allows you to use

00:21:21.506 --> 00:21:23.366 A:middle
packages that you explicitly

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:23.956 A:middle
depend on.

00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:26.176 A:middle
We also leverage build

00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:29.116 A:middle
sandboxing so that nothing can

00:21:29.116 --> 00:21:30.526 A:middle
write to arbitrary locations on

00:21:30.526 --> 00:21:31.786 A:middle
the file system during the

00:21:31.786 --> 00:21:32.106 A:middle
build.

00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:36.216 A:middle
SwiftPM does not allow executing

00:21:36.216 --> 00:21:37.676 A:middle
arbitrary commands, or shell

00:21:37.676 --> 00:21:39.056 A:middle
scripts, as part of the build.

00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:41.326 A:middle
This allows us to fully

00:21:41.326 --> 00:21:44.016 A:middle
understand your build graph and

00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:46.396 A:middle
all of its inputs and outputs to

00:21:46.396 --> 00:21:48.516 A:middle
do fast, as well as correct,

00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:49.366 A:middle
incremental builds.

00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:52.486 A:middle
Because we have a view of all

00:21:52.486 --> 00:21:53.326 A:middle
your dependencies.

00:21:53.946 --> 00:21:56.726 A:middle
As I showed you in the demo

00:21:56.726 --> 00:21:59.016 A:middle
before, SwiftPM also supports

00:21:59.046 --> 00:21:59.496 A:middle
testing.
