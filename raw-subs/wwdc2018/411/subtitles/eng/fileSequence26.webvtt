00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:01.066 A:middle
looking thoughts on package

00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:02.646 A:middle
discovery and trust.

00:26:02.986 --> 00:26:05.896 A:middle
While the SwiftPM command line

00:26:05.896 --> 00:26:07.726 A:middle
experience is important, we want

00:26:07.726 --> 00:26:09.036 A:middle
to make sure that SwiftPM can

00:26:09.036 --> 00:26:11.026 A:middle
integrate with other tools, such

00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:12.386 A:middle
as development environments,

00:26:12.676 --> 00:26:14.316 A:middle
automation, and more.

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:16.846 A:middle
We've already laid the

00:26:16.846 --> 00:26:18.096 A:middle
groundwork for this with

00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:19.776 A:middle
SwiftPM's library-based

00:26:19.776 --> 00:26:20.466 A:middle
architecture.

00:26:21.356 --> 00:26:22.726 A:middle
SwiftPM doesn't have a stable

00:26:22.726 --> 00:26:25.076 A:middle
API today, but for tools that

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:26.296 A:middle
are willing to keep up with the

00:26:26.296 --> 00:26:28.186 A:middle
SwiftPM changes, it's available

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:30.226 A:middle
for adoption and additions

00:26:30.226 --> 00:26:30.686 A:middle
today.

00:26:32.256 --> 00:26:33.646 A:middle
If you're looking to build

00:26:33.646 --> 00:26:35.156 A:middle
support for SwiftPM into your

00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:36.956 A:middle
developer tools, we welcome your

00:26:36.956 --> 00:26:38.446 A:middle
contributions and discussion.

00:26:38.856 --> 00:26:40.786 A:middle
We want to make SwiftPM part of

00:26:40.786 --> 00:26:42.256 A:middle
a thriving ecosystem of

00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:43.196 A:middle
developer tools.

00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:46.666 A:middle
One thing we've seen requested

00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:48.596 A:middle
recently on the Swift forums is

00:26:48.596 --> 00:26:50.406 A:middle
a way for people to edit their

00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:52.276 A:middle
package.swift manifest from

00:26:52.276 --> 00:26:53.946 A:middle
automated tools, instead of

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:55.796 A:middle
making their users always edit

00:26:55.796 --> 00:26:56.966 A:middle
the source code directly.

00:26:57.746 --> 00:26:59.166 A:middle
We think that it's possible for

00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:00.536 A:middle
SwiftPM to support this,
