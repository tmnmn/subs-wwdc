00:35:58.746 --> 00:36:00.186 A:middle
thinking about trying something

00:36:00.186 --> 00:36:01.686 A:middle
new, I encourage you to give it

00:36:01.686 --> 00:36:02.136 A:middle
a try.

00:36:03.046 --> 00:36:04.176 A:middle
And if you're interested in

00:36:04.176 --> 00:36:05.946 A:middle
contributing, swing by the Swift

00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:07.786 A:middle
forums and start a conversation.

00:36:08.796 --> 00:36:09.986 A:middle
If you'd like to come chat with

00:36:09.986 --> 00:36:11.876 A:middle
us, you can find us in the labs

00:36:11.876 --> 00:36:15.326 A:middle
tomorrow at 3 p.m. Ultimately,

00:36:15.326 --> 00:36:16.626 A:middle
I'm really excited about where

00:36:16.626 --> 00:36:17.906 A:middle
we can go from here and what

00:36:17.906 --> 00:36:19.366 A:middle
this developer community can do

00:36:19.366 --> 00:36:19.826 A:middle
together.

00:36:20.586 --> 00:36:21.886 A:middle
Your contributions will help us

00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:23.626 A:middle
design a package manager that

00:36:23.626 --> 00:36:24.996 A:middle
will be great for the whole

00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:25.796 A:middle
Swift community.

00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:27.226 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:28.916 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of WWDC.
