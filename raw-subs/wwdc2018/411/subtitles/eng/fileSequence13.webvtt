00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:00.716 A:middle
package manifest.

00:13:01.426 --> 00:13:04.136 A:middle
And this also allows you to use

00:13:04.136 --> 00:13:05.376 A:middle
a programming language you're

00:13:05.376 --> 00:13:06.346 A:middle
already familiar with.

00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:11.346 A:middle
For the rest of the section, I

00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:12.436 A:middle
will take you on a journey

00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:13.726 A:middle
through the different steps you

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
will encounter when creating

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.136 A:middle
your own Swift packages.

00:13:16.766 --> 00:13:18.736 A:middle
We will start with

00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:19.576 A:middle
configuration.

00:13:23.096 --> 00:13:25.126 A:middle
As we saw earlier, SwiftPM's

00:13:25.126 --> 00:13:26.796 A:middle
manifest is based on Swift.

00:13:27.336 --> 00:13:28.906 A:middle
Using Swift makes it easy to

00:13:28.906 --> 00:13:31.116 A:middle
understand because there is no

00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:32.136 A:middle
new language to learn.

00:13:32.736 --> 00:13:34.646 A:middle
We follow Swift's API design

00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:36.876 A:middle
guidelines to make it even more

00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:37.416 A:middle
familiar.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:40.216 A:middle
And, it allows us to take

00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:42.216 A:middle
advantage of existing tooling

00:13:42.276 --> 00:13:47.086 A:middle
written for Swift, but when

00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:48.586 A:middle
writing your own manifest, you

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.076 A:middle
should still prefer declarative

00:13:50.076 --> 00:13:51.946 A:middle
syntax and avoid side effects.

00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:54.586 A:middle
Because SwiftPM makes no

00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:56.766 A:middle
guarantees about when or how

00:13:56.766 --> 00:13:58.746 A:middle
often your source code is being

00:13:58.746 --> 00:13:59.406 A:middle
evaluated.
