[ Applause ]

00:04:07.076 --> 00:04:08.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Rick.

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:09.796 A:middle
Let's take a look at how to use

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:10.366 A:middle
SwiftPM.

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:15.096 A:middle
SwiftPM consists of four command

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:16.976 A:middle
line tools, and at the top level

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:17.666 A:middle
Swift Command.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.136 A:middle
Swift Build, to build your

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:20.726 A:middle
package.

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:23.066 A:middle
Swift Run to run its executable

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:23.676 A:middle
products.

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:26.466 A:middle
Swift Test to run tests.

00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:29.326 A:middle
And Swift Package to run various

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:31.956 A:middle
non-build operations on the

00:04:32.996 --> 00:04:33.176 A:middle
package.

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:34.756 A:middle
Packages are stored in git

00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:35.566 A:middle
repositories.

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:37.876 A:middle
And diversions are represented

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:38.756 A:middle
by git tags.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.496 A:middle
Next, I'm going to show you a

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:45.866 A:middle
demo of how easy it is to create

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:47.416 A:middle
your own first Swift Package.

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:54.026 A:middle
We start in terminal, and we

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.246 A:middle
create a new directory, called

00:04:56.246 --> 00:04:56.886 A:middle
helloworld.

00:04:57.806 --> 00:04:58.926 A:middle
This will also be the name of

00:04:58.926 --> 00:04:59.656 A:middle
our package.
