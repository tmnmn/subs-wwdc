00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:02.716 A:middle
For the playing card package,

00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:04.326 A:middle
we're using up to the next minor

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:04.976 A:middle
syntax.

00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:06.866 A:middle
This means, we're getting only

00:19:06.866 --> 00:19:08.316 A:middle
updates to the patch component.

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:10.466 A:middle
You might want to use that

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:11.786 A:middle
syntax if you want to be more

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:13.416 A:middle
conservative as a dependency and

00:19:13.416 --> 00:19:14.576 A:middle
only take bug fixes.

00:19:15.216 --> 00:19:17.786 A:middle
In this case, we're ending up

00:19:17.786 --> 00:19:21.916 A:middle
with a tag 3.0.2.

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:23.626 A:middle
Finally, when looking at a

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:26.486 A:middle
target, SwiftPM has to match up

00:19:26.576 --> 00:19:28.456 A:middle
its required products with the

00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:30.606 A:middle
packages that we resolved.

00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:32.556 A:middle
For this, we're looking at the

00:19:32.556 --> 00:19:34.996 A:middle
dealer target from the demo, and

00:19:34.996 --> 00:19:36.696 A:middle
as you can see, the utility

00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:39.176 A:middle
product is provided by the

00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:40.346 A:middle
SwiftPM package.

00:19:41.476 --> 00:19:43.116 A:middle
And the rest of the packages

00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:45.186 A:middle
provide the other products.

00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:50.156 A:middle
After dependency resolution, the

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:52.106 A:middle
resolves are recorded in a file

00:19:52.106 --> 00:19:53.236 A:middle
called package.resolved.

00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:56.106 A:middle
the purpose of this file is so

00:19:56.106 --> 00:19:57.556 A:middle
that you can share the resolve

00:19:57.606 --> 00:19:59.086 A:middle
versions with other members of

00:19:59.086 --> 00:20:01.076 A:middle
your team, or your continuous
