00:28:00.206 --> 00:28:02.776 A:middle
There is a convenience function

00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:03.296 A:middle
in vImage.

00:28:03.356 --> 00:28:06.606 A:middle
vImageCreatesCGImage FromBuffer

00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:09.606 A:middle
that helps you to create a

00:28:09.606 --> 00:28:11.286 A:middle
cgImage based on the buffer you

00:28:11.286 --> 00:28:12.596 A:middle
already have in vImage.

00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:15.566 A:middle
One thing to note is that we're

00:28:15.566 --> 00:28:17.706 A:middle
not actually copying the large

00:28:17.706 --> 00:28:19.636 A:middle
data buffer in the image from

00:28:19.636 --> 00:28:20.726 A:middle
one place to another.

00:28:21.206 --> 00:28:23.426 A:middle
We're simply creating a cgImage

00:28:23.426 --> 00:28:25.956 A:middle
object that adds a container to

00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:27.306 A:middle
this image buffer.

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:29.876 A:middle
So we are only filling in the

00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.716 A:middle
information that cgImage needs,

00:28:31.716 --> 00:28:33.576 A:middle
create a cgImage objects,

00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:35.966 A:middle
instead of copying data around.

00:28:36.556 --> 00:28:39.136 A:middle
Once we have that, we can send

00:28:39.136 --> 00:28:41.456 A:middle
the cgImage object to the image

00:28:41.456 --> 00:28:43.616 A:middle
view, and it will be displayed

00:28:43.706 --> 00:28:44.406 A:middle
on the screen.

00:28:45.016 --> 00:28:45.796 A:middle
So it's that simple.

00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:48.146 A:middle
Four steps and you can create

00:28:48.146 --> 00:28:50.626 A:middle
your own effects, we show you

00:28:50.626 --> 00:28:51.656 A:middle
the saturation effects.

00:28:52.026 --> 00:28:54.736 A:middle
Now, there are other effects we

00:28:54.736 --> 00:28:56.166 A:middle
can do with vImage.

00:28:56.816 --> 00:28:59.116 A:middle
We can do a rotation, like I

00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
said before, rotate the image
