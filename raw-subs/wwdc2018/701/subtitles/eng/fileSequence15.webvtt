00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:01.406 A:middle
rotation on this vector using a

00:15:01.406 --> 00:15:01.896 A:middle
quaternion.

00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:04.836 A:middle
Technically, we're rotating the

00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:06.176 A:middle
entire scene, but for purposes

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:07.066 A:middle
of illustration, we're going to

00:15:07.066 --> 00:15:08.256 A:middle
say we're rotating this vector.

00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:11.116 A:middle
When using a quaternion for

00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:12.896 A:middle
rotations, you need to specify

00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:14.406 A:middle
an axis and angle of rotation.

00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:16.716 A:middle
Or to put it another way, what

00:15:17.006 --> 00:15:18.386 A:middle
are you rotating about and by

00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:18.956 A:middle
how much.

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.126 A:middle
So we're going to rotate about

00:15:21.126 --> 00:15:22.506 A:middle
the x axis, and we're going to

00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:26.426 A:middle
rotate pi over 3 radians up.

00:15:27.706 --> 00:15:28.736 A:middle
You apply the rotation by

00:15:28.736 --> 00:15:30.046 A:middle
calling the simd act function.

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:33.256 A:middle
This applies the action of the

00:15:33.256 --> 00:15:34.326 A:middle
quaternion on that vector and

00:15:34.326 --> 00:15:35.646 A:middle
returns a rotated vector.

00:15:36.106 --> 00:15:37.786 A:middle
So let's take a look at that

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:37.946 A:middle
now.

00:15:47.256 --> 00:15:48.566 A:middle
So normally you're not

00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:49.846 A:middle
interested in rotating along a

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:50.626 A:middle
single axis.

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:51.856 A:middle
You usually want to rotate along

00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:54.906 A:middle
multiple axes, and if you're

00:15:54.906 --> 00:15:55.856 A:middle
already familiar with rotation

00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:56.996 A:middle
matrices, this is going to seem

00:15:56.996 --> 00:15:57.566 A:middle
very natural.
