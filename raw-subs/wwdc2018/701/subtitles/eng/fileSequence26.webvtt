00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.256 A:middle
We need to take the image from

00:26:03.256 --> 00:26:03.726 A:middle
the camera.

00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:06.516 A:middle
How do we do that?

00:26:06.556 --> 00:26:07.546 A:middle
We need to write a delegate

00:26:07.546 --> 00:26:10.616 A:middle
method, and what camera gives us

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:12.246 A:middle
is a CV image buffer.

00:26:13.376 --> 00:26:14.806 A:middle
So we get the buffer.

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:17.706 A:middle
We have to make sure this buffer

00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:19.586 A:middle
is accessible to CPU.

00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:21.186 A:middle
That's where vImage lives.

00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:24.196 A:middle
After we apply the effects,

00:26:24.676 --> 00:26:26.026 A:middle
whatever effects that may be,

00:26:26.426 --> 00:26:28.416 A:middle
and we have to unlock the base

00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:31.066 A:middle
address of this pixel buffer so

00:26:31.066 --> 00:26:32.736 A:middle
that the camera can reuse this

00:26:32.736 --> 00:26:33.386 A:middle
piece of memory.

00:26:36.556 --> 00:26:38.236 A:middle
The second step, we have to

00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:40.116 A:middle
prepare the vImage input and

00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:40.706 A:middle
output buffer.

00:26:43.276 --> 00:26:45.486 A:middle
We already have this image in CV

00:26:45.546 --> 00:26:46.616 A:middle
image buffer.

00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:48.676 A:middle
All we need to do is just get

00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:50.696 A:middle
the information such as height

00:26:51.336 --> 00:26:54.206 A:middle
and width, and then we can

00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:55.856 A:middle
package this into a vImage

00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:57.906 A:middle
buffer object so it can be

00:26:57.906 --> 00:26:59.376 A:middle
consumed by vImage library.

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.346 A:middle
We do this for luminance and
