00:33:58.676 --> 00:34:00.316 A:middle
additional computational power

00:34:00.316 --> 00:34:02.146 A:middle
into a machine, you need the

00:34:02.146 --> 00:34:03.456 A:middle
matching [inaudible] to fully

00:34:03.456 --> 00:34:05.086 A:middle
utilize this additional

00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:05.956 A:middle
computational power.

00:34:06.726 --> 00:34:07.936 A:middle
And that is where we come in.

00:34:09.016 --> 00:34:11.056 A:middle
Remember, this is the same

00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:12.786 A:middle
LINPACK Benchmark executable

00:34:13.275 --> 00:34:15.076 A:middle
running on all five generations

00:34:15.076 --> 00:34:15.976 A:middle
of iPhones.

00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:17.496 A:middle
They all got the best

00:34:17.496 --> 00:34:19.005 A:middle
performance using Accelerate

00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:22.806 A:middle
without changing a bit.

00:34:23.386 --> 00:34:24.656 A:middle
The same is also true for your

00:34:24.656 --> 00:34:25.076 A:middle
apps.

00:34:25.636 --> 00:34:27.545 A:middle
If you use Accelerate in your

00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:29.315 A:middle
apps, you'll get the best

00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:32.795 A:middle
performance automatically on all

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:34.096 A:middle
the architectures we support.

00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:38.786 A:middle
Moreover, Accelerate supports

00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:40.386 A:middle
across platforms.

00:34:41.065 --> 00:34:43.525 A:middle
Accelerate works on macOS, iOS,

00:34:43.806 --> 00:34:45.456 A:middle
tvOS, watchOS.

00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:48.996 A:middle
So let's say if tomorrow Apple

00:34:48.996 --> 00:34:49.946 A:middle
comes out with a new

00:34:49.946 --> 00:34:51.996 A:middle
architecture or new platform,

00:34:52.485 --> 00:34:53.436 A:middle
you don't have to worry about

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:53.636 A:middle
it.

00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:56.606 A:middle
All you need to do, the most

00:34:56.606 --> 00:34:58.596 A:middle
you'll ever need to do is just

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.256 A:middle
to rebuild your apps, link
