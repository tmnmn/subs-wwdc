00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:00.646 A:middle
We have vImage erode, vImage

00:22:00.646 --> 00:22:02.566 A:middle
dilate to make the object

00:22:02.566 --> 00:22:04.016 A:middle
smaller and bigger.

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.996 A:middle
If you're feeling adventurous,

00:22:06.996 --> 00:22:08.506 A:middle
you can actually provide a

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:10.336 A:middle
custom shape of kernels to these

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:13.126 A:middle
functions, and vImage erode and

00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:15.436 A:middle
dilate will make the object

00:22:15.436 --> 00:22:17.246 A:middle
smaller or bigger according to

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:18.396 A:middle
the kernel you provided.

00:22:20.406 --> 00:22:21.986 A:middle
Those are the five things in

00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:22.576 A:middle
vImage.

00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:24.626 A:middle
Now, I want to show you a demo

00:22:24.626 --> 00:22:26.256 A:middle
app that we wrote based on

00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:28.096 A:middle
vImage and show you what kind of

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:28.976 A:middle
effect you can get from vImage.

00:22:34.046 --> 00:22:35.566 A:middle
What I have here is a lab that

00:22:35.606 --> 00:22:37.496 A:middle
captures images using the back

00:22:37.496 --> 00:22:40.936 A:middle
camera and put the image onto

00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:41.456 A:middle
the screen.

00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:44.656 A:middle
And we're doing in real-time.

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:45.956 A:middle
This is a live stream, so you

00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:47.666 A:middle
can see the drinking bird doing

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.696 A:middle
its motion next to the roses.

00:22:50.656 --> 00:22:51.806 A:middle
All right, the first effect I

00:22:51.806 --> 00:22:53.206 A:middle
want to show you is the color

00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:54.256 A:middle
saturation effect.

00:22:54.856 --> 00:22:57.246 A:middle
You can see this effect in a lot

00:22:57.246 --> 00:22:59.406 A:middle
of photo editing software.
