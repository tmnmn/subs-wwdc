00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:00.986 A:middle
to move onto the next topic.

00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:05.446 A:middle
LINPACK Benchmark.

00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:07.866 A:middle
We talked about the

00:32:07.866 --> 00:32:09.426 A:middle
functionality of Accelerate.

00:32:09.986 --> 00:32:12.026 A:middle
We talk about how easy it is to

00:32:12.026 --> 00:32:13.616 A:middle
use in Accelerate in your apps.

00:32:14.456 --> 00:32:16.456 A:middle
We haven't talked about how fast

00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:17.766 A:middle
Accelerate really is.

00:32:18.676 --> 00:32:20.026 A:middle
And LINPACK Benchmark is a

00:32:20.026 --> 00:32:23.326 A:middle
perfect tool to do that.

00:32:23.526 --> 00:32:24.706 A:middle
What is LINPACK Benchmark?

00:32:25.796 --> 00:32:26.826 A:middle
Basically, it's trying to

00:32:26.826 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
measure how fast you can solve a

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:30.446 A:middle
linear system on your machine.

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:32.586 A:middle
There are actually three

00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:34.526 A:middle
different LINPACK Benchmarks.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.136 A:middle
The first one is solving a

00:32:36.136 --> 00:32:37.916 A:middle
100-by-100 linear system.

00:32:38.516 --> 00:32:40.086 A:middle
The second one is solving a

00:32:40.086 --> 00:32:41.356 A:middle
1000-by-1000.

00:32:41.706 --> 00:32:44.526 A:middle
The last one, which is the most

00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:46.286 A:middle
interesting one, that's the one

00:32:46.286 --> 00:32:48.236 A:middle
we're going to use today, is no

00:32:48.236 --> 00:32:48.776 A:middle
holds barred.

00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:50.856 A:middle
You can solve as large a system

00:32:50.856 --> 00:32:53.486 A:middle
you want to fully utilize every

00:32:53.486 --> 00:32:54.906 A:middle
last bit of the computational

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:55.996 A:middle
power on your machine.

00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:59.136 A:middle
Let's see the performance of

00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:01.646 A:middle
iPhone X using Accelerate.
