00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:01.626 A:middle
You'll also notice the blue bar.

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.396 A:middle
The blue bar is the threshold

00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:05.416 A:middle
slider, so you can see I can

00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:06.266 A:middle
move it.

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:10.026 A:middle
So what I'm going to do now is

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:11.386 A:middle
add some more noise to the

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:11.746 A:middle
signal.

00:05:12.706 --> 00:05:13.656 A:middle
Actually, let's add quite a bit

00:05:13.656 --> 00:05:13.976 A:middle
of noise.

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:19.526 A:middle
So you can see the signal that

00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:21.286 A:middle
I'm still interested in is

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:22.896 A:middle
represented by the spikes on the

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.896 A:middle
left or another way of looking

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:26.036 A:middle
at it is the spikes with the

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:28.326 A:middle
tallest height, and what we've

00:05:28.326 --> 00:05:29.366 A:middle
added, the type of noise we're

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:30.406 A:middle
adding to this, is background

00:05:30.406 --> 00:05:30.726 A:middle
noise.

00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:32.176 A:middle
So it's kind of evenly

00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:34.026 A:middle
distributed spikes everywhere,

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:36.746 A:middle
but they're low-level spikes.

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:38.876 A:middle
So now I'm going to remove this

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:40.276 A:middle
noise, and the way I'm going to

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
do this is I'm going to move

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:42.436 A:middle
this threshold slightly higher.

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:45.956 A:middle
As I do this, what's happening

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:47.816 A:middle
is, behind the scenes, is we're

00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:50.246 A:middle
identifying any frequency

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:51.146 A:middle
component less than this

00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:52.466 A:middle
threshold and removing it.

00:05:52.646 --> 00:05:54.166 A:middle
We're saying effectively if

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.876 A:middle
there is any spike with a height

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:57.056 A:middle
less than this blue bar, we're

00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:58.586 A:middle
going to pretend it's noise and

00:05:58.586 --> 00:05:59.726 A:middle
remove it.
