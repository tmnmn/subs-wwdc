00:11:01.636 --> 00:11:04.736 A:middle
Now the artifact removal is a

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:06.886 A:middle
little bit more advanced, so I'm

00:11:06.886 --> 00:11:07.646 A:middle
only going to go through this at

00:11:07.646 --> 00:11:08.736 A:middle
a very high level.

00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:10.056 A:middle
I recommend you download the

00:11:10.056 --> 00:11:11.126 A:middle
sample application that's

00:11:11.126 --> 00:11:13.066 A:middle
available online right now, and

00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:14.666 A:middle
each one of these routines is

00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:16.726 A:middle
also documented under vDSP, and

00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:17.536 A:middle
we have excellent online

00:11:17.536 --> 00:11:18.176 A:middle
documentation.

00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:21.726 A:middle
A high level what we're going to

00:11:21.726 --> 00:11:22.926 A:middle
do is we're going to identify

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:24.346 A:middle
the magnitude of the frequency

00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:25.686 A:middle
components, in this case with

00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:26.166 A:middle
the sample.

00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:28.956 A:middle
We're then going to identify the

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.046 A:middle
components we want to remove.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.806 A:middle
We're then going to create a

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:35.916 A:middle
mask from that.

00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:37.936 A:middle
And once we've done that, we're

00:11:37.936 --> 00:11:39.136 A:middle
going to apply that mask to the

00:11:39.136 --> 00:11:39.506 A:middle
image.

00:11:40.856 --> 00:11:42.196 A:middle
Effectively what we're doing is

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:44.066 A:middle
we're multiplying by 0 the

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:45.446 A:middle
components we want to remove and

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:46.796 A:middle
by 1 the components we want to

00:11:46.796 --> 00:11:46.976 A:middle
keep.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:53.756 A:middle
We're going to use zrop again to

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:54.636 A:middle
reconstruct the image.

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:56.306 A:middle
Because this is an FFT, we get

00:11:56.306 --> 00:11:57.376 A:middle
to reuse the context.
