00:23:57.876 --> 00:24:00.246 A:middle
First, of course, we have to get

00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:02.186 A:middle
the image from the camera, and

00:24:03.476 --> 00:24:05.836 A:middle
then we want to use vImage to

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:08.746 A:middle
process, to apply the effect, so

00:24:08.746 --> 00:24:10.436 A:middle
we have to prepare the input and

00:24:10.436 --> 00:24:12.036 A:middle
output buffer for vImage.

00:24:13.456 --> 00:24:15.576 A:middle
Then we actually calling vImage

00:24:15.576 --> 00:24:16.756 A:middle
functions to apply these

00:24:16.756 --> 00:24:19.936 A:middle
effects, and we display the

00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:21.186 A:middle
output to the screen.

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:25.286 A:middle
Let me jump ahead and talk about

00:24:25.286 --> 00:24:27.006 A:middle
how do we apply effects using

00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:27.956 A:middle
vImage functions.

00:24:29.076 --> 00:24:32.096 A:middle
The effect I show you is a color

00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:34.306 A:middle
saturation effect, and here is

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.966 A:middle
the formula to do color

00:24:35.966 --> 00:24:36.616 A:middle
saturation.

00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:38.886 A:middle
Basically, we want to remove the

00:24:38.886 --> 00:24:41.886 A:middle
bias from the pixel, and using

00:24:41.886 --> 00:24:43.376 A:middle
multiplication to apply the

00:24:43.376 --> 00:24:46.746 A:middle
saturation effects, and then we

00:24:46.746 --> 00:24:48.326 A:middle
put the bias back to the pixel.

00:24:49.686 --> 00:24:51.786 A:middle
VImage has exactly the function

00:24:51.786 --> 00:24:54.116 A:middle
to do this operation, which is

00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:55.956 A:middle
vImage matrix multiply.

00:24:58.246 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
VImage matrix multiply takes the
