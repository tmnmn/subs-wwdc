00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:00.596 A:middle
linear algebra as well as sparse

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:03.336 A:middle
linear algebra, and we have a

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.176 A:middle
specialized library for neural

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:06.626 A:middle
networks called BNNS.

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:07.896 A:middle
It stands for Basic Neural

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.726 A:middle
Network Subroutines.

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:10.916 A:middle
Not strictly part of the

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:12.596 A:middle
Accelerate framework but very

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:13.716 A:middle
closely related, and we find

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:14.796 A:middle
these libraries very useful,

00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:16.656 A:middle
include libraries like simd,

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.336 A:middle
which is a vector programming

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:20.636 A:middle
aid for the CPU, and

00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:21.956 A:middle
Compression, which contains

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:23.386 A:middle
several different lossless data

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.136 A:middle
compression algorithms.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:27.116 A:middle
So let's take a look at our

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:27.766 A:middle
first library.

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:30.646 A:middle
We're going to take a look at

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:31.776 A:middle
vDSP.

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:33.186 A:middle
VDSP is a state-of-the-art

00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:34.346 A:middle
signal processing library, and

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:35.556 A:middle
it contains a wide range of

00:03:35.556 --> 00:03:36.606 A:middle
signal processing primitives.

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:39.016 A:middle
These range from basic

00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:40.456 A:middle
arithmetic operations on arrays

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:43.396 A:middle
such as add and subtract as well

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:44.806 A:middle
as more complicated operations

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:47.716 A:middle
like convolution and FFTs.

00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:50.306 A:middle
If you're a successful app

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:51.846 A:middle
developer and maybe in the past

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:54.196 A:middle
you have avoided FFTs, I want to

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:55.156 A:middle
show you how we make that easy

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:55.776 A:middle
with Accelerate.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:57.326 A:middle
With just a few lines of code,

00:03:57.486 --> 00:03:58.286 A:middle
you can make that work.

00:03:59.206 --> 00:03:59.946 A:middle
And I have an example.

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:00.696 A:middle
I'm going to show you how to
