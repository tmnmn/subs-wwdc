00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:00.696 A:middle
I'm going to show you how to

00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:01.976 A:middle
extract signal from noise.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:15.936 A:middle
So what we have here is an audio

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:16.315 A:middle
signal.

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:18.005 A:middle
This is the base signal.

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.346 A:middle
We haven't added any noise to it

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:20.926 A:middle
yet, and you'll notice I have

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:21.946 A:middle
two sliders at the bottom.

00:04:22.506 --> 00:04:24.196 A:middle
In the lower left I have a

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:27.236 A:middle
slider that lets me add noise,

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:30.316 A:middle
and you can see that.

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:31.976 A:middle
And I also have a second slider

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:33.196 A:middle
that let's me remove this noise

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:35.366 A:middle
called Threshold.

00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:38.216 A:middle
You'll also notice I have a

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:39.306 A:middle
toggle switch in the lower

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:39.566 A:middle
right.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.596 A:middle
This lets me look at this under

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:43.276 A:middle
a different domain.

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:45.456 A:middle
So currently we're looking at

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:46.696 A:middle
this signal under the time

00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:47.026 A:middle
domain.

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.276 A:middle
We're going to do some analysis

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.416 A:middle
and see this signal in the

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:51.056 A:middle
frequency domain.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:54.396 A:middle
You can see all the spikes on

00:04:54.396 --> 00:04:54.836 A:middle
the left.

00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:56.296 A:middle
Those are the frequency

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.806 A:middle
components of the signal.

00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:01.626 A:middle
You'll also notice the blue bar.
