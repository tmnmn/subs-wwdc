&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:24.156 A:middle
How is everybody?

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
I'm an engineer at Apple.

Welcome to the Using Accelerate

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:34.376 A:middle
and simd session.

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:38.096 A:middle
So my colleague Luke Chang and I

00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:39.046 A:middle
are pretty excited today.

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:40.756 A:middle
We get to talk to you about all

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:41.716 A:middle
the great APIs that are

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.206 A:middle
available in Accelerate and its

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.656 A:middle
associated frameworks, and we're

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:46.386 A:middle
going to start by taking a

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.716 A:middle
high-level overview of

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:48.696 A:middle
Accelerate and some of the

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:49.596 A:middle
high-performance libraries that

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:51.216 A:middle
are contained inside it.

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:52.516 A:middle
We're then going to take a deep

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.196 A:middle
dive into a few of libraries,

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:56.346 A:middle
and we're going to start by

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:57.196 A:middle
taking a look at vDSP.

00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:59.766 A:middle
We have two examples for you.
