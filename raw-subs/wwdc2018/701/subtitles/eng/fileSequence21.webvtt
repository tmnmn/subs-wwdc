00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:01.416 A:middle
we'll have high-quality output

00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:02.666 A:middle
after the operation.

00:21:03.366 --> 00:21:06.186 A:middle
We also have vImage rotate that

00:21:06.186 --> 00:21:07.826 A:middle
can rotate image clockwise or

00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:08.906 A:middle
counterclockwise.

00:21:09.346 --> 00:21:13.016 A:middle
Next, convolution function.

00:21:13.486 --> 00:21:15.616 A:middle
The most notable effect of

00:21:15.616 --> 00:21:17.576 A:middle
convolution function is the blur

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:17.846 A:middle
effect.

00:21:18.836 --> 00:21:20.296 A:middle
You see blur effect all the

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:23.116 A:middle
time, in UI, in photography.

00:21:23.326 --> 00:21:25.086 A:middle
If you want to phase something

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:26.656 A:middle
into the background, you can

00:21:26.656 --> 00:21:28.576 A:middle
apply the blur function, blur

00:21:29.986 --> 00:21:30.156 A:middle
effect.

00:21:31.126 --> 00:21:32.786 A:middle
Next, transform function.

00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:35.616 A:middle
Transform function is basically

00:21:35.616 --> 00:21:36.786 A:middle
a matrix multiply.

00:21:37.446 --> 00:21:39.346 A:middle
It lets you operate on the data

00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:40.586 A:middle
channel of each pixel.

00:21:41.256 --> 00:21:42.576 A:middle
Let's say you want to increase

00:21:42.576 --> 00:21:44.736 A:middle
red or increase green, you can

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:46.016 A:middle
do that with transform

00:21:46.016 --> 00:21:46.566 A:middle
functions.

00:21:48.196 --> 00:21:49.426 A:middle
Morphology.

00:21:50.456 --> 00:21:52.926 A:middle
Morphology changes the size or

00:21:52.926 --> 00:21:54.866 A:middle
shape of the objects in the

00:21:54.866 --> 00:21:56.926 A:middle
image, not the image itself.

00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:00.646 A:middle
We have vImage erode, vImage
