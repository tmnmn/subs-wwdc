00:29:56.026 --> 00:30:01.246 A:middle
And I can apply more blurring or

00:30:01.856 --> 00:30:04.116 A:middle
slide to the left, bring the

00:30:04.116 --> 00:30:05.796 A:middle
roses back to the foreground.

00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:10.726 A:middle
For black and white, I can use

00:30:11.596 --> 00:30:11.796 A:middle
dithering.

00:30:12.316 --> 00:30:14.916 A:middle
Now this black and white image,

00:30:15.066 --> 00:30:16.846 A:middle
the gray scale is represented

00:30:16.846 --> 00:30:18.666 A:middle
now by the density of the dots,

00:30:18.886 --> 00:30:19.976 A:middle
that's the dithering effect.

00:30:20.156 --> 00:30:21.766 A:middle
And we use the accents and

00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:24.146 A:middle
dithering algorithm for this,

00:30:24.206 --> 00:30:25.326 A:middle
and I will show you how to do it

00:30:25.326 --> 00:30:28.076 A:middle
later, and for color

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:29.766 A:middle
quantization, we have lookup

00:30:29.766 --> 00:30:30.126 A:middle
table.

00:30:30.446 --> 00:30:32.626 A:middle
And I can move this slider to

00:30:32.626 --> 00:30:34.186 A:middle
increase the quantization level.

00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:35.996 A:middle
As I move the slider to the

00:30:35.996 --> 00:30:39.006 A:middle
right, fewer and fewer color is

00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:40.646 A:middle
available in this image.

00:30:41.386 --> 00:30:44.766 A:middle
That's sort of creative, that's

00:30:44.766 --> 00:30:46.616 A:middle
how your computer screen looks

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:49.706 A:middle
like in the '90's or in the

00:30:49.886 --> 00:30:49.996 A:middle
'80's.

00:30:50.486 --> 00:30:50.936 A:middle
All right.

00:30:51.286 --> 00:30:54.306 A:middle
So let me show you how we do

00:30:54.306 --> 00:30:54.516 A:middle
that.

00:30:58.536 --> 00:30:59.836 A:middle
For rotation effect, you can

00:30:59.836 --> 00:31:03.036 A:middle
call vImageRotate and given the
