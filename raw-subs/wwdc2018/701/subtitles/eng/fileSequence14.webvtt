00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.686 A:middle
In addition to vector and matrix

00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:03.696 A:middle
objects and allowing you to

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:06.016 A:middle
perform arithmetic operations on

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:06.636 A:middle
these objects.

00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:09.896 A:middle
It has extensions.

00:14:09.896 --> 00:14:11.886 A:middle
So for instance, dot products

00:14:12.766 --> 00:14:13.826 A:middle
and clamp.

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:15.176 A:middle
It also has support for the

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:16.346 A:middle
transcendental functions, so for

00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:20.096 A:middle
instance sine and cosine as well

00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:20.816 A:middle
as quaternions.

00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:23.116 A:middle
Quaternions are very useful for

00:14:23.116 --> 00:14:24.416 A:middle
representing rotations in three

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:25.996 A:middle
dimensions, and I actually want

00:14:25.996 --> 00:14:27.076 A:middle
to talk a little bit more about

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:27.346 A:middle
those.

00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:30.836 A:middle
So I'm going to walk you through

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:31.856 A:middle
a coding example.

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:34.666 A:middle
There's quite a bit to unpack

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:34.836 A:middle
here.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.566 A:middle
So we're going to start on the

00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:36.826 A:middle
right.

00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:38.416 A:middle
We have a unit sphere.

00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:39.696 A:middle
That's what this gray sphere is.

00:14:39.956 --> 00:14:41.526 A:middle
And you'll notice this red dot.

00:14:42.136 --> 00:14:44.206 A:middle
And that's actually the tip of

00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:44.686 A:middle
this vector.

00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:47.576 A:middle
We've declared a simd float3

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:47.986 A:middle
vector.

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:49.656 A:middle
We've set the x and y components

00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:51.576 A:middle
to 0 and the z component to 1.

00:14:52.176 --> 00:14:53.156 A:middle
So it's coming out at us.

00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:55.696 A:middle
And that red dot is represented

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:56.946 A:middle
by the tip of that vector.

00:14:58.926 --> 00:14:59.796 A:middle
We're now going to perform a

00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:01.406 A:middle
rotation on this vector using a
