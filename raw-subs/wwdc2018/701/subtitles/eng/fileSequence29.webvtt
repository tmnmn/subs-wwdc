00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
said before, rotate the image

00:29:00.916 --> 00:29:02.946 A:middle
clockwise, counterclockwise.

00:29:03.336 --> 00:29:05.736 A:middle
We can do blur or phase

00:29:05.736 --> 00:29:07.026 A:middle
something into the background.

00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:10.966 A:middle
And you feel, if you feel like

00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:12.136 A:middle
you want to add some retro

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:13.716 A:middle
feeling to your images, you can

00:29:13.716 --> 00:29:15.376 A:middle
do dithering for black and white

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:18.026 A:middle
images, and color quantization

00:29:18.206 --> 00:29:19.226 A:middle
for color images.

00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:21.436 A:middle
Let me show you how they look

00:29:21.436 --> 00:29:22.976 A:middle
like in the app.

00:29:36.536 --> 00:29:38.346 A:middle
So, again, I have the slider

00:29:38.346 --> 00:29:40.156 A:middle
here to control the rotation.

00:29:40.916 --> 00:29:44.346 A:middle
I can do rotate counterclockwise

00:29:45.976 --> 00:29:48.586 A:middle
or rotate clockwise.

00:29:49.146 --> 00:29:52.866 A:middle
Now I want to try the blurring

00:29:52.866 --> 00:29:53.206 A:middle
effect.

00:29:53.556 --> 00:29:55.016 A:middle
Let me click on the one here.

00:29:56.026 --> 00:30:01.246 A:middle
And I can apply more blurring or
