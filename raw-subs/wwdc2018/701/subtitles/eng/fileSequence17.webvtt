00:17:07.195 --> 00:17:08.546 A:middle
The second variant is Spline.

00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:11.126 A:middle
Spline is really more useful if

00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:12.396 A:middle
you have more than two

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:12.996 A:middle
rotations.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.066 A:middle
So, for instance, here we're

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:16.205 A:middle
going to interpolate between an

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.226 A:middle
array of rotations, and there's

00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:19.256 A:middle
quite a bit of boilerplate code

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.526 A:middle
here, so I want you to focus

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:21.476 A:middle
just on the Spline call.

00:17:23.695 --> 00:17:25.695 A:middle
Effectively what we're doing is

00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:27.175 A:middle
just iterating through all the

00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:28.465 A:middle
individual rotations and

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:28.946 A:middle
applying Spline.

00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:35.516 A:middle
So the thing you have to specify

00:17:35.516 --> 00:17:37.426 A:middle
with Spline is not only the two

00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:39.136 A:middle
rotations that you wish to

00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:40.696 A:middle
interpolate between but also the

00:17:40.696 --> 00:17:42.176 A:middle
previous and the next as well.

00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:44.856 A:middle
And this is what this looks

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:44.976 A:middle
like.

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.056 A:middle
So if you're a game developer,

00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:54.146 A:middle
you're probably not interested

00:17:54.146 --> 00:17:55.476 A:middle
in rotating individual vectors.

00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:56.486 A:middle
You're probably interested in

00:17:56.486 --> 00:17:57.286 A:middle
rotating objects.

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:58.766 A:middle
So we have that for you.

00:17:58.906 --> 00:17:59.936 A:middle
We have a cube.
