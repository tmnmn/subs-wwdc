00:07:58.926 --> 00:08:00.676 A:middle
context DCT execute, and this

00:08:00.676 --> 00:08:02.036 A:middle
will actually perform the work

00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:02.886 A:middle
of reconstructing the audio

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:03.216 A:middle
signal.

00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:08.356 A:middle
So what we've shown you is an

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:09.546 A:middle
example of how you can remove

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:11.026 A:middle
certain types of noise from an

00:08:11.026 --> 00:08:11.966 A:middle
audio signal using vDSP.

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:14.436 A:middle
I want to show you an example of

00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:15.396 A:middle
how we can remove certain types

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.126 A:middle
of noise from an image also

00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:17.836 A:middle
using vDSP.

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:22.496 A:middle
In this case, we're going to

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:23.596 A:middle
restore an old newspaper

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:23.966 A:middle
photograph.

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:32.816 A:middle
So what we've done is we've

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:35.916 A:middle
taken this image, and we've

00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:38.525 A:middle
applied a two-tone screen to it.

00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:40.796 A:middle
So this could represent an old

00:08:40.796 --> 00:08:41.716 A:middle
newspaper photograph.

00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:42.746 A:middle
And what we're going to try to

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:45.236 A:middle
do is remove this screen.

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:46.086 A:middle
We're going to try to remove the

00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:47.456 A:middle
artifacts that you see.

00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:49.636 A:middle
Currently, we're in off, so

00:08:49.636 --> 00:08:50.506 A:middle
we're not doing anything.

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:52.476 A:middle
What we're going to do is

00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:53.586 A:middle
actually take a sample of this

00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:55.196 A:middle
screen, and we're going to

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:56.796 A:middle
create a mask from that sample

00:08:56.796 --> 00:08:58.076 A:middle
and then apply that to the image

00:08:58.076 --> 00:08:58.796 A:middle
to try to remove it.

00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:00.576 A:middle
So let me show you the first
