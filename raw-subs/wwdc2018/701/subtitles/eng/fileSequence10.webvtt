00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:02.276 A:middle
We're then going to create a

00:10:02.276 --> 00:10:04.516 A:middle
mask from that sample and apply

00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:06.956 A:middle
it to the image.

00:10:07.436 --> 00:10:08.336 A:middle
Once we've done that, we're

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:09.576 A:middle
going to reconstruct the

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.176 A:middle
original image.

00:10:10.516 --> 00:10:11.826 A:middle
So let me walk you through some

00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:11.976 A:middle
code.

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:18.396 A:middle
We're going to do an FFT.

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:19.306 A:middle
This means it needs to be a

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:19.936 A:middle
power of 2.

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:21.236 A:middle
That's why you see the log2

00:10:21.236 --> 00:10:21.496 A:middle
call.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.796 A:middle
The 1024 x 1024 is the size of

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:25.226 A:middle
the image.

00:10:28.646 --> 00:10:30.106 A:middle
We're then going to pass it to

00:10:30.106 --> 00:10:30.846 A:middle
fft2d zrop.

00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:32.076 A:middle
This is quite a mouthful.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:33.976 A:middle
The important part here is the

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:35.616 A:middle
op stands for out of place.

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:36.746 A:middle
So we're going to have to create

00:10:36.746 --> 00:10:38.346 A:middle
some temporary space just for

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:38.756 A:middle
the result.

00:10:39.256 --> 00:10:42.876 A:middle
We're going to store in this

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.346 A:middle
complex structure, and

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:45.226 A:middle
effectively this says we're

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:46.176 A:middle
going to store the complex

00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:48.526 A:middle
number in two arrays with the

00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:49.926 A:middle
real component in one array and

00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:51.366 A:middle
the imaginary component in the

00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:51.866 A:middle
second.

00:10:52.856 --> 00:10:53.816 A:middle
We also need to specify a

00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:54.296 A:middle
direction.

00:10:54.746 --> 00:10:55.596 A:middle
In this case we're going to do a

00:10:55.596 --> 00:10:56.406 A:middle
forward FFT.
