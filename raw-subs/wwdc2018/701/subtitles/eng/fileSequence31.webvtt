00:30:59.836 --> 00:31:03.036 A:middle
call vImageRotate and given the

00:31:03.036 --> 00:31:05.006 A:middle
angle of rotation, it will do

00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:06.726 A:middle
counterclockwise or clockwise to

00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:07.956 A:middle
better align your images.

00:31:09.276 --> 00:31:11.766 A:middle
For the blur effect, we use

00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:12.536 A:middle
TentConvolve.

00:31:13.676 --> 00:31:15.066 A:middle
The blur effect is controlled by

00:31:15.066 --> 00:31:15.976 A:middle
the size of the kernel.

00:31:16.446 --> 00:31:18.086 A:middle
The larger the kernel, the more

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:19.746 A:middle
blur you'll get.

00:31:20.916 --> 00:31:22.996 A:middle
Dither effect is basically

00:31:22.996 --> 00:31:25.276 A:middle
converting an 8-bit image into a

00:31:25.276 --> 00:31:26.116 A:middle
1-bit image.

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:27.446 A:middle
At the same time, you can

00:31:27.446 --> 00:31:29.146 A:middle
specify a dithering algorithm.

00:31:29.736 --> 00:31:30.886 A:middle
In this case, we used the

00:31:30.966 --> 00:31:32.526 A:middle
Atkinson dithering algorithm.

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:37.646 A:middle
Color quantization, we used the

00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:39.706 A:middle
quantization level to create a

00:31:39.706 --> 00:31:41.536 A:middle
lookup table for the RGB

00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:43.976 A:middle
channel, and we call

00:31:44.076 --> 00:31:46.596 A:middle
vImageTableLookUp to apply this

00:31:46.596 --> 00:31:48.806 A:middle
table lookup to RGB channels to

00:31:48.966 --> 00:31:50.476 A:middle
limit the number of colors on

00:31:50.476 --> 00:31:50.816 A:middle
the screen.

00:31:52.106 --> 00:31:55.606 A:middle
Those are the four additional

00:31:55.606 --> 00:31:56.796 A:middle
effects I wanted to show you,

00:31:57.106 --> 00:31:59.416 A:middle
and I think now is a good time

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:00.986 A:middle
to move onto the next topic.
