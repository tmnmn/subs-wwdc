00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:01.536 A:middle
And this performance translates

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:02.956 A:middle
directly into energy savings.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.646 A:middle
So if you're an app developer

00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:06.696 A:middle
and you use the Accelerate

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:08.276 A:middle
framework, not only will your

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:09.876 A:middle
application run faster, but

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:10.816 A:middle
you'll also use less battery

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:11.146 A:middle
life.

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:12.776 A:middle
This means your users are going

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:13.676 A:middle
to have an overall better

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:13.976 A:middle
experience.

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:20.416 A:middle
Now, because we provide so many

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.496 A:middle
primitives, we find it useful to

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:24.186 A:middle
organize or group them into

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.406 A:middle
domain-specific libraries.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:28.676 A:middle
So, for instance, we group all

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:29.926 A:middle
the signal processing primitives

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:31.026 A:middle
under vDSP.

00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:33.256 A:middle
So, for instance, this would be

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:35.196 A:middle
your FFTs or your DFTs and your

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.636 A:middle
DCTs, your fast Fourier

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:37.956 A:middle
transforms, your discrete cosine

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:38.516 A:middle
transforms.

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:42.786 A:middle
VImage contains the image

00:02:42.786 --> 00:02:43.586 A:middle
processing primitives.

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:45.506 A:middle
If you're doing color space

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.976 A:middle
conversions, this is the library

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:49.836 A:middle
for you.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.056 A:middle
VForce contains vector versions

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.196 A:middle
of the transcendental functions.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.906 A:middle
So for instance sine and cosine.

00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:57.906 A:middle
We also have support for dense

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:00.596 A:middle
linear algebra as well as sparse
