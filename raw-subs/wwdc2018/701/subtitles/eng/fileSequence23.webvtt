00:23:00.136 --> 00:23:01.676 A:middle
So I want to bring out the

00:23:01.676 --> 00:23:02.316 A:middle
color.

00:23:02.586 --> 00:23:04.826 A:middle
What I can do is move this

00:23:04.826 --> 00:23:09.576 A:middle
slider to the right to make the

00:23:09.576 --> 00:23:11.586 A:middle
red really red and green really

00:23:11.586 --> 00:23:11.866 A:middle
green.

00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:15.706 A:middle
And on the other side, I have

00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:16.666 A:middle
white roses.

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:20.066 A:middle
I feel that the color of white

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:21.346 A:middle
roses is not that interesting to

00:23:21.346 --> 00:23:21.636 A:middle
me.

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:23.136 A:middle
I would like to direct the focus

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:24.916 A:middle
of my audience to the

00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:27.426 A:middle
composition and the contrast of

00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:28.056 A:middle
this image.

00:23:28.996 --> 00:23:32.386 A:middle
I can slide to the left to

00:23:32.386 --> 00:23:36.376 A:middle
desaturate the image to the

00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:38.586 A:middle
point that this becomes a black

00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:39.406 A:middle
and white image.

00:23:39.906 --> 00:23:41.636 A:middle
So now color is no more

00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:43.596 A:middle
distraction in this image, and

00:23:43.696 --> 00:23:45.126 A:middle
the viewer can focus on the

00:23:45.126 --> 00:23:46.826 A:middle
composition and contrast.

00:23:48.266 --> 00:23:50.976 A:middle
Okay. So, how do we do this?

00:23:56.046 --> 00:23:57.116 A:middle
There are several steps we need

00:23:57.116 --> 00:23:57.536 A:middle
to take.

00:23:57.876 --> 00:24:00.246 A:middle
First, of course, we have to get
