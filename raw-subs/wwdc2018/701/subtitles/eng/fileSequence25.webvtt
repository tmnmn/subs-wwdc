00:24:58.246 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
VImage matrix multiply takes the

00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:03.476 A:middle
preBias, in this case minus 128,

00:25:03.766 --> 00:25:06.786 A:middle
to remove the bias, and because

00:25:06.786 --> 00:25:08.276 A:middle
the saturation is [inaudible]

00:25:08.276 --> 00:25:10.466 A:middle
point and the image is an

00:25:10.466 --> 00:25:13.046 A:middle
integer, we want to convert this

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:14.746 A:middle
saturation value first into

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
fixed point format.

00:25:16.366 --> 00:25:18.256 A:middle
We chose Q12 as the fixed point

00:25:18.256 --> 00:25:20.026 A:middle
format, hence a divisor of

00:25:20.026 --> 00:25:21.236 A:middle
0x100.

00:25:21.776 --> 00:25:24.086 A:middle
And then we have the postBias

00:25:24.086 --> 00:25:26.336 A:middle
128 times the divisor, just to

00:25:26.336 --> 00:25:27.796 A:middle
put the bias back to the pixel.

00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:32.036 A:middle
And the matrix itself is really,

00:25:32.036 --> 00:25:32.626 A:middle
really simple.

00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:35.006 A:middle
All we want to do is just doing

00:25:35.006 --> 00:25:37.246 A:middle
a scaling of CbCr channel.

00:25:37.546 --> 00:25:39.016 A:middle
So the matrix itself is just a

00:25:39.016 --> 00:25:42.026 A:middle
scaler, want to multiply CbCr

00:25:42.026 --> 00:25:43.966 A:middle
channel with this scaler.

00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:47.126 A:middle
We have all the information, so

00:25:47.126 --> 00:25:49.026 A:middle
let's call vImageMatrixMultiply,

00:25:49.906 --> 00:25:51.906 A:middle
and with just one line of code,

00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:53.606 A:middle
one function call, you can

00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:56.126 A:middle
achieve the saturation effect.

00:25:56.906 --> 00:25:58.616 A:middle
Now let me come back to other

00:25:58.616 --> 00:25:59.746 A:middle
steps that we need to take.
