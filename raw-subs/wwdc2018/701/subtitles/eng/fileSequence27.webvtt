00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.346 A:middle
We do this for luminance and

00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:02.046 A:middle
chrominance channel.

00:27:03.586 --> 00:27:05.256 A:middle
Now we need to prepare an output

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:05.566 A:middle
buffer.

00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:08.496 A:middle
Remember, we don't have a piece

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:09.796 A:middle
of memory allocated to the

00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:11.736 A:middle
output image yet, so we need to

00:27:11.736 --> 00:27:13.776 A:middle
do that, and vImage has a

00:27:13.776 --> 00:27:15.446 A:middle
convenience function, vImage

00:27:15.446 --> 00:27:18.116 A:middle
buffer in it, to do just that.

00:27:18.756 --> 00:27:21.196 A:middle
Given this height, width, and

00:27:21.646 --> 00:27:24.906 A:middle
bits per pixel, vImage buffer in

00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:26.626 A:middle
it will allocate a memory that's

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:27.936 A:middle
large enough to hold this image

00:27:28.016 --> 00:27:29.516 A:middle
and then also create a vImage

00:27:29.556 --> 00:27:31.486 A:middle
buffer object so it can be

00:27:31.486 --> 00:27:33.286 A:middle
consumed by the vImage library.

00:27:33.756 --> 00:27:38.466 A:middle
Last step is put this process

00:27:38.856 --> 00:27:40.076 A:middle
image to the screen.

00:27:40.556 --> 00:27:46.596 A:middle
Like I said before, RGB is

00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:47.656 A:middle
really the best format for

00:27:47.656 --> 00:27:49.456 A:middle
display, so let's use the

00:27:49.456 --> 00:27:51.296 A:middle
conversion function to convert

00:27:51.296 --> 00:27:54.016 A:middle
YCbCr image into a RGB image.

00:27:54.316 --> 00:27:56.906 A:middle
And then because the UI expect

00:27:56.906 --> 00:27:59.196 A:middle
the cgImage object, we have to

00:27:59.196 --> 00:27:59.856 A:middle
create one.
