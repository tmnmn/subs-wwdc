00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:04.166 A:middle
First, in iOS 10.3 we introduced

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:06.016 A:middle
the SKStoreReviewController.

00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:08.586 A:middle
This is a powerful API and it

00:12:08.586 --> 00:12:10.986 A:middle
allows an app to give a quick

00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:12.796 A:middle
and easy prompt for the user to

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:14.706 A:middle
select a star rating or maybe

00:12:14.706 --> 00:12:16.076 A:middle
even type in a review and get

00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:17.926 A:middle
right back to using your app.

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:21.036 A:middle
But with great power comes

00:12:21.246 --> 00:12:22.246 A:middle
restrictions.

00:12:23.006 --> 00:12:25.836 A:middle
First, we limit the number of

00:12:25.836 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
times that this prompt can

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:30.466 A:middle
appear per app, per device and

00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:31.316 A:middle
per year.

00:12:32.866 --> 00:12:35.516 A:middle
Second, if users choose never to

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:37.556 A:middle
see these rating prompt they can

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:38.956 A:middle
just go into App Store settings

00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:40.286 A:middle
and disable them altogether.

00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:43.116 A:middle
So with those 2 restrictions in

00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:45.666 A:middle
mind what are some strategies

00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:46.936 A:middle
you want to use for when to

00:12:46.936 --> 00:12:49.296 A:middle
determine is the best time to

00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:51.186 A:middle
call into the review controller.

00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.486 A:middle
Well first and foremost, don't

00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:55.166 A:middle
interrupt.

00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:57.486 A:middle
If the user is in the middle of

00:12:57.486 --> 00:12:58.866 A:middle
playing that level and fighting

00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
the big boss at the end of it
