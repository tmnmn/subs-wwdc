00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.066 A:middle
So what do I mean by the

00:17:02.066 --> 00:17:03.036 A:middle
Sandbox?

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:05.906 A:middle
Well first what don't I mean,

00:17:05.996 --> 00:17:07.906 A:middle
I'm not talking about the app

00:17:07.906 --> 00:17:10.236 A:middle
Sandbox, that part of the

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:11.766 A:middle
operating system in kernel that

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:14.106 A:middle
limits what resources your apps

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:14.886 A:middle
have access to.

00:17:15.126 --> 00:17:16.435 A:middle
What I'm really talking about is

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:18.435 A:middle
a dedicated environment, it's an

00:17:18.435 --> 00:17:20.736 A:middle
entire copy of the App Store

00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:22.106 A:middle
commerce engine on the server

00:17:22.106 --> 00:17:24.106 A:middle
side that's there for you to

00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:26.016 A:middle
test your apps and in-app

00:17:26.016 --> 00:17:26.915 A:middle
purchases.

00:17:28.435 --> 00:17:31.076 A:middle
StoreKit knows when to go to the

00:17:31.076 --> 00:17:32.946 A:middle
Sandbox environment based on how

00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:34.036 A:middle
your app is signed.

00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:36.486 A:middle
So for example, you're building

00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:38.196 A:middle
your app in Xcode, it's signed

00:17:38.196 --> 00:17:39.946 A:middle
with the developer's certificate

00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:41.756 A:middle
StoreKit knows right then and

00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:43.526 A:middle
there take all of your requests

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:44.846 A:middle
to the Sandbox environment.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.996 A:middle
If the user downloads the app

00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.676 A:middle
from the production App Store in

00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:50.466 A:middle
that case it's going to be

00:17:50.466 --> 00:17:51.346 A:middle
production signed.

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.476 A:middle
StoreKit knows to go right to

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.016 A:middle
the regular production

00:17:55.016 --> 00:17:55.536 A:middle
environment.

00:17:56.916 --> 00:17:58.496 A:middle
So what makes the Sandbox

00:17:58.496 --> 00:17:59.386 A:middle
environment different?

00:17:59.386 --> 00:18:02.676 A:middle
Well first we don't charge, this
