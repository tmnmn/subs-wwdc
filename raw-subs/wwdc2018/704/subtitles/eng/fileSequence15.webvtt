00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.426 A:middle
base giving feedback.

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:03.286 A:middle
I hope this type of feedback

00:15:03.286 --> 00:15:04.566 A:middle
convinces you that you shouldn't

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:06.496 A:middle
be using your own prompts to

00:15:06.496 --> 00:15:07.606 A:middle
request review you should move

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:08.436 A:middle
over to the

00:15:08.436 --> 00:15:11.216 A:middle
SKStoreReviewController, it

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:12.326 A:middle
really has been making

00:15:12.326 --> 00:15:13.276 A:middle
tremendous gains.

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:18.056 A:middle
As I'm sure you saw yesterday,

00:15:18.576 --> 00:15:20.556 A:middle
we announced a beautiful new Mac

00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:22.646 A:middle
App Store and we know you guys

00:15:22.646 --> 00:15:23.676 A:middle
are all going to rush off and

00:15:23.676 --> 00:15:25.476 A:middle
make great new Mac apps.

00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:27.486 A:middle
And so with that we're excited

00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:29.056 A:middle
to announce that we brought the

00:15:29.056 --> 00:15:30.856 A:middle
write a review API to the Mac

00:15:31.136 --> 00:15:31.976 A:middle
starting with Mojave.

00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:36.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.136 A:middle
So I mentioned there were a few

00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:41.156 A:middle
ways you can get users to write

00:15:41.156 --> 00:15:42.716 A:middle
reviews for your apps.

00:15:44.226 --> 00:15:46.046 A:middle
Well another way of doing it is

00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:47.676 A:middle
you can deep link right into the

00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:48.436 A:middle
App Store.

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:50.636 A:middle
We also introduced this in iOS

00:15:50.636 --> 00:15:52.216 A:middle
10.3 and we're also bringing

00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:53.436 A:middle
that to the Mac this year.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.156 A:middle
It's basically just a link right

00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:57.816 A:middle
into your product page, you tell

00:15:57.816 --> 00:15:59.126 A:middle
the App Store bring up the write

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.886 A:middle
a review sheet and the user can
