You're going to take those 3

00:35:00.846 --> 00:35:03.826 A:middle
values, generate your SHA-1 hash

00:35:04.696 --> 00:35:07.126 A:middle
and compare and if it matches

00:35:07.846 --> 00:35:09.256 A:middle
what you generate with what's in

00:35:09.256 --> 00:35:10.776 A:middle
the receipt you know that that

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:12.786 A:middle
receipt was generated for your

00:35:12.786 --> 00:35:14.246 A:middle
app on that device.

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:18.406 A:middle
Well what happens if you get an

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:21.526 A:middle
invalid receipt or it just

00:35:21.526 --> 00:35:22.776 A:middle
doesn't exist for whatever

00:35:22.776 --> 00:35:23.276 A:middle
reason?

00:35:24.556 --> 00:35:26.676 A:middle
StoreKit gives you APIs to

00:35:26.876 --> 00:35:28.836 A:middle
request a new receipt from the

00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:29.466 A:middle
App Store.

00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:31.656 A:middle
Again, the receipt comes from

00:35:31.656 --> 00:35:33.616 A:middle
our commerce backend so you're

00:35:33.616 --> 00:35:35.806 A:middle
going to need a network in order

00:35:35.806 --> 00:35:36.686 A:middle
to be able to complete this

00:35:36.686 --> 00:35:37.426 A:middle
operation.

00:35:38.596 --> 00:35:41.586 A:middle
In order to make sure that we

00:35:41.586 --> 00:35:43.196 A:middle
are using an authentic receipt

00:35:43.196 --> 00:35:44.886 A:middle
from an authentic user a sign-in

00:35:44.886 --> 00:35:45.806 A:middle
may be required.

00:35:46.306 --> 00:35:49.806 A:middle
When you get an updated receipt

00:35:49.806 --> 00:35:51.526 A:middle
you need to be careful to avoid

00:35:51.526 --> 00:35:53.386 A:middle
any sort of continuous loop of

00:35:53.386 --> 00:35:54.586 A:middle
validate and refresh.

00:35:54.586 --> 00:35:55.916 A:middle
If you get an updated receipt

00:35:56.136 --> 00:35:57.836 A:middle
check it once and if it's still

00:35:57.836 --> 00:35:59.486 A:middle
invalid error out then.
