00:25:58.816 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
to Buy turned on, so Ask to Buy

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:02.766 A:middle
is a feature that allows parents

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.766 A:middle
to manually approve or decline

00:26:04.766 --> 00:26:05.856 A:middle
transactions made by their

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:06.236 A:middle
children.

00:26:07.596 --> 00:26:09.216 A:middle
Any user can have Ask to Buy set

00:26:09.216 --> 00:26:11.206 A:middle
up, but it can happen to any of

00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:12.386 A:middle
your in-app purchases so it is

00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:13.306 A:middle
important that you handle this

00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:13.976 A:middle
case appropriately.

00:26:18.046 --> 00:26:20.436 A:middle
Speaking of Ask to Buy, if your

00:26:20.436 --> 00:26:21.716 A:middle
transaction is deferred due to

00:26:21.716 --> 00:26:24.136 A:middle
Ask to Buy the user will receive

00:26:24.136 --> 00:26:25.206 A:middle
a message from the App Store

00:26:25.206 --> 00:26:26.306 A:middle
saying that their parent has

00:26:26.306 --> 00:26:28.406 A:middle
been notified to approve it.

00:26:29.236 --> 00:26:31.706 A:middle
If it is approved and then it

00:26:31.706 --> 00:26:32.786 A:middle
will be returned to your

00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:34.606 A:middle
Transaction Observer in the

00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:35.296 A:middle
purchased state.

00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:36.836 A:middle
You should let the user know

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:38.316 A:middle
it's been approved, of course

00:26:38.316 --> 00:26:39.786 A:middle
deliver the content, and call

00:26:39.786 --> 00:26:40.516 A:middle
Finish Transaction.

00:26:41.096 --> 00:26:44.396 A:middle
If it's declined it will be

00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:45.426 A:middle
returned to your Transaction

00:26:45.426 --> 00:26:46.456 A:middle
Observer in the failed state.

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:48.026 A:middle
So here you should let the user

00:26:48.026 --> 00:26:49.636 A:middle
know that it was declined and

00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:50.816 A:middle
then call Finish Transaction to

00:26:50.816 --> 00:26:51.246 A:middle
finish it up.

00:26:52.206 --> 00:26:55.736 A:middle
However, if there's no action

00:26:55.736 --> 00:26:58.346 A:middle
taken within 24 hours then the

00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:02.416 A:middle
transaction fails silently, this
