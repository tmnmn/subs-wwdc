00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:01.526 A:middle
So what does this look like in

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:01.886 A:middle
code?

00:36:02.846 --> 00:36:03.606 A:middle
You simply call

00:36:03.606 --> 00:36:06.416 A:middle
SKReceiptRefreshRequest, you set

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:08.526 A:middle
your purchase queue delegate

00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:09.266 A:middle
right there on the

00:36:09.266 --> 00:36:10.886 A:middle
ReceiptRefresh, you call start

00:36:11.186 --> 00:36:12.706 A:middle
and as that receipt gets updated

00:36:12.966 --> 00:36:14.176 A:middle
we'll call back and let you know

00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:14.846 A:middle
when it's down.

00:36:15.376 --> 00:36:19.546 A:middle
On macOS you can also call exit

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:23.176 A:middle
173, that 173 code will tell the

00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:24.486 A:middle
operating system and tell

00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:27.746 A:middle
StoreKit to refresh a receipt on

00:36:27.746 --> 00:36:28.156 A:middle
your behalf.

00:36:29.246 --> 00:36:30.066 A:middle
There the app will get

00:36:30.066 --> 00:36:31.596 A:middle
relaunched once a new receipt

00:36:31.596 --> 00:36:32.166 A:middle
comes down.

00:36:32.696 --> 00:36:36.156 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, we're

00:36:36.156 --> 00:36:38.156 A:middle
now allowing non-subscription

00:36:38.156 --> 00:36:39.736 A:middle
apps to do free trials and the

00:36:39.736 --> 00:36:41.406 A:middle
receipt is a great way to

00:36:41.406 --> 00:36:43.446 A:middle
understand is the user in the

00:36:43.446 --> 00:36:45.146 A:middle
middle of a free trial or have

00:36:45.146 --> 00:36:47.946 A:middle
they bought the full unlock

00:36:48.476 --> 00:36:49.656 A:middle
non-consumable IAP.

00:36:49.656 --> 00:36:53.016 A:middle
To do this you're going to want

00:36:53.016 --> 00:36:55.776 A:middle
to look for type 17 within the

00:36:55.776 --> 00:36:56.236 A:middle
receipt.

00:36:56.556 --> 00:36:58.156 A:middle
This includes all of your

00:36:58.286 --> 00:37:00.036 A:middle
subscription consumable and
