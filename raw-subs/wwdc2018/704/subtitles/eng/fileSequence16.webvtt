00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.886 A:middle
a review sheet and the user can

00:16:00.886 --> 00:16:01.786 A:middle
fill it out right then and

00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:02.036 A:middle
there.

00:16:02.196 --> 00:16:04.046 A:middle
As an alternative to the

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.606 A:middle
SKStoreReviewController this

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.386 A:middle
works much better from any sort

00:16:07.386 --> 00:16:09.056 A:middle
of UI you might have where the

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:10.626 A:middle
user has to take an immediate

00:16:10.626 --> 00:16:11.216 A:middle
action.

00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:13.856 A:middle
So for example, if you had a

00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:15.946 A:middle
button inside a settings page

00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:17.726 A:middle
within your app basically asking

00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:18.866 A:middle
the user to kindly write a

00:16:18.866 --> 00:16:20.576 A:middle
review this would be a great

00:16:20.576 --> 00:16:22.296 A:middle
time to use a deep link right

00:16:22.296 --> 00:16:23.406 A:middle
into your product page.

00:16:24.086 --> 00:16:24.986 A:middle
So how does this work?

00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:28.536 A:middle
Well pretty simple, you take

00:16:28.536 --> 00:16:30.326 A:middle
your product page URL and you

00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.406 A:middle
add action=write-review to the

00:16:32.406 --> 00:16:32.836 A:middle
end of it.

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:34.136 A:middle
This informs the App Store to

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.216 A:middle
bring right up the write a

00:16:35.216 --> 00:16:35.866 A:middle
review sheet.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.776 A:middle
If you don't know how to get a

00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:41.176 A:middle
product URL for your app

00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:44.316 A:middle
linkmaker.itunes.apple.com is a

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:46.356 A:middle
great facility for finding that.

00:16:46.446 --> 00:16:47.166 A:middle
You can get a lot more

00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:48.536 A:middle
information about ratings and

00:16:48.536 --> 00:16:49.686 A:middle
reviews, including how to

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.596 A:middle
respond to your customer reviews

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:53.106 A:middle
right on the developer website.

00:16:53.636 --> 00:16:57.776 A:middle
I'd like to do a deep dive into

00:16:58.006 --> 00:16:59.676 A:middle
the App Store Sandbox next.
