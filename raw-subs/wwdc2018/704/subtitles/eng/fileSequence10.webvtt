00:09:58.636 --> 00:10:00.246 A:middle
sense for your app and your

00:10:00.246 --> 00:10:01.946 A:middle
app's business model to offer a

00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
subscription service?

00:10:03.966 --> 00:10:06.986 A:middle
Well, starting today we're

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:08.006 A:middle
excited to announce that you can

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:09.476 A:middle
offer free trials for

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:11.086 A:middle
non-subscription based apps.

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:12.936 A:middle
This will allow you to have a

00:10:12.936 --> 00:10:14.506 A:middle
try before you can buy

00:10:14.506 --> 00:10:15.436 A:middle
experience.

00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:18.606 A:middle
So how do you do this?

00:10:19.746 --> 00:10:22.796 A:middle
Well you take your payUpFront

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:25.306 A:middle
app and you make it free in the

00:10:25.306 --> 00:10:26.106 A:middle
App Store.

00:10:26.946 --> 00:10:28.096 A:middle
And then you add a

00:10:28.096 --> 00:10:30.086 A:middle
non-consumable in-app purchase

00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:30.656 A:middle
to unlock.

00:10:30.656 --> 00:10:32.456 A:middle
So if your app is 9.99 in the

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:33.426 A:middle
App Store you're going to want

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:35.336 A:middle
to make a non-consumable in-app

00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:37.156 A:middle
purchase of 9.99.

00:10:38.486 --> 00:10:39.446 A:middle
But it's important to let the

00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:41.456 A:middle
user decide when to begin the

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:43.976 A:middle
trial period, so to do that you

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.176 A:middle
need to make a second

00:10:45.796 --> 00:10:47.406 A:middle
non-consumable in-app purchase

00:10:47.406 --> 00:10:48.656 A:middle
at price tier 0.

00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:50.006 A:middle
This will be a free

00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:52.636 A:middle
non-consumable that the user

00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:54.576 A:middle
will use to begin their trial

00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:55.026 A:middle
period.

00:10:56.216 --> 00:10:57.856 A:middle
The naming convention of that

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:00.486 A:middle
free non-consumable should
