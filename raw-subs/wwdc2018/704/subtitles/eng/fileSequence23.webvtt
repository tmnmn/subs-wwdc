00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:00.676 A:middle
transaction until you add the

00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:01.576 A:middle
Transaction Observer.

00:23:01.746 --> 00:23:03.446 A:middle
If the user decides to buy

00:23:03.446 --> 00:23:04.676 A:middle
something else this could result

00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:05.846 A:middle
in confusion when they receive

00:23:05.846 --> 00:23:08.156 A:middle
two prompts or they could

00:23:08.156 --> 00:23:09.346 A:middle
receive a prompt out of nowhere

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.416 A:middle
when you finally add the

00:23:10.416 --> 00:23:12.666 A:middle
Transaction Observer again.

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:14.926 A:middle
Not great [inaudible].

00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:16.156 A:middle
Another common case where the

00:23:16.156 --> 00:23:17.176 A:middle
user needs to leave your app in

00:23:17.176 --> 00:23:18.216 A:middle
the middle of a transaction is

00:23:18.216 --> 00:23:18.886 A:middle
if they have to edit their

00:23:18.886 --> 00:23:20.456 A:middle
billing info, this happens all

00:23:20.456 --> 00:23:20.816 A:middle
the time.

00:23:21.156 --> 00:23:22.086 A:middle
You'd have to leave your app and

00:23:22.086 --> 00:23:22.816 A:middle
you want to make sure to

00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:23.596 A:middle
smoothly continue the

00:23:23.596 --> 00:23:24.806 A:middle
transaction when they do return.

00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:29.276 A:middle
Finally, it happens your app can

00:23:29.276 --> 00:23:31.016 A:middle
crash, in this case you want to

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:32.466 A:middle
make sure to smoothly continue

00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:32.886 A:middle
as well.

00:23:33.426 --> 00:23:37.026 A:middle
Now there are some other reason

00:23:37.026 --> 00:23:38.316 A:middle
as well that you want to make

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:39.286 A:middle
sure to add this as early as

00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:39.766 A:middle
possible.

00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:41.806 A:middle
There are several types of

00:23:41.806 --> 00:23:43.246 A:middle
transactions that can actually

00:23:43.246 --> 00:23:44.016 A:middle
come from outside your app.

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:46.266 A:middle
For example subscription

00:23:46.266 --> 00:23:47.076 A:middle
renewals come through the

00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:47.956 A:middle
Transaction Observer.

00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:50.726 A:middle
When an auto renewable renews

00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:52.236 A:middle
successfully you'll receive a

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:53.426 A:middle
transaction in the payment

00:23:53.426 --> 00:23:53.616 A:middle
queue.

00:23:53.756 --> 00:23:56.066 A:middle
You definitely want to make sure

00:23:56.066 --> 00:23:57.246 A:middle
to receive this as early as

00:23:57.246 --> 00:23:58.346 A:middle
possible so you don't interrupt

00:23:58.346 --> 00:23:59.636 A:middle
the user's service when they

00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:02.866 A:middle
actually have paid for it.
