00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.836 A:middle
subscription purchase you'll

00:20:00.836 --> 00:20:02.886 A:middle
have 5 automatic auto renews

00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:04.826 A:middle
working up this cadence and at

00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:05.976 A:middle
the end it'll just stop.

00:20:06.096 --> 00:20:07.996 A:middle
This is to simulate what would

00:20:07.996 --> 00:20:09.166 A:middle
happen if a user goes into

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.726 A:middle
managed accounts and disables

00:20:10.726 --> 00:20:11.716 A:middle
that subscription, they just

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.926 A:middle
turn it off or what we call

00:20:13.926 --> 00:20:15.726 A:middle
voluntary turn, they've decided

00:20:15.726 --> 00:20:16.516 A:middle
they don't want to use your

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:17.366 A:middle
service anymore.

00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:21.486 A:middle
So how do set all this up, how

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:22.656 A:middle
do you work with the Sandbox

00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:23.106 A:middle
environment?

00:20:23.106 --> 00:20:24.276 A:middle
Well first you go into App Store

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:26.576 A:middle
Connect, you create your users.

00:20:27.076 --> 00:20:29.666 A:middle
You create your products that

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:30.806 A:middle
you're going to sell, you're

00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:31.846 A:middle
going to need to get that up on

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:33.156 A:middle
the server side before your app

00:20:33.156 --> 00:20:34.236 A:middle
starts working with that.

00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:36.656 A:middle
You build and sign your app in

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:37.896 A:middle
Xcode just like you do all the

00:20:37.896 --> 00:20:38.336 A:middle
time.

00:20:39.086 --> 00:20:40.346 A:middle
And you launch your app and you

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:41.646 A:middle
go find a product to buy.

00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:44.386 A:middle
And then when prompted you sign

00:20:44.386 --> 00:20:45.586 A:middle
in with your Sandbox account.

00:20:46.076 --> 00:20:48.866 A:middle
Now if you're paying attention

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:50.426 A:middle
you might have thought I missed

00:20:50.426 --> 00:20:51.206 A:middle
a step.

00:20:51.816 --> 00:20:53.946 A:middle
What would happen if I'm already

00:20:53.946 --> 00:20:56.206 A:middle
signed in to my production app

00:20:56.606 --> 00:20:58.706 A:middle
or iTunes Store, don't I need to

00:20:58.706 --> 00:21:00.676 A:middle
sign out before using a Sandbox
