00:37:59.196 --> 00:38:01.006 A:middle
to it.

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:03.336 A:middle
Alternatively, if you find a

00:38:03.776 --> 00:38:05.436 A:middle
Free Trial Product Identifier,

00:38:05.436 --> 00:38:06.526 A:middle
the product identifier that

00:38:06.526 --> 00:38:08.046 A:middle
represents the user beginning

00:38:08.046 --> 00:38:09.486 A:middle
their free trial you're going to

00:38:09.486 --> 00:38:10.496 A:middle
want to look at the purchase

00:38:10.526 --> 00:38:11.976 A:middle
date associated with that free

00:38:11.976 --> 00:38:12.426 A:middle
trial.

00:38:13.646 --> 00:38:14.556 A:middle
Here's where things get a little

00:38:14.556 --> 00:38:15.016 A:middle
tricky.

00:38:15.986 --> 00:38:17.476 A:middle
You can't always trust the clock

00:38:17.476 --> 00:38:18.826 A:middle
on the device, again the user

00:38:18.826 --> 00:38:19.556 A:middle
can change that.

00:38:19.556 --> 00:38:20.616 A:middle
So you might want to use your

00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:22.416 A:middle
own backend server or some sort

00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:24.406 A:middle
of time server to make sure that

00:38:24.406 --> 00:38:25.586 A:middle
it's still within your free

00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:26.526 A:middle
trial period.

00:38:27.636 --> 00:38:29.876 A:middle
There's also device check APIs

00:38:30.086 --> 00:38:30.946 A:middle
which I highly recommend you

00:38:30.946 --> 00:38:31.946 A:middle
check out that help you

00:38:32.106 --> 00:38:33.776 A:middle
determine whether or not the

00:38:33.776 --> 00:38:35.436 A:middle
user has previously completed

00:38:35.436 --> 00:38:37.016 A:middle
their free trial window on that

00:38:37.056 --> 00:38:37.716 A:middle
device.

00:38:39.416 --> 00:38:41.206 A:middle
Lastly, if neither are present

00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:43.456 A:middle
this is your signal to display

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:46.956 A:middle
that free trial upsell to begin

00:38:46.956 --> 00:38:48.116 A:middle
the free trial, but again you

00:38:48.116 --> 00:38:49.276 A:middle
need to be careful to make sure

00:38:49.276 --> 00:38:51.066 A:middle
you represent the length of that

00:38:51.066 --> 00:38:52.936 A:middle
free trial, the content that

00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:54.116 A:middle
they're going to lose if they

00:38:54.286 --> 00:38:56.766 A:middle
don't buy that Full Unlock, and

00:38:56.766 --> 00:38:58.206 A:middle
the ultimate price of the Full

00:38:58.206 --> 00:38:58.656 A:middle
Unlock.
