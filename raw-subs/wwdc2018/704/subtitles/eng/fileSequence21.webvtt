sign out before using a Sandbox

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.046 A:middle
account?

00:21:01.816 --> 00:21:03.316 A:middle
Well starting in iOS 12 that's

00:21:03.316 --> 00:21:04.546 A:middle
no longer the case.

Down here we've separated out

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.196 A:middle
your production account from

00:21:15.196 --> 00:21:16.426 A:middle
your Sandbox account, you can

00:21:16.426 --> 00:21:18.176 A:middle
manage it separately just like

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.736 A:middle
how we use the receipt to decide

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:21.366 A:middle
which environment to use we use

00:21:21.366 --> 00:21:22.906 A:middle
the -- I'm sorry, just like we

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.616 A:middle
use the certificate to know

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.286 A:middle
which environment to use we know

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.926 A:middle
to use the Sandbox account when

00:21:28.926 --> 00:21:30.086 A:middle
you're in development mode.

00:21:30.896 --> 00:21:32.056 A:middle
So look forward to that in iOS

00:21:32.056 --> 00:21:33.006 A:middle
12 I think it's going to make a

00:21:33.006 --> 00:21:34.466 A:middle
huge difference for carrying

00:21:34.466 --> 00:21:35.866 A:middle
these test apps on your personal

00:21:35.866 --> 00:21:37.646 A:middle
devices for long-term testing.

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:41.156 A:middle
So now I'm going to invite Ross

00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:42.076 A:middle
back up and he's going to talk

00:21:42.076 --> 00:21:43.756 A:middle
about some best practices, some

00:21:43.756 --> 00:21:45.056 A:middle
things you want to keep in mind

00:21:45.056 --> 00:21:45.846 A:middle
when processing your

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:46.826 A:middle
transactions.

00:21:47.236 --> 00:21:47.626 A:middle
Ross.

00:21:55.256 --> 00:21:56.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I would like to go over a few

00:21:56.576 --> 00:21:57.876 A:middle
common questions and scenarios

00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.106 A:middle
we see and discuss the best way

00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:00.856 A:middle
to handle them.
