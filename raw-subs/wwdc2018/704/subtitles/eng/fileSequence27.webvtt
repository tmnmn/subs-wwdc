00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:02.416 A:middle
transaction fails silently, this

00:27:02.416 --> 00:27:03.486 A:middle
means that nothing will be

00:27:03.486 --> 00:27:04.566 A:middle
returned to your Transaction

00:27:04.566 --> 00:27:04.916 A:middle
Observer.

00:27:05.686 --> 00:27:07.946 A:middle
Furthermore, all Ask to Buy

00:27:07.946 --> 00:27:09.416 A:middle
transactions within that 24

00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:11.036 A:middle
hours are consolidated into a

00:27:11.036 --> 00:27:12.886 A:middle
single ask.

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:14.486 A:middle
So the important takeaway here

00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.756 A:middle
is that you should not wait on

00:27:15.756 --> 00:27:17.486 A:middle
deferred transactions or even

00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:18.646 A:middle
expect them to come back at all,

00:27:18.826 --> 00:27:19.946 A:middle
you should make sure you don't

00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:21.176 A:middle
lock the UI and allow the user

00:27:21.176 --> 00:27:22.546 A:middle
to continue using your app as

00:27:22.546 --> 00:27:24.666 A:middle
much as possible.

00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:26.106 A:middle
Another important tip when

00:27:26.106 --> 00:27:27.756 A:middle
working with in-app purchases

00:27:27.756 --> 00:27:29.326 A:middle
that have Apple hosted content

00:27:29.326 --> 00:27:31.096 A:middle
via SKDownload is that you

00:27:31.096 --> 00:27:32.346 A:middle
should always finish downloading

00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:34.246 A:middle
the hosted content before

00:27:34.246 --> 00:27:35.356 A:middle
calling Finish Transaction.

00:27:36.616 --> 00:27:37.996 A:middle
This is because once you call

00:27:37.996 --> 00:27:39.556 A:middle
Finish Transaction all

00:27:39.696 --> 00:27:41.766 A:middle
SKDownloads will be canceled and

00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:42.896 A:middle
no longer valid for

00:27:42.896 --> 00:27:43.436 A:middle
redownloading.

00:27:44.256 --> 00:27:45.826 A:middle
If you do this on accident then

00:27:45.826 --> 00:27:47.066 A:middle
you have to call Restore

00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:48.146 A:middle
Transactions to get a new

00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:49.016 A:middle
download to finish.

00:27:49.346 --> 00:27:51.056 A:middle
So even if your download fails

00:27:51.786 --> 00:27:53.116 A:middle
you should withhold calling

00:27:53.116 --> 00:27:54.656 A:middle
Finish Transaction until you

00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:55.726 A:middle
retry it and you actually

00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:56.996 A:middle
successfully download it and

00:27:56.996 --> 00:27:58.016 A:middle
deliver that content to the

00:27:58.016 --> 00:27:58.316 A:middle
user.
