00:05:57.446 --> 00:06:00.176 A:middle
price that renews twice at 1.99

00:06:00.176 --> 00:06:00.536 A:middle
each.

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:03.596 A:middle
The billing period would look

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.716 A:middle
like this, the user purchases

00:06:05.716 --> 00:06:07.046 A:middle
the subscription at the

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:09.446 A:middle
introductory price of 1.99 and

00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:11.036 A:middle
receives 3 months of access.

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:13.166 A:middle
After that they can renew at

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:15.106 A:middle
1.99 for another 3 months of

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:15.596 A:middle
access.

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.236 A:middle
When that's over they'll renew

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:19.416 A:middle
at the normal subscription terms

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:20.756 A:middle
of 9.99 for 3 months.

00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:23.856 A:middle
Here's what the data from

00:06:23.856 --> 00:06:25.326 A:middle
StoreKit would look like in this

00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:25.706 A:middle
case.

00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:27.536 A:middle
You can see the

00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:28.826 A:middle
subscriptionPeriod has a unit of

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:30.636 A:middle
month and the number of units is

00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:32.426 A:middle
3, so it'll renew every 3 months

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:32.606 A:middle
number.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:34.486 A:middle
And then the numberOfPeriods is

00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:35.726 A:middle
2 giving us that total of 6

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:36.516 A:middle
months of introductory.

00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:39.426 A:middle
The payment mode is payAsYouGo.

00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:40.376 A:middle
And the price for the

00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:41.976 A:middle
introductory price is 1.99.

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.276 A:middle
The next payment mode is

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:47.926 A:middle
payUpFront.

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:50.846 A:middle
With this type of introductory

00:06:50.846 --> 00:06:52.206 A:middle
price the user pays just one

00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:53.336 A:middle
time and receives the entire

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:54.246 A:middle
introductory duration.

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:57.436 A:middle
This is not limited to multiples

00:06:57.436 --> 00:06:58.536 A:middle
of your subscriptions renewal

00:06:58.536 --> 00:06:58.876 A:middle
period.

00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:00.326 A:middle
So in this case, you could have
