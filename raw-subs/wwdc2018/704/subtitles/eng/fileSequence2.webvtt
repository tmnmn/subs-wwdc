00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:00.266 A:middle
receipt.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:04.066 A:middle
So to begin here's my colleague

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:04.556 A:middle
Ross.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.515 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Dana.

00:02:09.686 --> 00:02:13.256 A:middle
In iOS 11.2 and macOS 10.13.2 we

00:02:13.256 --> 00:02:14.466 A:middle
added the Introductory Pricing

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:15.506 A:middle
feature to in-app purchase

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:16.086 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:17.946 A:middle
This allows you to create a

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:19.446 A:middle
one-time use discount for new

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:20.136 A:middle
subscribers.

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:23.286 A:middle
We set up introductory pricing

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:25.736 A:middle
in App Store Connect and each

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:26.776 A:middle
subscription can only have a

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:28.186 A:middle
single introductory price at a

00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:28.846 A:middle
time.

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:30.656 A:middle
When an eligible user purchases

00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:33.056 A:middle
the subscription in your app the

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:33.936 A:middle
discount is applied

00:02:33.936 --> 00:02:35.376 A:middle
automatically by the App Store.

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:37.536 A:middle
Each user is eligible for a

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:39.356 A:middle
single introductory price based

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:40.346 A:middle
on the subscription group.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.646 A:middle
I'll go into that a little bit

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:43.906 A:middle
more later.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:45.366 A:middle
Along with Introductory Pricing

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.046 A:middle
we added several new types and

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:47.926 A:middle
properties in StoreKit.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:50.766 A:middle
These APIs reflect the data that

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:51.646 A:middle
you've set up in App Store

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:54.186 A:middle
Connect and you can use them to

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.946 A:middle
format your UI to display the

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.186 A:middle
terms of the subscription to

00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:59.156 A:middle
your users, as well as to

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.616 A:middle
determine which users are
