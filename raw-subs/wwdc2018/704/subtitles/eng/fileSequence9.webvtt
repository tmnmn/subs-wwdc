00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.136 A:middle
Now it wouldn't really make

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:02.326 A:middle
sense for a user to receive an

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:03.506 A:middle
introductory price to both the

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:05.176 A:middle
monthly and the yearly option

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:05.976 A:middle
for exact same content.

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:10.876 A:middle
Since introductory prices are

00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:12.326 A:middle
applied automatically by the App

00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:13.426 A:middle
Store at the time of purchase

00:09:13.826 --> 00:09:14.756 A:middle
it's important that your app

00:09:14.756 --> 00:09:16.196 A:middle
correctly determines the user's

00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:18.506 A:middle
eligibility when displaying the

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:19.216 A:middle
price.

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.186 A:middle
For more information about

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.946 A:middle
determining eligibility you can

00:09:21.946 --> 00:09:23.236 A:middle
see the engineering subscription

00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:24.526 A:middle
session which is just after this

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:25.196 A:middle
one at 3 o'clock.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:28.546 A:middle
Now with these new APIs you'll

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:29.636 A:middle
have access to all the

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.776 A:middle
information you've set up in App

00:09:30.776 --> 00:09:31.466 A:middle
Store Connect for your

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:33.136 A:middle
subscriptions, so your app can

00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:34.356 A:middle
reflect any changes you make

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:35.806 A:middle
without updates to your binary

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:36.686 A:middle
or to your server code.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:39.836 A:middle
I'd like to invite Dana back on

00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:41.276 A:middle
who has a few tips and

00:09:41.276 --> 00:09:41.976 A:middle
improvements for you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Ross, so

00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:51.736 A:middle
Introductory Pricing is a great

00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:54.836 A:middle
way to attract new customers if

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:55.806 A:middle
your business model is a

00:09:55.806 --> 00:09:56.476 A:middle
subscription.

00:09:57.086 --> 00:09:58.636 A:middle
But what if it doesn't make

00:09:58.636 --> 00:10:00.246 A:middle
sense for your app and your
