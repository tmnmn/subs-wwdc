00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:00.326 A:middle
So in this case, you could have

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:02.496 A:middle
a 1-year renewing subscription

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:04.206 A:middle
and offer a 1-month introductory

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:04.606 A:middle
price.

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:08.086 A:middle
So if we can take our previous

00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:10.106 A:middle
example of our 3-month auto

00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:11.706 A:middle
renewable subscription, this

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:14.426 A:middle
time we'll offer a payUpFront

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:15.846 A:middle
introductory price for 6 months.

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:19.666 A:middle
Charging 3.99, so it's about the

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:20.846 A:middle
same overall cost as the

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:22.476 A:middle
previous example, but this time

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:24.416 A:middle
the user will pay 3.99 upfront

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:25.986 A:middle
and receive the entire 6 months.

00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:28.806 A:middle
After that's up we'll renew with

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:29.616 A:middle
the normal terms of the

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.826 A:middle
subscription at 9.99 for every 3

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:31.976 A:middle
months.

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:36.556 A:middle
Here's what the data from

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:37.386 A:middle
StoreKit would look like in this

00:07:37.386 --> 00:07:37.766 A:middle
case.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.736 A:middle
The subscriptionPeriod's unit is

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:41.126 A:middle
still month, but this time we

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:42.046 A:middle
have 6 units.

00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:44.566 A:middle
The numberOfPeriods is 1 because

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:45.816 A:middle
it's a payUpFront introductory

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:45.976 A:middle
price.

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:52.446 A:middle
The final payment mode is

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:52.986 A:middle
freeTrial.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:55.436 A:middle
This behaves the same as the old

00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:56.886 A:middle
freeTrial behavior where the

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:57.896 A:middle
user pays nothing and receives

00:07:57.896 --> 00:07:58.796 A:middle
the entire introductory

00:07:58.796 --> 00:07:59.156 A:middle
duration.
