Finally, if you're using Receipt

00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:05.006 A:middle
Verification you should always

00:28:05.006 --> 00:28:06.496 A:middle
make sure to do this before

00:28:06.496 --> 00:28:07.586 A:middle
calling Finish Transaction as

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:07.816 A:middle
well.

00:28:08.806 --> 00:28:09.996 A:middle
This is especially important for

00:28:09.996 --> 00:28:11.306 A:middle
consumable in-app purchases

00:28:11.306 --> 00:28:12.756 A:middle
because consumable in-app

00:28:12.756 --> 00:28:14.286 A:middle
purchases only appear in receipt

00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:15.936 A:middle
as long as they're unfinished.

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:17.516 A:middle
Once you do call Finish

00:28:17.516 --> 00:28:18.856 A:middle
Transaction they will no longer

00:28:18.946 --> 00:28:19.986 A:middle
appear in their seats and you

00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:21.016 A:middle
won't be able to validate them.

00:28:21.316 --> 00:28:22.686 A:middle
So if you're using Receipt

00:28:22.686 --> 00:28:24.416 A:middle
Verification make sure that it's

00:28:24.416 --> 00:28:26.046 A:middle
a real Apple signed transaction

00:28:26.046 --> 00:28:27.976 A:middle
the user paid for, always do

00:28:27.976 --> 00:28:29.016 A:middle
this before calling Finish

00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:29.556 A:middle
Transaction.

00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:32.916 A:middle
I'd like to hand it back to Dana

00:28:32.916 --> 00:28:34.036 A:middle
to discuss some tips for

00:28:34.036 --> 00:28:34.696 A:middle
managing the receipt.

00:28:36.516 --> 00:28:39.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:41.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks again Ross.

00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:44.836 A:middle
So what is the receipt?

00:28:46.006 --> 00:28:46.846 A:middle
It's a lot like its name

00:28:46.846 --> 00:28:49.016 A:middle
implies, it is a record of your

00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:50.336 A:middle
app in in-app purchases.

00:28:50.336 --> 00:28:51.476 A:middle
It's a lot like the piece of

00:28:51.476 --> 00:28:53.216 A:middle
paper you get when you buy some

00:28:53.216 --> 00:28:54.006 A:middle
retail good.

00:28:54.556 --> 00:28:57.716 A:middle
It's stored on the device, it's

00:28:57.716 --> 00:28:59.096 A:middle
a file, it's a file that we

00:28:59.096 --> 00:29:00.676 A:middle
actually get from the App Store.
