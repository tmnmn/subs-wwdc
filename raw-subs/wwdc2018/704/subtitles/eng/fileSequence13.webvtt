00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
the big boss at the end of it

00:13:01.036 --> 00:13:02.386 A:middle
it's not a great time to ask

00:13:02.386 --> 00:13:04.516 A:middle
them to rate your game, wait

00:13:04.516 --> 00:13:05.156 A:middle
until they're done.

00:13:05.676 --> 00:13:09.186 A:middle
You should also wait until both

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:10.876 A:middle
they've had enough experience

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:12.276 A:middle
with your app to actually have a

00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:14.196 A:middle
good opinion about it, as well

00:13:14.196 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
as wait until they've had a

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.236 A:middle
positive experience.

00:13:16.236 --> 00:13:17.516 A:middle
Maybe they just finished

00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:19.216 A:middle
fighting that boss, maybe they

00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:20.616 A:middle
just ordered food and it got

00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:22.126 A:middle
delivered through your app, wait

00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:23.856 A:middle
until that positive experience.

00:13:25.196 --> 00:13:26.376 A:middle
Finally, I mentioned before that

00:13:26.376 --> 00:13:28.746 A:middle
we limit the number of times we

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:30.666 A:middle
will prompt this review her app,

00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:33.046 A:middle
per device, per year, but that

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.206 A:middle
doesn't mean we do any sort of

00:13:34.206 --> 00:13:34.876 A:middle
rate limiting.

00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:37.906 A:middle
So if within one session you

00:13:37.906 --> 00:13:39.886 A:middle
call the SKStoreReviewController

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:42.046 A:middle
3 times and the user keeps

00:13:42.046 --> 00:13:44.006 A:middle
clicking not now they will see

00:13:44.006 --> 00:13:45.486 A:middle
that 3 times in a row.

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:47.316 A:middle
It's up to you to add your own

00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:49.186 A:middle
rate limiting to your app.

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:50.706 A:middle
So how does this look in code?

00:13:51.826 --> 00:13:54.556 A:middle
Well as I've been saying, wrap

00:13:54.556 --> 00:13:55.216 A:middle
any call to the

00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:56.396 A:middle
StoreReviewController around

00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.096 A:middle
your own app's business logic.

00:13:58.396 --> 00:13:59.286 A:middle
Here's what you're going to want

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:00.946 A:middle
to check, is this a good time to
