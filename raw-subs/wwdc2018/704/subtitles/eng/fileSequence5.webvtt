00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:00.906 A:middle
Say if you have that 2-month

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:02.516 A:middle
introductory price, the number

00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:03.996 A:middle
of periods is 3, that means the

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.146 A:middle
introductory price is valid for

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:05.916 A:middle
a total of 6 months.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:11.606 A:middle
Finally, on SKProductDiscount

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:14.286 A:middle
there's a payment mode property.

00:05:15.286 --> 00:05:16.576 A:middle
This is another new enum that

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:17.496 A:middle
has three values.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.496 A:middle
The first value is payAsYouGo,

00:05:21.716 --> 00:05:22.586 A:middle
this behaves like a normal

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:24.416 A:middle
subscription where the user pays

00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:25.576 A:middle
once per renewal period.

00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:28.416 A:middle
The renewal period for these

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:29.766 A:middle
does have to be the same as the

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:30.816 A:middle
renewal period of the base

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:31.766 A:middle
subscription you've set up the

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:32.736 A:middle
introductory price on.

00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:35.466 A:middle
So if you had a month-long

00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.216 A:middle
subscription you couldn't have a

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:38.506 A:middle
2-week long introductory price

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:39.036 A:middle
in this case.

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.886 A:middle
You can use these types of

00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:43.176 A:middle
introductory prices to offer

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.246 A:middle
your users a longer introductory

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:46.716 A:middle
duration but with less friction

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:48.746 A:middle
up front.

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:51.116 A:middle
For example, if you have a

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.796 A:middle
3-month renewing subscription

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:56.096 A:middle
that's billed at 9.99 you could

00:05:56.096 --> 00:05:57.446 A:middle
set up a 6-month introductory

00:05:57.446 --> 00:06:00.176 A:middle
price that renews twice at 1.99
