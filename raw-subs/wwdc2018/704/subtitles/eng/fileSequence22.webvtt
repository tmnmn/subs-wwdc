00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:00.856 A:middle
to handle them.

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:02.756 A:middle
First things first, you should

00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:04.236 A:middle
add your Transaction Observer to

00:22:04.236 --> 00:22:05.576 A:middle
the default gaming queue as

00:22:05.636 --> 00:22:06.806 A:middle
early as possible in the life

00:22:06.806 --> 00:22:08.066 A:middle
cycle of your app.

00:22:09.456 --> 00:22:10.956 A:middle
This is a common issue we see

00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:12.176 A:middle
where apps don't add a

00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:13.416 A:middle
Transaction Observer until the

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.616 A:middle
user navigates to the in-app

00:22:14.656 --> 00:22:16.216 A:middle
purchase UI or even until they

00:22:16.216 --> 00:22:17.136 A:middle
begin a transaction.

00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:19.996 A:middle
In fact we recommend adding it

00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:21.586 A:middle
right in the application

00:22:21.586 --> 00:22:22.336 A:middle
didFinishLaunching

00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:23.316 A:middle
WithOptions method of your

00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:23.866 A:middle
AppDelegate.

00:22:25.616 --> 00:22:26.946 A:middle
Well why we recommend this.

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:29.016 A:middle
Well the Transaction Observer is

00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:30.276 A:middle
StoreKit's way of communicating

00:22:30.276 --> 00:22:32.366 A:middle
changes in transactions the user

00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:34.186 A:middle
is making in their app and

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.236 A:middle
pretty much all of these changes

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:35.726 A:middle
are important.

00:22:35.726 --> 00:22:37.636 A:middle
And it's a good user experience

00:22:37.636 --> 00:22:38.796 A:middle
and generally good business to

00:22:38.796 --> 00:22:39.706 A:middle
make sure you handle any

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:40.736 A:middle
transaction promptly.

00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:43.776 A:middle
There are a few cases when

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:44.656 A:middle
transactions can become

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:45.146 A:middle
interrupted.

00:22:46.426 --> 00:22:47.626 A:middle
For example, if the user leaves

00:22:47.626 --> 00:22:48.356 A:middle
your app in the middle of a

00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:49.846 A:middle
transaction, maybe they got

00:22:49.846 --> 00:22:51.076 A:middle
caught playing games in class.

00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:53.526 A:middle
Your app could be terminated by

00:22:53.526 --> 00:22:55.076 A:middle
the system later on or even by

00:22:55.076 --> 00:22:56.886 A:middle
the user and then when it's

00:22:56.886 --> 00:22:58.456 A:middle
opened back up again StoreKit

00:22:58.456 --> 00:22:59.346 A:middle
won't know to continue the

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:00.676 A:middle
transaction until you add the
