00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.616 A:middle
determine which users are

00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:01.676 A:middle
eligible for the introductory

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:02.156 A:middle
prices.

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
For example, here's what it

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.696 A:middle
looks like in the App Store when

00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:08.996 A:middle
you set up an introductory price

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:10.456 A:middle
on a promoted in-app purchase.

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:12.796 A:middle
You can see that it clearly

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.646 A:middle
naturally lays out the terms of

00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:15.726 A:middle
the subscription to the user,

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:18.586 A:middle
the first year for 19.99, then

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:21.006 A:middle
39.99 for each year after that.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:23.016 A:middle
This is also a great benefit of

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:24.106 A:middle
promoting your in-app purchases

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:25.236 A:middle
that have introductory prices.

00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:26.716 A:middle
Users can see the discount

00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:27.696 A:middle
before they even install your

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:28.486 A:middle
app.

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:30.696 A:middle
Today I'm going to go over these

00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:32.336 A:middle
new APIs with you and look at a

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:33.386 A:middle
couple ways you may want to set

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:36.616 A:middle
up your introductory prices.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:40.026 A:middle
First, there's a new property on

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:41.496 A:middle
SKProduct which is called

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:42.016 A:middle
fittingly enough

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:43.476 A:middle
introductoryPrice.

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:45.456 A:middle
This is a new class that's

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:46.676 A:middle
called SKProductDiscount.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:48.566 A:middle
This class contains all the

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:49.776 A:middle
information about introductory

00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:50.426 A:middle
price you've set up.

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.406 A:middle
And as you can see it's an

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:53.776 A:middle
optional property that's because

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.226 A:middle
only subscriptions can have

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:56.996 A:middle
introductory prices and not all

00:03:56.996 --> 00:03:59.226 A:middle
subscriptions will have them.

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:00.286 A:middle
So let's dive into
