00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:00.136 A:middle
episode.

00:29:01.076 --> 00:29:03.666 A:middle
And beneath the chart, if I

00:29:03.666 --> 00:29:05.006 A:middle
scroll down a little bit, we can

00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:08.416 A:middle
see for the last 60 days the

00:29:08.416 --> 00:29:10.506 A:middle
metrics for this show, for this

00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:11.676 A:middle
episode, I should say.

00:29:12.596 --> 00:29:14.586 A:middle
This gives you a more recent

00:29:14.896 --> 00:29:16.316 A:middle
sense of how this episode is

00:29:16.316 --> 00:29:17.706 A:middle
doing, not just all time.

00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:19.406 A:middle
And at the very bottom, we see

00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:20.836 A:middle
the top ten countries for this

00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:21.286 A:middle
episode.

00:29:22.236 --> 00:29:23.746 A:middle
But I'm going to scroll back up

00:29:23.746 --> 00:29:26.266 A:middle
and cover two things that I

00:29:26.476 --> 00:29:27.696 A:middle
breezed past before.

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:30.526 A:middle
There is a drop-down menu above

00:29:30.526 --> 00:29:32.376 A:middle
that all-time devices number,

00:29:33.116 --> 00:29:34.866 A:middle
and when I click on this, I can

00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:36.426 A:middle
see that I can also choose

00:29:36.576 --> 00:29:38.166 A:middle
Devices or Total Time Listened.

00:29:39.176 --> 00:29:40.246 A:middle
Now, by choosing either of

00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:41.736 A:middle
those, it will actually take us

00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.806 A:middle
into a view which is a time

00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:45.716 A:middle
series view, just like the Show

00:29:45.716 --> 00:29:47.636 A:middle
Trends page except this time

00:29:47.826 --> 00:29:49.016 A:middle
it's tied specifically to this

00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:49.436 A:middle
episode.

00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:55.896 A:middle
And now, the part of this graph

00:29:55.896 --> 00:29:57.866 A:middle
that I like the best is actually

00:29:57.866 --> 00:29:59.116 A:middle
the ability to play back the

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.236 A:middle
audio while seeing how the
