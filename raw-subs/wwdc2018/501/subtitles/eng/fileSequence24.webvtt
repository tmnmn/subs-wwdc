00:23:59.716 --> 00:24:00.976 A:middle
to compare against one another.

00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:03.046 A:middle
For example, we could choose

00:24:03.206 --> 00:24:04.496 A:middle
Country, and we'll have

00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:06.446 A:middle
countries in that table below.

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:08.566 A:middle
Whatever filters are not

00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:10.716 A:middle
selected from this menu, they

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:12.476 A:middle
move over to the right-hand side

00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:13.386 A:middle
of the page in their own

00:24:13.386 --> 00:24:14.076 A:middle
drop-downs.

00:24:15.256 --> 00:24:17.846 A:middle
For example, countries or

00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:19.246 A:middle
subscription state [phonetic].

00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:21.226 A:middle
For each of these, you can

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.446 A:middle
choose up to one filter.

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.926 A:middle
Now, with that, that's enough

00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:28.696 A:middle
talking through slides.

00:24:28.696 --> 00:24:30.416 A:middle
Let's look at a demo, and I will

00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:33.966 A:middle
take you back to that page but

00:24:34.596 --> 00:24:36.046 A:middle
in a hands-on fashion.

00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:38.926 A:middle
So, here we are.

00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:40.206 A:middle
We're in that same view that we

00:24:40.206 --> 00:24:42.146 A:middle
saw before of the Trends page.

00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:45.596 A:middle
But now, we can see what happens

00:24:45.596 --> 00:24:47.386 A:middle
when I interact with it.

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:49.086 A:middle
When I move my mouse cursor over

00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:51.526 A:middle
the chart, we have this nice

00:24:51.566 --> 00:24:53.526 A:middle
data legend with details about

00:24:53.526 --> 00:24:54.936 A:middle
the specific point that I'm

00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:55.546 A:middle
hovering over.

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:57.356 A:middle
In this case, I'm looking at May

00:24:57.356 --> 00:25:01.006 A:middle
18th, where 34,000 unique
