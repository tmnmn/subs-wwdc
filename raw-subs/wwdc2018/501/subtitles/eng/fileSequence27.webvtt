00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:00.446 A:middle
And now, because all episodes

00:27:00.446 --> 00:27:02.176 A:middle
are together in this view, we

00:27:02.176 --> 00:27:03.406 A:middle
have the opportunity now to

00:27:03.406 --> 00:27:04.706 A:middle
answer some other questions

00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:06.666 A:middle
like, what are the most popular

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:07.386 A:middle
episodes?

00:27:08.086 --> 00:27:09.396 A:middle
One way to answer that is by

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:12.016 A:middle
sorting by the Unique Devices

00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:12.426 A:middle
column.

00:27:13.326 --> 00:27:14.936 A:middle
When I do that, I can see that,

00:27:15.596 --> 00:27:17.076 A:middle
essentially, season 1, episode

00:27:17.076 --> 00:27:18.766 A:middle
4, Barcelona, Barbacoa, that is

00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:21.686 A:middle
the most popular by devices, by

00:27:21.686 --> 00:27:22.366 A:middle
unique devices.

00:27:22.706 --> 00:27:24.196 A:middle
But maybe you think that it's

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:25.426 A:middle
actually total time listened

00:27:26.056 --> 00:27:28.296 A:middle
that should be the determinant

00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:30.026 A:middle
of popularity, so I'm going to

00:27:30.476 --> 00:27:32.306 A:middle
sort by that instead, and we see

00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:33.416 A:middle
that it's actually season 2,

00:27:33.416 --> 00:27:35.856 A:middle
episode 1 that takes the top

00:27:36.226 --> 00:27:36.626 A:middle
spot.

00:27:36.626 --> 00:27:38.236 A:middle
Or for myself, I personally

00:27:38.236 --> 00:27:39.556 A:middle
really like average consumption,

00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:41.376 A:middle
so I'm going to sort by that,

00:27:41.376 --> 00:27:44.216 A:middle
and I can see that at 89%, the

00:27:44.216 --> 00:27:45.356 A:middle
trailer is actually the most

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.406 A:middle
popular episode, which makes

00:27:47.406 --> 00:27:48.476 A:middle
sense because it's a short

00:27:48.476 --> 00:27:48.976 A:middle
episode.

00:27:51.856 --> 00:27:53.606 A:middle
So, now, we've actually seen all

00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:55.266 A:middle
of the show level views.

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:56.846 A:middle
Now, I'd like to take you into

00:27:56.976 --> 00:27:58.706 A:middle
an episode level view.

00:27:58.796 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
So, I'm going to select, I'm
