those operating systems, Forward

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:02.656 A:middle
and the Analytic Dashboard

00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:04.296 A:middle
includes listening data from

00:13:04.296 --> 00:13:06.956 A:middle
HomePod, AppleTV, and will

00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:08.466 A:middle
include Apple Watch listening

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:11.326 A:middle
data starting in watchOS 5.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.476 A:middle
As you know, privacy is really

00:13:15.476 --> 00:13:17.346 A:middle
important to Apple, and we are

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:19.156 A:middle
only showing aggregate data of

00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:20.736 A:middle
those users who have agreed to

00:13:20.736 --> 00:13:22.996 A:middle
use the podcast app.

00:13:22.996 --> 00:13:25.356 A:middle
It is anonymous, not personally

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:28.246 A:middle
identifiable, not tied to your

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:29.896 A:middle
Apple ID, and we only reflect

00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:31.426 A:middle
the data points in aggregate

00:13:31.426 --> 00:13:32.456 A:middle
that we've collected from at

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:34.166 A:middle
least five unique devices.

00:13:34.816 --> 00:13:37.626 A:middle
And it couldn't be easier to get

00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:37.986 A:middle
started.

00:13:38.156 --> 00:13:39.466 A:middle
You don't need to write any

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.746 A:middle
code, you don't need to use an

00:13:40.746 --> 00:13:42.416 A:middle
SDK, and it's totally free.

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:44.636 A:middle
If you have a podcast, all you

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:46.796 A:middle
have to do is submit your feed

signed in, get it approved, get

00:13:51.046 --> 00:13:53.116 A:middle
