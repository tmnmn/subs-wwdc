first episode of this season,

00:22:00.876 --> 00:22:01.636 A:middle
they actually went down to

00:22:01.636 --> 00:22:02.226 A:middle
Brazil.

00:22:02.766 --> 00:22:03.946 A:middle
They did some marketing and

00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:07.296 A:middle
promotion, and it's starting to

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.156 A:middle
pay off.

00:22:09.156 --> 00:22:10.526 A:middle
So, next, let's scroll down to

00:22:10.526 --> 00:22:13.076 A:middle
the bottom of the page, and here

00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:14.886 A:middle
we can see the ten most recently

00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:16.686 A:middle
released episodes for the show.

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:19.266 A:middle
This is the same sort of data

00:22:19.266 --> 00:22:20.466 A:middle
table that we saw before for

00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:22.246 A:middle
episodes, but this time it's for

00:22:22.396 --> 00:22:23.126 A:middle
a single show.

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.946 A:middle
What's nice about this is we can

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:26.806 A:middle
compare apples to apples and

00:22:26.806 --> 00:22:28.816 A:middle
really see on an episode by

00:22:28.816 --> 00:22:30.886 A:middle
episode basis how things are

00:22:30.886 --> 00:22:32.896 A:middle
turning out.

00:22:33.176 --> 00:22:34.926 A:middle
Let's go back up to the top, and

00:22:36.016 --> 00:22:37.476 A:middle
we're going to switch from the

00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:40.356 A:middle
Show Overview to add to the

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:41.176 A:middle
Trends tab.

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:43.916 A:middle
So, here we are in the Trends

00:22:43.916 --> 00:22:44.166 A:middle
tab.

00:22:45.516 --> 00:22:47.456 A:middle
This is a Time Series Chart

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
where we can see day by day how

00:22:49.996 --> 00:22:51.296 A:middle
many people are tuning into this

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:51.706 A:middle
show.

00:22:51.846 --> 00:22:53.916 A:middle
And again, by default, we're

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:55.726 A:middle
looking at the last 60 days of

00:22:55.726 --> 00:22:56.046 A:middle
data.

00:22:56.816 --> 00:22:58.846 A:middle
In the top left corner, we see

00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
