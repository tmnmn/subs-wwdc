00:27:58.796 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
So, I'm going to select, I'm

00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:01.916 A:middle
going to click through on the

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:03.246 A:middle
title for the most recently

00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:04.196 A:middle
released episode.

00:28:05.196 --> 00:28:06.506 A:middle
Here's Broken Heirloom.

00:28:06.806 --> 00:28:08.966 A:middle
So, it was just released on June

00:28:08.966 --> 00:28:09.686 A:middle
1st.

00:28:10.686 --> 00:28:11.656 A:middle
Front and center, we see a

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:12.666 A:middle
timeline chart.

00:28:13.186 --> 00:28:14.876 A:middle
This shows you the audience size

00:28:15.526 --> 00:28:16.806 A:middle
over the duration of the

00:28:16.806 --> 00:28:18.496 A:middle
episode; actually, at every five

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.686 A:middle
seconds, and when I hover over

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:22.176 A:middle
the chart, I can see a data

00:28:22.176 --> 00:28:23.986 A:middle
legend again with details about

00:28:23.986 --> 00:28:25.226 A:middle
the specific time in the

00:28:25.226 --> 00:28:26.816 A:middle
episode, its total count, and

00:28:26.816 --> 00:28:27.866 A:middle
its percentage of the max.

00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:32.086 A:middle
And in the top left corner, we

00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:34.316 A:middle
see this headline number for the

00:28:34.316 --> 00:28:35.726 A:middle
total number of unique devices.

00:28:36.686 --> 00:28:37.866 A:middle
Something to note about this

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.076 A:middle
chart, unlike all the other

00:28:39.076 --> 00:28:41.126 A:middle
views on this, in Podcast

00:28:41.126 --> 00:28:42.836 A:middle
Analytics, this chart is

00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:45.266 A:middle
actually for all time, not just

00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.436 A:middle
a specified date range.

00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:51.416 A:middle
Now, what's really nice to see

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:54.096 A:middle
here is that, in this case, most

00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:55.166 A:middle
of the people who started this

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.726 A:middle
episode actually hung out for

00:28:56.726 --> 00:28:57.896 A:middle
the entire duration.

00:28:58.426 --> 00:28:59.656 A:middle
This is a really healthy-looking

00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:00.136 A:middle
episode.
