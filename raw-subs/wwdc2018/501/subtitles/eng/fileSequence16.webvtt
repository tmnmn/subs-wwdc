Now, if you have any trouble,

00:16:02.746 --> 00:16:05.486 A:middle
such as you forget your password

00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.966 A:middle
for your Apple ID, or you don't

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.216 A:middle
know which Apple ID to use, or

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:11.656 A:middle
if after you've logged in you

00:16:11.656 --> 00:16:12.826 A:middle
don't see all the shows you

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:15.716 A:middle
expect to see, go to the top

00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:17.086 A:middle
right corner of this page and

00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:18.196 A:middle
click on that question mark

00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:18.616 A:middle
icon.

00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:20.546 A:middle
That will take you to Resources

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.256 A:middle
and Help, and there you can find

00:16:22.256 --> 00:16:23.926 A:middle
Contact this Link, where people

00:16:23.926 --> 00:16:25.046 A:middle
can give you the assistance you

00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:25.256 A:middle
need.

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:27.896 A:middle
In this example, we're going to

00:16:27.896 --> 00:16:29.846 A:middle
use John Appleseed's login

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:30.486 A:middle
credentials.

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:32.776 A:middle
So, let's login now and see what

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:35.086 A:middle
he sees when he enters Podcast

00:16:35.086 --> 00:16:35.506 A:middle
Analytics.

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:43.486 A:middle
So, this is the show's page.

00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:45.466 A:middle
Here, we see five shows for

00:16:45.466 --> 00:16:46.146 A:middle
John's account.

00:16:47.286 --> 00:16:50.796 A:middle
In this table, there are three

00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:52.316 A:middle
metrics, and we're going to take

00:16:52.316 --> 00:16:54.356 A:middle
a look at those in a minute, and

00:16:54.356 --> 00:16:56.426 A:middle
all of the data in this table is

00:16:56.426 --> 00:16:58.016 A:middle
driven by the date picker, which

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.106 A:middle
is in the top right corner.

00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
