00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.236 A:middle
audio while seeing how the

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:02.916 A:middle
audience is reacting over the

00:30:02.916 --> 00:30:03.966 A:middle
duration of the episode.

00:30:03.966 --> 00:30:06.696 A:middle
And I can do this by going down

00:30:06.696 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
to the bottom left corner of the

00:30:07.696 --> 00:30:09.266 A:middle
graph and hitting this Play

00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:09.636 A:middle
button.

00:30:10.236 --> 00:30:12.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey there, Hunger Heads, and

00:30:12.206 --> 00:30:13.606 A:middle
welcome back to another episode

00:30:13.606 --> 00:30:15.286 A:middle
of The Very Hungry Tourists.

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:16.906 A:middle
I'm Maria Sanchez, Ph.D.

00:30:16.906 --> 00:30:18.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm Johnny Appleseed.

00:30:18.486 --> 00:30:19.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; In today's episode, we're

00:30:19.856 --> 00:30:21.466 A:middle
headed to Brooklyn based Viny's

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:21.926 A:middle
Pizzeria.

00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:23.876 A:middle
As we're here, even Johnny's

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:25.786 A:middle
massive wonder couldn't get in

00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:26.906 A:middle
the way of our culinary

00:30:26.906 --> 00:30:27.286 A:middle
adventure.

00:30:27.466 --> 00:30:28.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm still blushing from that

00:30:28.456 --> 00:30:28.646 A:middle
one.

00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:30.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, this is actually a very

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.546 A:middle
entertaining episode, so if you

00:30:32.546 --> 00:30:33.276 A:middle
get a chance, you should

00:30:33.276 --> 00:30:34.166 A:middle
definitely check it out.

00:30:35.836 --> 00:30:38.956 A:middle
But like any basic player, you

00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:39.976 A:middle
don't just have to start at the

00:30:39.976 --> 00:30:40.396 A:middle
beginning.

00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:41.296 A:middle
You can also click on the

00:30:41.296 --> 00:30:42.946 A:middle
timeline to jump ahead to any

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:45.486 A:middle
specific spot in time, and if

00:30:45.486 --> 00:30:47.066 A:middle
you want to fine tune, you can

00:30:47.066 --> 00:30:48.726 A:middle
grab the play head and scrub

00:30:48.726 --> 00:30:48.856 A:middle
around.

00:30:48.856 --> 00:30:50.986 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to scrub

00:30:50.986 --> 00:30:52.366 A:middle
to the beginning of what looks

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:53.076 A:middle
like an ad.

00:30:53.866 --> 00:30:55.566 A:middle
And so, just to validate my

00:30:55.566 --> 00:30:56.876 A:middle
assumptions, I'm going to move

00:30:56.876 --> 00:30:58.586 A:middle
to just before and take a

00:30:58.586 --> 00:30:59.056 A:middle
listen.

00:30:59.426 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Five years, you wouldn't
