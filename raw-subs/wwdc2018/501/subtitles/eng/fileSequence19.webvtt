00:18:58.266 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
So, we have devices, total time

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:01.556 A:middle
listened, and time per device.

00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:04.916 A:middle
And for the first time, we see

00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:06.006 A:middle
average consumption.

00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:07.626 A:middle
This is the last metric in the

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:08.576 A:middle
far right column.

00:19:09.326 --> 00:19:11.326 A:middle
Average consumption is really

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:12.686 A:middle
great because it's really just

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:14.056 A:middle
another way of looking at time

00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:14.826 A:middle
per device.

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:17.586 A:middle
So, in this case, it's 28 minute

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:19.846 A:middle
for this 35-minute long episode.

00:19:20.606 --> 00:19:21.856 A:middle
That is 81%.

00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:23.286 A:middle
What's nice about average

00:19:23.286 --> 00:19:24.996 A:middle
consumption is it allows us to

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.786 A:middle
compare episodes of differing

00:19:26.786 --> 00:19:29.096 A:middle
durations against each other to

00:19:29.096 --> 00:19:30.446 A:middle
really get a sense of how

00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:31.906 A:middle
healthy each episode is doing.

00:19:34.446 --> 00:19:37.036 A:middle
And from here, let's click

00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
through on the Show Title and

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:40.186 A:middle
look at the show overview for

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:41.496 A:middle
The Very Hungry Tourists.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.836 A:middle
So, here's the show overview.

00:19:46.456 --> 00:19:48.426 A:middle
There's a lot going on here.

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:49.526 A:middle
Let's start at the top.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.636 A:middle
Across the top, we have three

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:53.606 A:middle
headline numbers.

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:54.756 A:middle
These are the same numbers that

00:19:54.756 --> 00:19:56.236 A:middle
we saw before in the shows

00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:58.606 A:middle
table, but now we have a mini

00:19:58.606 --> 00:20:00.086 A:middle
time series underneath these
