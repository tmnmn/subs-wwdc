00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.496 A:middle
This is the audio instalment of

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:04.396 A:middle
the Queen of Talks iconic

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:06.776 A:middle
interview franchise, and we were

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:08.256 A:middle
overjoyed to have Oprah on Apple

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:08.946 A:middle
Podcast.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.666 A:middle
These examples are just three of

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:16.096 A:middle
the more than 550,000 shows

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:17.406 A:middle
available today on Apple

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.026 A:middle
Podcast.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.246 A:middle
That's quite a bit more content

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:21.476 A:middle
to listen to than the original

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:23.416 A:middle
3,000 programs we launched with

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:26.966 A:middle
back in 2005.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.456 A:middle
We're continually refreshing and

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:29.836 A:middle
managing our directory,

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.846 A:middle
automatically retiring shows

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:32.966 A:middle
which become technically

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:34.666 A:middle
unavailable or those that run

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:36.696 A:middle
afoul of our directory content

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.766 A:middle
guidelines, such as those with

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.026 A:middle
spammy content or shows seeking

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.786 A:middle
to manipulate our top charts.

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:43.916 A:middle
Don't do that.

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:44.976 A:middle
Just please don't do that.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:46.856 A:middle
At the same time as we're

00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:48.506 A:middle
managing the directory, we're

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:50.006 A:middle
accepting thousands of new

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:51.196 A:middle
submissions per week.

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.286 A:middle
That way, our catalogue is

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.236 A:middle
continually refreshed, and our

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:56.546 A:middle
users around the world can

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:57.976 A:middle
always find something great to

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.046 A:middle
listen to.
