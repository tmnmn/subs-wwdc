00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.936 A:middle
podcast sounds the best it can

00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:04.466 A:middle
on HomePod and within the

00:34:04.466 --> 00:34:06.006 A:middle
context of the Apple Podcast

00:34:06.006 --> 00:34:06.536 A:middle
catalogue.

00:34:07.116 --> 00:34:08.306 A:middle
We'll be sharing these

00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:09.716 A:middle
requirements with you all.

00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:11.146 A:middle
We will put them in Podcast

00:34:11.146 --> 00:34:12.846 A:middle
Resources at Help so you can

00:34:12.846 --> 00:34:14.726 A:middle
refer back to them anytime.

00:34:15.926 --> 00:34:18.156 A:middle
And speaking of which, last but

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.525 A:middle
not least, I want to remind you

00:34:19.525 --> 00:34:20.656 A:middle
about our resources for

00:34:20.656 --> 00:34:21.416 A:middle
podcasters.

00:34:22.585 --> 00:34:25.536 A:middle
So, we have a Branding Guide for

00:34:25.536 --> 00:34:26.466 A:middle
podcasters.

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:28.906 A:middle
We also have the Affiliate

00:34:28.906 --> 00:34:31.045 A:middle
Program, and then Podcast

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:32.466 A:middle
Resources and Help, which you

00:34:32.466 --> 00:34:33.616 A:middle
might remember from the top

00:34:33.616 --> 00:34:34.755 A:middle
right corner of the purple

00:34:34.755 --> 00:34:36.396 A:middle
screen that Alec showed you.

00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:38.565 A:middle
That features the hosting

00:34:38.565 --> 00:34:39.835 A:middle
partner list that James

00:34:39.835 --> 00:34:42.226 A:middle
mentioned; some tutorial videos

00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:44.096 A:middle
for analytics, and of course,

00:34:44.096 --> 00:34:46.216 A:middle
the ability to contact us for

00:34:46.216 --> 00:34:47.326 A:middle
help anytime.
