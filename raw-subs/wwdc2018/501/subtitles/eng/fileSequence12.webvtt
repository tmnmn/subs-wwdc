00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
it's as simple as toggling the

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.426 A:middle
switches on this single settings

00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:02.826 A:middle
page.

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:07.676 A:middle
So, last year, at WWDC, we

00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:09.196 A:middle
announced that Apple would be

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:10.946 A:middle
launching Podcast Analytics for

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:11.696 A:middle
the first time.

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:13.856 A:middle
We were super excited to launch

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:16.506 A:middle
at the end of 2017, and Podcast

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:18.426 A:middle
Analytics is available in beta

00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:20.846 A:middle
right now today to anyone with a

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.226 A:middle
podcast in our catalogue.

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:26.136 A:middle
We know that this is a service

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:28.376 A:middle
that was long desired and speaks

00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:29.626 A:middle
to a critical need in the

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:32.156 A:middle
industry as evidence by work

00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:33.756 A:middle
like the remote audio data spec

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.586 A:middle
being spearheaded by NPR.

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.556 A:middle
So, it's important to us that we

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.326 A:middle
provide this anonymous data back

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:42.076 A:middle
to publishers to help them

00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:44.266 A:middle
better understand how their

00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:45.946 A:middle
audiences are consuming their

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:46.276 A:middle
audio.

00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:49.156 A:middle
And all of the data and

00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:51.576 A:middle
analytics is based on the use of

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.496 A:middle
the update Apple podcasts app

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:57.076 A:middle
from iOS 11 and iTunes 12.7.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.206 A:middle
We're collecting data only from

00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:00.736 A:middle
those operating systems, Forward
