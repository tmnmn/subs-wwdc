00:18:00.156 --> 00:18:01.556 A:middle
Here, we see a few of the most

00:18:01.556 --> 00:18:03.006 A:middle
recently released episodes.

00:18:05.846 --> 00:18:07.096 A:middle
Now, this data table has a lot

00:18:07.096 --> 00:18:08.436 A:middle
more information in it, and

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:10.196 A:middle
let's take a look at the top

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:10.606 A:middle
row.

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:13.906 A:middle
This is the most recent episode

00:18:13.906 --> 00:18:15.136 A:middle
from The Very Hungry Tourists,

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.056 A:middle
starting on the right-hand side,

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.946 A:middle
we can see the name of the

00:18:19.946 --> 00:18:21.426 A:middle
episode, then the name of the

00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:24.026 A:middle
show, and now, the third column

00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:25.046 A:middle
is the episode column.

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:26.686 A:middle
If you're making use of the new

00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:28.746 A:middle
tags, like season, episode, and

00:18:28.746 --> 00:18:30.586 A:middle
episode type, they'll show up

00:18:30.586 --> 00:18:30.876 A:middle
here.

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:33.246 A:middle
Following that, we have the

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.646 A:middle
release date and then the

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:35.326 A:middle
duration.

00:18:36.056 --> 00:18:37.016 A:middle
So, in this case, it's a

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:38.466 A:middle
35-minute long episode.

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:41.036 A:middle
If, when you login, you don't

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:42.146 A:middle
see the right number in the

00:18:42.146 --> 00:18:45.086 A:middle
duration column, it's because of

00:18:45.086 --> 00:18:46.136 A:middle
what you have in your feed.

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:47.626 A:middle
We pulled this number straight

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.226 A:middle
from your feed.

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:49.866 A:middle
So, make sure it's accurate.

00:18:51.136 --> 00:18:53.026 A:middle
Following the duration column,

00:18:53.026 --> 00:18:54.286 A:middle
we see three columns that we've

00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:56.116 A:middle
seen before, except this time,

00:18:56.556 --> 00:18:57.976 A:middle
for this episode specifically.

00:18:58.266 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
So, we have devices, total time
