00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
that headline number again of

00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:04.046 A:middle
256,000 unique devices, and down

00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:05.706 A:middle
below the Time Series Chart we

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:08.506 A:middle
see a table with episode titles.

00:23:08.626 --> 00:23:10.046 A:middle
We can choose up to five

00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:11.636 A:middle
separate episodes to compare

00:23:11.636 --> 00:23:12.996 A:middle
against one another in the chart

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:13.316 A:middle
above.

00:23:16.136 --> 00:23:18.676 A:middle
So, let's first now talk about

00:23:18.806 --> 00:23:21.146 A:middle
all of the different drop downs

00:23:21.416 --> 00:23:23.836 A:middle
that control the chart and what

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:24.656 A:middle
we see in it.

00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:27.286 A:middle
First up, we have a drop-down.

00:23:27.286 --> 00:23:28.866 A:middle
This is the metric that we're

00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:29.566 A:middle
going to chart.

00:23:29.906 --> 00:23:31.086 A:middle
By default, we start off with

00:23:31.086 --> 00:23:33.146 A:middle
Unique Devices, or you can also

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:35.236 A:middle
choose to have it render Total

00:23:35.236 --> 00:23:35.826 A:middle
Time Listened.

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:39.396 A:middle
To the right of that, we have

00:23:39.396 --> 00:23:40.486 A:middle
another drop-down.

00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:41.876 A:middle
This is what I call the primary

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:42.306 A:middle
filter.

00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:44.716 A:middle
By default here, we're looking

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:46.886 A:middle
at Episode as the primary

00:23:46.886 --> 00:23:48.286 A:middle
filter, but you might want to

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:50.116 A:middle
choose Country or Subscribed

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:50.546 A:middle
Device.

00:23:50.906 --> 00:23:52.236 A:middle
Now, whatever you choose for

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:53.566 A:middle
your primary filter, that's

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:54.826 A:middle
going to dictate the table

00:23:54.826 --> 00:23:55.636 A:middle
beneath the chart.

00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:57.926 A:middle
So, whatever is selected allows

00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:59.716 A:middle
you to choose multiple entries

00:23:59.716 --> 00:24:00.976 A:middle
to compare against one another.
