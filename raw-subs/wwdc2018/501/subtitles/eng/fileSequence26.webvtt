00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:00.476 A:middle
makes it difficult to see the

00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:01.396 A:middle
other countries and how they

00:26:01.396 --> 00:26:02.486 A:middle
stack up against each other.

00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:04.276 A:middle
So, I'm actually going to go and

00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:05.786 A:middle
deselect the United States.

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:08.796 A:middle
The chart adjusts, and we can

00:26:08.976 --> 00:26:11.576 A:middle
really see with more detail how

00:26:11.576 --> 00:26:14.816 A:middle
each country is doing.

00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:17.716 A:middle
And now that I can, I'm going to

00:26:17.716 --> 00:26:20.176 A:middle
show you the date picker.

00:26:20.326 --> 00:26:21.316 A:middle
It's up here on the top right

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:21.706 A:middle
corner.

00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:23.336 A:middle
By default, it sets at the last

00:26:23.336 --> 00:26:24.086 A:middle
60 days.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.696 A:middle
You can switch that to weeks or

00:26:26.926 --> 00:26:29.226 A:middle
a specific month, but we'll

00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:30.016 A:middle
leave it at that for now.

00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:31.926 A:middle
Now, there are lots of

00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:33.476 A:middle
combinations that you can make

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:36.206 A:middle
here, but I'm going to move on

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:38.076 A:middle
after this, but I really

00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:39.306 A:middle
encourage you to take a look at

00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:40.506 A:middle
your shows and see how they're

00:26:40.506 --> 00:26:42.316 A:middle
doing and really play around

00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:42.786 A:middle
with this tool.

00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:44.066 A:middle
I think it's a lot of fun to

00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:44.456 A:middle
use.

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.106 A:middle
So, let's switch over to the

00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:48.666 A:middle
Show Episodes tab, and in this

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:49.966 A:middle
view, we can see the top

00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:52.286 A:middle
episodes or all episodes for the

00:26:52.286 --> 00:26:54.066 A:middle
show, not just the top episodes.

00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:56.586 A:middle
In this case, the show has 11,

00:26:57.026 --> 00:26:58.076 A:middle
11 episodes total.

00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:00.446 A:middle
And now, because all episodes
