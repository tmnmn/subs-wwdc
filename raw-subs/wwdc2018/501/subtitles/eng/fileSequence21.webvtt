00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:01.946 A:middle
but your subscribed count might

00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:04.236 A:middle
be above 90, even 95%.

00:21:05.276 --> 00:21:07.466 A:middle
Conversely, if you're doing a

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.956 A:middle
lot of marketing or promotion,

00:21:09.306 --> 00:21:11.966 A:middle
or your show is growing rapidly,

00:21:13.146 --> 00:21:14.376 A:middle
you're not subscribed count

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:16.506 A:middle
might be fairly high.

00:21:18.266 --> 00:21:19.656 A:middle
Now, when somebody first starts

00:21:19.656 --> 00:21:20.786 A:middle
to listen to your show,

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.006 A:middle
obviously, they're not going to

00:21:22.006 --> 00:21:23.576 A:middle
be subscribed most of the time.

00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:25.336 A:middle
But once they hear what you have

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:26.796 A:middle
and they hit that "Subscribe"

00:21:26.796 --> 00:21:29.096 A:middle
button, that's when they end up

00:21:29.096 --> 00:21:32.976 A:middle
in the other bucket.

00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:33.716 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:34.846 A:middle
chart to the right.

00:21:34.846 --> 00:21:36.066 A:middle
This is the Top Countries by

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:36.556 A:middle
Device.

00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:37.876 A:middle
Here, we can see the top five

00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
countries for the show.

00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.066 A:middle
As we can see, the United States

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.566 A:middle
comprises the majority of the

00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:44.426 A:middle
listening at 78%.

00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:47.936 A:middle
If we look at the fifth spot, we

00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:48.716 A:middle
see Brazil.

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:50.726 A:middle
Now, what's neat about this is

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.176 A:middle
that Brazil wasn't on this top

00:21:52.176 --> 00:21:55.246 A:middle
five before, but as Anne said

00:21:55.246 --> 00:21:57.636 A:middle
earlier, this is season 2 of The

00:21:57.636 --> 00:21:59.156 A:middle
Very Hungry Tourists, and on the

00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:00.676 A:middle
first episode of this season,
