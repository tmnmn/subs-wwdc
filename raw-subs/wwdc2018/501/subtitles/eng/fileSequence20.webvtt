00:19:58.606 --> 00:20:00.086 A:middle
time series underneath these

00:20:00.086 --> 00:20:02.596 A:middle
numbers to give you a sense of

00:20:02.596 --> 00:20:03.616 A:middle
how things are doing.

00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:06.776 A:middle
Maybe you can see, just looking

00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:08.676 A:middle
at that little line, if your

00:20:08.676 --> 00:20:11.756 A:middle
show is getting more or fewer

00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:13.206 A:middle
listeners over time.

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:16.776 A:middle
Now, let's look beneath this row

00:20:17.796 --> 00:20:19.746 A:middle
and take a look at the chart on

00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:20.516 A:middle
the left here.

00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:22.606 A:middle
This is the donut chart of total

00:20:22.606 --> 00:20:23.216 A:middle
time listened.

00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:27.836 A:middle
So, for all of the time spent

00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:29.866 A:middle
listening to your show, were

00:20:30.716 --> 00:20:32.966 A:middle
those devices subscribed or not

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:33.526 A:middle
subscribed?

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:36.446 A:middle
Here, we can see that 83% of

00:20:36.446 --> 00:20:38.706 A:middle
that 328,000 total hours of

00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:39.896 A:middle
listening was done by a

00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:42.776 A:middle
subscribed device versus 17% not

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:43.246 A:middle
subscribed.

00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:45.166 A:middle
So, these are pretty good

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:45.636 A:middle
numbers.

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.036 A:middle
But why might these numbers be

00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:49.046 A:middle
different when you take a look

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:49.996 A:middle
at your data?

00:20:50.826 --> 00:20:53.396 A:middle
Well, if you have a very small

00:20:53.396 --> 00:20:55.076 A:middle
podcast, one with a very

00:20:55.206 --> 00:20:57.516 A:middle
dedicated following, you might

00:20:57.516 --> 00:20:59.676 A:middle
not have too many new listeners,
