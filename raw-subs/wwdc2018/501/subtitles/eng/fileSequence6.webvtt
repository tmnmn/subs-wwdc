00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.546 A:middle
developing iOS 11 apps with SWF

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:04.376 A:middle
from Stanford's Paul Haggerty.

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
Naturally, we're eager for the

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.006 A:middle
new instalment of this class

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:10.186 A:middle
series later this year.

00:06:10.856 --> 00:06:12.446 A:middle
As part of Apple Podcast,

00:06:12.686 --> 00:06:14.836 A:middle
teachers can now leverage the

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:17.016 A:middle
episode serial ordering support

00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:17.966 A:middle
in Podcast app.

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.306 A:middle
They can reach a new broader

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:22.526 A:middle
audience of lifelong learners

00:06:22.526 --> 00:06:24.616 A:middle
around the world, and it can

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:27.266 A:middle
distribute the content on tvOS

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.306 A:middle
for the first time.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:32.296 A:middle
We're seeing some great use of

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:34.256 A:middle
modern podcast tags, which we

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.576 A:middle
introduced last year right here

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:38.336 A:middle
on stage at WWDC.

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:41.306 A:middle
Many podcasts include trailers

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:42.586 A:middle
to thematically introduce the

00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:44.346 A:middle
feel and sound of their show.

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:46.286 A:middle
This is the best way really to

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:48.636 A:middle
launch a new podcast, and ESPN,

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:50.136 A:middle
for example, makes great use of

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:52.006 A:middle
trailers and, in addition, is

00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:53.636 A:middle
amongst the chart shopping shows

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:56.036 A:middle
that uses seasons and bonus

00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:56.576 A:middle
content.

00:06:57.246 --> 00:06:58.646 A:middle
This allows Jody Avragon

00:06:58.646 --> 00:06:59.416 A:middle
[phonetic] and the team to

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
easily present the thematically
