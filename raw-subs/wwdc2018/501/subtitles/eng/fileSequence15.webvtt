[ Audience Applause ]

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:04.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Anne.

00:15:05.806 --> 00:15:08.216 A:middle
So, podcasters, every day you're

00:15:08.216 --> 00:15:10.846 A:middle
hard at work making great shows

00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:12.416 A:middle
and episodes for people to enjoy

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:13.256 A:middle
all over the world.

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:15.326 A:middle
But how much do you know about

00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:16.026 A:middle
your audience?

00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:19.276 A:middle
Do you know how many listeners

00:15:19.276 --> 00:15:20.986 A:middle
you have or how much they

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:21.386 A:middle
listen?

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:23.356 A:middle
Do you know where they are

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:24.236 A:middle
around the world?

00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:25.956 A:middle
What are their favorite

00:15:25.956 --> 00:15:26.516 A:middle
episodes?

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:28.966 A:middle
With Podcast Analytics, Apple

00:15:28.966 --> 00:15:31.146 A:middle
offers you transparency into how

00:15:31.146 --> 00:15:33.296 A:middle
your show is heard, so you can

00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:34.666 A:middle
better understand your listeners

00:15:35.116 --> 00:15:36.106 A:middle
and create the best show for

00:15:36.106 --> 00:15:36.766 A:middle
your audience.

00:15:37.886 --> 00:15:39.076 A:middle
My name is Alec Reitter, and I'm

00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:40.596 A:middle
going to do a walkthrough and

00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:42.306 A:middle
demo of Podcast Analytics.

00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:44.616 A:middle
So, let's get started by heading

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:45.606 A:middle
to the login page.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:48.946 A:middle
When you see this bright purple

00:15:48.946 --> 00:15:50.316 A:middle
page, you know you've made it to

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.056 A:middle
the right place.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.156 A:middle
Here, we're going to login with

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:55.006 A:middle
the Apple ID that we used to

00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:56.926 A:middle
originally submit the podcast

00:15:56.926 --> 00:15:59.056 A:middle
feed to the Apple Podcast

00:15:59.056 --> 00:15:59.496 A:middle
catalogue.
