00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
We're also really excited to

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.996 A:middle
share that we've enhanced our

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.366 A:middle
support for chapters in the

00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:05.956 A:middle
podcast app.

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:07.556 A:middle
In the upcoming IRS release,

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:09.116 A:middle
we're extending full chapter

00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:10.806 A:middle
support to MP3s.

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:13.486 A:middle
In addition to enabling

00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:15.046 A:middle
podcasters to segment their

00:11:15.106 --> 00:11:17.266 A:middle
episodes into shorter discrete

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:19.086 A:middle
chapters, this functionality

00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:21.316 A:middle
also includes chapter art that

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:22.816 A:middle
displays as the play head

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.426 A:middle
advances across chapters.

00:11:24.636 --> 00:11:26.596 A:middle
So, podcasters can supplement

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.496 A:middle
their audio with visual content.

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:32.786 A:middle
In the upcoming iOS release,

00:11:32.786 --> 00:11:34.856 A:middle
we're also offering an improved

00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:35.986 A:middle
experience for podcast

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:36.856 A:middle
notifications.

00:11:37.556 --> 00:11:38.996 A:middle
The new podcast notifications

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:40.696 A:middle
are grouped across shows and

00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:42.406 A:middle
episodes into a single

00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:45.266 A:middle
expandable stack that reduces

00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:48.596 A:middle
clutter on screen, and we also

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:50.876 A:middle
provide one-tap access to

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.596 A:middle
notification settings for all of

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:53.236 A:middle
your shows.

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.116 A:middle
That means if you only want to

00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:56.536 A:middle
get notifications for your

00:11:56.536 --> 00:11:58.576 A:middle
favorite show, 99% invisible,
