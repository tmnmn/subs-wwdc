00:29:01.046 --> 00:29:01.806 A:middle
So this is a function.

00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:03.976 A:middle
There are a few lines of code,

00:29:03.976 --> 00:29:05.866 A:middle
but all that it's doing is three

00:29:05.866 --> 00:29:06.276 A:middle
things.

00:29:07.226 --> 00:29:10.966 A:middle
First, it's giving a name of a

00:29:11.026 --> 00:29:11.306 A:middle
class.

00:29:11.806 --> 00:29:13.566 A:middle
So as we might have noticed, the

00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:15.126 A:middle
implementation of the layer is

00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:15.546 A:middle
not here.

00:29:15.906 --> 00:29:17.096 A:middle
The implementation will come

00:29:17.096 --> 00:29:19.506 A:middle
later in the app and it will be

00:29:19.506 --> 00:29:20.866 A:middle
encapsulated in a class.

00:29:21.286 --> 00:29:22.136 A:middle
And this is the name of the

00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:23.836 A:middle
class that we'll later

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:24.286 A:middle
implement.

00:29:24.666 --> 00:29:26.436 A:middle
So during conversion, we just

00:29:26.436 --> 00:29:27.756 A:middle
need to specify this class name.

00:29:28.156 --> 00:29:28.456 A:middle
That's it.

00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:30.436 A:middle
And then there's the description

00:29:30.816 --> 00:29:32.206 A:middle
which is a, which you should

00:29:32.206 --> 00:29:34.536 A:middle
provide so that if anybody is,

00:29:34.746 --> 00:29:37.086 A:middle
if somebody is looking at your

00:29:37.086 --> 00:29:38.266 A:middle
model, they know what it has.

00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:40.926 A:middle
And the third thing is basically

00:29:40.996 --> 00:29:42.766 A:middle
translating any parameters that

00:29:42.766 --> 00:29:44.466 A:middle
the Keras layer had to Core ML.

00:29:45.046 --> 00:29:46.206 A:middle
For this particular layer, it

00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:47.146 A:middle
has two parameters.

00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:48.756 A:middle
The output height, and output

00:29:48.816 --> 00:29:48.946 A:middle
weight.

00:29:49.336 --> 00:29:50.716 A:middle
And I'm just translating it to

00:29:50.716 --> 00:29:51.066 A:middle
Core ML.

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:52.956 A:middle
If your custom layer that does

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:54.356 A:middle
not have any parameters, then

00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:56.626 A:middle
you load, then you do not need

00:29:56.626 --> 00:29:57.616 A:middle
to do, do this.

00:29:58.356 --> 00:29:59.516 A:middle
If your layer has lots of

00:29:59.516 --> 00:30:01.116 A:middle
parameters, they can all go
