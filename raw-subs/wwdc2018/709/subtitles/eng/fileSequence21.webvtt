00:20:59.706 --> 00:21:00.546 A:middle
learning research that's

00:21:00.646 --> 00:21:02.616 A:middle
happening around us.

00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:04.746 A:middle
As you all know, the field of

00:21:04.746 --> 00:21:06.336 A:middle
machine learning is expanding

00:21:06.336 --> 00:21:07.146 A:middle
very rapidly.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.576 A:middle
So it's very critical for us at

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:11.836 A:middle
Core ML to provide you with the

00:21:11.836 --> 00:21:14.046 A:middle
necessary software tools to help

00:21:14.046 --> 00:21:15.616 A:middle
with that.

00:21:15.886 --> 00:21:16.866 A:middle
Now let's take an example.

00:21:17.836 --> 00:21:19.986 A:middle
Let's say you are experimenting

00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:21.036 A:middle
with a new model that that is

00:21:21.036 --> 00:21:22.096 A:middle
not supported on Core ML.

00:21:22.426 --> 00:21:24.536 A:middle
Or let's say you have a neural

00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:27.636 A:middle
network that runs on Core ML but

00:21:27.636 --> 00:21:29.056 A:middle
maybe there's a layer or two

00:21:29.436 --> 00:21:31.606 A:middle
that Core ML does not have yet.

00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.606 A:middle
In that case, you should still

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:37.466 A:middle
be able to use the power of Core

00:21:37.466 --> 00:21:38.446 A:middle
ML, right?

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:40.386 A:middle
And the answer to that question

00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:40.766 A:middle
is yes.

00:21:41.666 --> 00:21:43.726 A:middle
And the feature of customization

00:21:43.986 --> 00:21:44.786 A:middle
will help you there.

00:21:45.756 --> 00:21:47.906 A:middle
In the next few minutes, I want

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:50.346 A:middle
to really focus on the specific

00:21:50.346 --> 00:21:52.866 A:middle
use case of having a new neural

00:21:52.866 --> 00:21:53.506 A:middle
network layer.

00:21:53.916 --> 00:21:55.546 A:middle
And show you how you would

00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:57.496 A:middle
convert it to Core ML and then

00:21:57.666 --> 00:21:58.796 A:middle
how you would implement it in

00:21:58.826 --> 00:22:00.596 A:middle
your app.
