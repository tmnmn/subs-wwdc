00:25:00.076 --> 00:25:01.566 A:middle
I hope it works on the first

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:01.826 A:middle
try.

00:25:03.236 --> 00:25:04.836 A:middle
Back, oh yes.

00:25:05.996 --> 00:25:09.476 A:middle
Okay. So let me close off these

00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:09.966 A:middle
windows.

00:25:14.636 --> 00:25:16.766 A:middle
Let me get, clear this.

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:17.596 A:middle
Clear the ML.

00:25:18.106 --> 00:25:20.246 A:middle
Okay, so I'm also going to use

00:25:20.446 --> 00:25:22.526 A:middle
Jupyter Notebook to show the

00:25:22.526 --> 00:25:22.846 A:middle
demo.

00:25:30.046 --> 00:25:31.696 A:middle
So I just navigate to the folder

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:32.956 A:middle
where I have my pre-trained

00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:33.356 A:middle
network.

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.976 A:middle
So what you see here is that I

00:25:35.976 --> 00:25:38.386 A:middle
have this spatial transformer

00:25:38.386 --> 00:25:39.056 A:middle
dot [inaudible] file.

00:25:39.156 --> 00:25:41.136 A:middle
This is a pre-trained Keras

00:25:41.136 --> 00:25:41.436 A:middle
model.

00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:44.056 A:middle
And if you are wondering if I

00:25:44.056 --> 00:25:45.526 A:middle
did something special to get

00:25:45.526 --> 00:25:46.756 A:middle
this model.

00:25:47.956 --> 00:25:50.536 A:middle
Basically what I did was I could

00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:52.076 A:middle
easily find an open source

00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:53.126 A:middle
implementation of spatial

00:25:53.126 --> 00:25:53.676 A:middle
transformer.

00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:55.616 A:middle
I just exhibited that script in

00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:57.046 A:middle
Keras, and I got this model.

00:25:57.646 --> 00:25:59.196 A:middle
And along with this model, I

00:25:59.196 --> 00:26:01.476 A:middle
also got this grid sampler layer
