00:31:58.756 --> 00:32:00.266 A:middle
custom description here.

00:32:01.546 --> 00:32:03.186 A:middle
Okay. Let me go back to slides.

00:32:04.516 --> 00:32:09.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.466 A:middle
So what we just saw was with a

00:32:12.466 --> 00:32:15.126 A:middle
few simple lines, we could

00:32:15.156 --> 00:32:16.386 A:middle
exhibit a convert a function to

00:32:16.546 --> 00:32:17.246 A:middle
Core ML.

00:32:17.246 --> 00:32:19.496 A:middle
And the process is pretty much

00:32:19.526 --> 00:32:21.266 A:middle
the same if you are using the

00:32:21.266 --> 00:32:23.566 A:middle
TensorFlow converter or the ONNX

00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:23.956 A:middle
converter.

00:32:25.266 --> 00:32:26.596 A:middle
So we have our model here on the

00:32:26.596 --> 00:32:27.176 A:middle
left-hand side.

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:29.286 A:middle
The custom layer model with the

00:32:29.286 --> 00:32:29.856 A:middle
parameters.

00:32:30.496 --> 00:32:31.646 A:middle
Now when you drag and drop this

00:32:31.646 --> 00:32:33.966 A:middle
model into Xcode, you will need

00:32:33.966 --> 00:32:35.336 A:middle
to provide the implementation of

00:32:35.426 --> 00:32:36.456 A:middle
the class.

00:32:36.456 --> 00:32:38.186 A:middle
In a file say, for example,

00:32:38.186 --> 00:32:38.476 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:39.536 A:middle
And this is how it would look

00:32:39.536 --> 00:32:39.726 A:middle
like.

00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:41.646 A:middle
So you have your class, so

00:32:42.006 --> 00:32:44.986 A:middle
you'll have the initializer

00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:45.706 A:middle
function.

00:32:45.996 --> 00:32:47.456 A:middle
So this would be just

00:32:47.456 --> 00:32:49.106 A:middle
initializing any parameters that

00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:50.116 A:middle
we had in the model.

00:32:50.486 --> 00:32:52.636 A:middle
And then the main function in

00:32:52.636 --> 00:32:55.906 A:middle
this class would be evaluate.

00:32:56.846 --> 00:32:58.996 A:middle
This is where the actual

00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:00.706 A:middle
implementation of whatever
