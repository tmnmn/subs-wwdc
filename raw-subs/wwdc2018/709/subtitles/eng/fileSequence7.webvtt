somehow represent these param --

00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:02.026 A:middle
these parameters using a fewer

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.456 A:middle
number of bits, we can

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.676 A:middle
drastically reduce the size of

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:05.096 A:middle
this model.

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:08.626 A:middle
In fact, this process is called

00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:09.676 A:middle
quantization.

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:12.116 A:middle
In quantization, we take the

00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:13.846 A:middle
weights for our layers which

00:07:13.846 --> 00:07:15.086 A:middle
[inaudible] to minimum and to

00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:18.816 A:middle
maximum value and we map them to

00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:19.736 A:middle
unsigned integers.

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:22.706 A:middle
Now for APIC quantization, we

00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:24.526 A:middle
map these values from a range of

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:26.686 A:middle
0 to 55.

00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:28.876 A:middle
For 7-bit quantization, we map

00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:31.826 A:middle
them from 0 to 127, all the way

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:32.556 A:middle
down to 1 bit.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.076 A:middle
Where we map these weights as

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:35.486 A:middle
either zeros or ones.

00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:37.606 A:middle
Since we're using fewer bits to

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:38.856 A:middle
represent the same information,

00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:40.476 A:middle
we reduce the size of our model.

00:07:42.406 --> 00:07:44.786 A:middle
Great. Now many of you may have

00:07:44.786 --> 00:07:46.276 A:middle
noticed that we're mapping

00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:47.246 A:middle
floats to integers.

00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:48.926 A:middle
And you may have come to the

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.046 A:middle
conclusion that maybe there's

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:52.366 A:middle
some accuracy loss in this

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:52.786 A:middle
mapping.

00:07:53.326 --> 00:07:53.836 A:middle
That's true.

00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:56.316 A:middle
The rule of thumb is the lower

00:07:56.316 --> 00:07:57.416 A:middle
the number of bits you quantize

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.226 A:middle
your model to, the more of a hit

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:00.346 A:middle
our model takes in terms of
