00:17:58.516 --> 00:18:03.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:04.136 --> 00:18:06.306 A:middle
So if you notice, all the

00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:07.696 A:middle
details about, about our

00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:10.196 A:middle
quantized model are the same as

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:10.866 A:middle
the original model.

00:18:11.226 --> 00:18:12.306 A:middle
It still takes in an image

00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:14.066 A:middle
input, and it still has two

00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:14.566 A:middle
outputs.

00:18:15.216 --> 00:18:17.046 A:middle
Now, if I had an app using this

00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:18.616 A:middle
model, what I could do as we saw

00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:19.476 A:middle
in the previous demo.

00:18:20.056 --> 00:18:21.256 A:middle
Is we could just drag this

00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:22.766 A:middle
quantized model into our app and

00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:23.876 A:middle
start using that instead.

00:18:23.876 --> 00:18:25.456 A:middle
And just like that, we reduce

00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:25.956 A:middle
the size of our app.

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.036 A:middle
So that was quantization using

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:34.906 A:middle
Core ML Tools.

00:18:38.696 --> 00:18:40.996 A:middle
To recap, we saw how easy it was

00:18:41.096 --> 00:18:43.246 A:middle
to use Core ML Tools to quantize

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:43.676 A:middle
our model.

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.466 A:middle
Using a simple API, we provided

00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:49.176 A:middle
our original model, the number

00:18:49.176 --> 00:18:50.446 A:middle
of bits we wanted to quantize

00:18:50.446 --> 00:18:51.746 A:middle
our model to, and the

00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:53.016 A:middle
quantization algorithm we wanted

00:18:53.016 --> 00:18:53.396 A:middle
to use.

00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:55.736 A:middle
We also saw that Core ML Tools

00:18:55.736 --> 00:18:57.736 A:middle
has utilities which help us to

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.476 A:middle
compare our quantized model to

00:18:59.476 --> 00:19:01.126 A:middle
see how it performs against our
