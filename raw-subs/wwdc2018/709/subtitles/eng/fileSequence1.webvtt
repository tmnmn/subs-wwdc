00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:01.516 A:middle
lots of amazing apps across all

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:02.426 A:middle
Apple platforms.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.366 A:middle
So that's really exciting.

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:07.026 A:middle
And we are even more excited

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:08.986 A:middle
with the new features that we

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:09.736 A:middle
have this year.

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:13.716 A:middle
Now you can reduce the size of

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:14.936 A:middle
your app by a lot.

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:18.376 A:middle
You can make your app much

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:20.246 A:middle
faster by using the new

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.286 A:middle
batch-predict API.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.356 A:middle
And you can really easily

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.596 A:middle
include cutting-edge research

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.246 A:middle
right in your app using

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:29.966 A:middle
customization.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:33.546 A:middle
So that was a recap of the first

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:33.926 A:middle
session.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.146 A:middle
And in case you missed it, I

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:37.466 A:middle
would highly encourage you to go

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.936 A:middle
back and check the slides.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
In this session, we are going to

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.296 A:middle
see how to actually make use of

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:47.046 A:middle
these features.

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:50.046 A:middle
More specifically, we'll walk

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:52.166 A:middle
through a few examples and show

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.606 A:middle
you that how in a few simple

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:57.466 A:middle
steps using Core ML Tools.

00:01:58.046 --> 00:01:59.486 A:middle
You can reduce the size of the

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.426 A:middle
model, and you can include a
