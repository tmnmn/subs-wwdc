00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:00.606 A:middle
can construct the lookup table

00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:02.046 A:middle
for our weights.

00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:04.116 A:middle
And what we're doing over here

00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:05.866 A:middle
is that we're iterating over all

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:06.556 A:middle
the layers in the neural

00:16:06.556 --> 00:16:06.916 A:middle
network.

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:08.496 A:middle
And we're quantizing and we're

00:16:08.496 --> 00:16:09.586 A:middle
figuring out the lookup table

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:11.426 A:middle
for that particular layer.

00:16:12.226 --> 00:16:14.626 A:middle
Now, if you're an expert and you

00:16:14.626 --> 00:16:15.836 A:middle
know that your model, you know

00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:17.586 A:middle
your model architecture and you

00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:18.826 A:middle
know that k-means is not the

00:16:18.826 --> 00:16:20.426 A:middle
algorithm for you, you have the

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:22.456 A:middle
flexibility of passing in your

00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:24.996 A:middle
own custom function instead of

00:16:24.996 --> 00:16:26.456 A:middle
this algorithm and the utility

00:16:26.456 --> 00:16:28.076 A:middle
will use your custom function to

00:16:28.076 --> 00:16:29.126 A:middle
actually construct the lookup

00:16:29.126 --> 00:16:29.436 A:middle
table.

00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:32.686 A:middle
So we finished quantizing this

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:34.036 A:middle
model again using the lookup

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:34.646 A:middle
table approach.

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:36.596 A:middle
And now let's see how well this

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:38.006 A:middle
model compares with our original

00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:38.306 A:middle
model.

00:16:38.626 --> 00:16:40.016 A:middle
So once again we call our

00:16:40.016 --> 00:16:41.286 A:middle
compare model's API.

00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:43.766 A:middle
We pass in our original model

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:46.036 A:middle
and we pass in our lookup table

00:16:46.036 --> 00:16:46.366 A:middle
model.

00:16:47.036 --> 00:16:51.036 A:middle
And again we pass in our sample

00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:51.656 A:middle
data folder.

00:16:52.266 --> 00:16:56.406 A:middle
Again, we run inference over all

00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:58.616 A:middle
the images using both the

00:16:59.596 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
original model and the quantized
