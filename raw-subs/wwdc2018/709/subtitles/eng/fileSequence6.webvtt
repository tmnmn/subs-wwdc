00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
neural network model which has

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.336 A:middle
32-bit float weight parameters.

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:05.276 A:middle
And we use Core ML Tools to

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:07.136 A:middle
quantize the weights for this

00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
model.

00:06:08.126 --> 00:06:09.556 A:middle
The resulting model is smaller

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:10.026 A:middle
in size.

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:12.346 A:middle
Now size reduction of the model

00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:13.606 A:middle
is directly dependent on the

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.296 A:middle
number of bits we quantize our

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:15.886 A:middle
model to.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.316 A:middle
Now, many of us may be wondering

00:06:19.466 --> 00:06:21.046 A:middle
what exactly is quantization?

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:22.616 A:middle
And how can it reduce the size

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:23.116 A:middle
of my models?

00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:25.786 A:middle
Let's step back and take a peek

00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:26.246 A:middle
under the hood.

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:31.986 A:middle
Neural networks are composed of

00:06:31.986 --> 00:06:32.336 A:middle
layers.

00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:33.906 A:middle
And these layers can be thought

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:35.336 A:middle
of as mathematical functions.

00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:37.356 A:middle
And these mathematical functions

00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:38.876 A:middle
have parameters called weights.

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:41.116 A:middle
And these weights are usually

00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:42.716 A:middle
stored as 32-bit floats.

00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:45.886 A:middle
Now in our previous session, we

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:47.206 A:middle
took a look at ResNet50.

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:49.036 A:middle
A popular machine-learning model

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:50.116 A:middle
which is used for image

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:51.536 A:middle
classification amongst other

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:51.816 A:middle
things.

00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:53.576 A:middle
Now this particular model has

00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:55.696 A:middle
over 25 million weight

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:56.286 A:middle
parameters.

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:58.286 A:middle
So you can imagine, if you could

00:06:58.286 --> 00:07:00.206 A:middle
somehow represent these param --
