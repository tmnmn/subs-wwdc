00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:33.126 A:middle
So welcome to the second session

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:34.696 A:middle
of Core ML.

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:36.246 A:middle
My name is Aseem, and I'm an

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.806 A:middle
engineer in the Core ML team.

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.526 A:middle
As you all know, Core ML is

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:44.486 A:middle
Apple's machine learning

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:45.976 A:middle
framework for on-device

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:46.406 A:middle
inference.

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:49.906 A:middle
And the one thing I really like

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:51.416 A:middle
about Core ML is that it's

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:53.846 A:middle
optimized on all Apple hardware.

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:58.116 A:middle
Over the last year, we have seen

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:01.516 A:middle
lots of amazing apps across all
