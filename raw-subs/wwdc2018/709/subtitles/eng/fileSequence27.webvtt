00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.366 A:middle
And now I will load the model in

00:27:00.406 --> 00:27:00.926 A:middle
Keras.

00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:04.656 A:middle
Okay? So this is how you load

00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:06.196 A:middle
model, Keras models.

00:27:06.196 --> 00:27:07.506 A:middle
You give the part to the model

00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:08.536 A:middle
and if there's a custom layer,

00:27:08.536 --> 00:27:09.796 A:middle
you give a part to that.

00:27:11.016 --> 00:27:12.886 A:middle
Okay. So we have the model now.

00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:14.276 A:middle
Now let's convert this to Core

00:27:14.276 --> 00:27:14.466 A:middle
ML.

00:27:15.656 --> 00:27:16.986 A:middle
So I'm going to import Core ML

00:27:16.986 --> 00:27:17.626 A:middle
Tools.

00:27:18.356 --> 00:27:19.076 A:middle
Execute that.

00:27:19.896 --> 00:27:22.106 A:middle
And now as I, as I showed you

00:27:22.106 --> 00:27:24.156 A:middle
before that this is just a call

00:27:24.156 --> 00:27:25.626 A:middle
to one function to convert it.

00:27:26.086 --> 00:27:26.966 A:middle
So let me do that.

00:27:28.476 --> 00:27:29.196 A:middle
That's my call.

00:27:29.776 --> 00:27:32.086 A:middle
And I get an error as expected.

00:27:32.626 --> 00:27:35.096 A:middle
Python likes to throw these huge

00:27:35.096 --> 00:27:35.696 A:middle
error messages.

00:27:36.136 --> 00:27:37.946 A:middle
But really what we're focused on

00:27:38.666 --> 00:27:40.076 A:middle
is this last line.

00:27:40.336 --> 00:27:40.896 A:middle
Let me --

00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:47.906 A:middle
So as we can see in this last

00:27:47.906 --> 00:27:49.676 A:middle
line it says that hey, the layer

00:27:49.676 --> 00:27:51.326 A:middle
or sampler is not supported.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.146 A:middle
So now let's see what we need to

00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:55.126 A:middle
do to get rid of that.

00:27:55.756 --> 00:27:57.066 A:middle
Maybe I clear this all so that

00:27:57.066 --> 00:27:57.466 A:middle
you can see.

00:27:57.786 --> 00:27:59.616 A:middle
Okay. So now I change my

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:00.956 A:middle
converter call just a little bit
