00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:00.956 A:middle
converter call just a little bit

00:28:01.176 --> 00:28:03.046 A:middle
so I have my Core ML model.

00:28:03.646 --> 00:28:08.096 A:middle
And now I'm going to pass one

00:28:08.096 --> 00:28:08.946 A:middle
additional argument.

00:28:09.176 --> 00:28:14.176 A:middle
It's called custom conversion

00:28:14.576 --> 00:28:14.976 A:middle
functions.

00:28:19.396 --> 00:28:20.676 A:middle
And this will be a dictionary

00:28:21.396 --> 00:28:23.796 A:middle
from the name of the layer to a

00:28:23.796 --> 00:28:25.496 A:middle
function that I will define in a

00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:25.826 A:middle
minute.

00:28:26.186 --> 00:28:27.066 A:middle
And that I'm calling a good

00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:27.386 A:middle
sampler.

00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:29.006 A:middle
So let me take a step back and

00:28:29.006 --> 00:28:30.026 A:middle
explain what is happening here.

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:31.796 A:middle
So as we know the way converter

00:28:31.796 --> 00:28:34.126 A:middle
works is that it goes through

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:35.666 A:middle
each and every Keras layer.

00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:38.386 A:middle
It will, if you look at the

00:28:38.476 --> 00:28:38.986 A:middle
first layer.

00:28:38.986 --> 00:28:40.046 A:middle
Then [inaudible] its parameters

00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:40.666 A:middle
to Core ML.

00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:41.816 A:middle
If you go to the second layer,

00:28:41.816 --> 00:28:43.146 A:middle
then translate its parameters

00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:44.306 A:middle
and so on.

00:28:44.676 --> 00:28:45.936 A:middle
Now when it hits this custom

00:28:45.936 --> 00:28:46.886 A:middle
layer, it doesn't know what to

00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:47.146 A:middle
do.

00:28:47.756 --> 00:28:49.446 A:middle
So this function that I'm

00:28:49.446 --> 00:28:50.886 A:middle
passing here that convert this

00:28:50.936 --> 00:28:53.246 A:middle
sampler is going to help my

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:54.256 A:middle
converter in doing that.

00:28:54.876 --> 00:28:56.316 A:middle
And let me show you what this

00:28:56.316 --> 00:28:56.976 A:middle
function looks like.
