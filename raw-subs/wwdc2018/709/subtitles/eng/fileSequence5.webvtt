Core ML Tools ecosystem.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.496 A:middle
Now to talk about quantization,

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:04.446 A:middle
I would like to invite my friend

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:05.476 A:middle
Sohaib on stage.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:13.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:14.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:15.976 A:middle
My name is Sohaib.

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:17.426 A:middle
I'm an engineer in the Core ML

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:17.716 A:middle
team.

00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:19.156 A:middle
And today we're going to be

00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:20.256 A:middle
taking a look at new

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:21.766 A:middle
quantization utilities in Core

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:23.026 A:middle
ML Tools 2.0.

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:29.826 A:middle
Core ML Tools 2.0 has support

00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:31.206 A:middle
for the latest Core ML model

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.366 A:middle
format specification.

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:34.306 A:middle
It also has utilities which make

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:36.166 A:middle
it really easy for you to add

00:05:36.226 --> 00:05:38.016 A:middle
flexible shapes and quantize in

00:05:38.016 --> 00:05:38.876 A:middle
your own network machine

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:39.486 A:middle
learning models.

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:41.416 A:middle
Using these great new features

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.046 A:middle
in Core ML, you can not only

00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:44.266 A:middle
reduce the size of your models.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:46.366 A:middle
But also reduce the number of

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:48.126 A:middle
models in your app, reducing the

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:49.536 A:middle
footprint of your app.

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:51.896 A:middle
Now let's start off by taking a

00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:53.316 A:middle
look at quantization.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:55.876 A:middle
Core ML Tools supports

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:57.166 A:middle
post-training quantization.

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:59.186 A:middle
We start off with a Core ML

00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:00.976 A:middle
neural network model which has
