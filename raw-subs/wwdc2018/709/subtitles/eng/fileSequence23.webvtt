00:23:01.426 --> 00:23:02.776 A:middle
So let's say you have an image

00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:03.426 A:middle
classifier.

00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:05.846 A:middle
This is how it looks in Xcode.

00:23:06.246 --> 00:23:07.096 A:middle
So it will be high-level

00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:08.316 A:middle
description of the model.

00:23:08.886 --> 00:23:11.136 A:middle
If you look inside, it's very

00:23:11.136 --> 00:23:12.166 A:middle
likely that it's a neural

00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:12.606 A:middle
network.

00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:14.456 A:middle
And it's very likely that it's a

00:23:14.456 --> 00:23:16.116 A:middle
convolutional neural network.

00:23:16.116 --> 00:23:17.416 A:middle
So it has a lot of layers,

00:23:17.656 --> 00:23:19.396 A:middle
convolution, activation.

00:23:20.346 --> 00:23:22.386 A:middle
Now it might happen that there's

00:23:22.386 --> 00:23:23.526 A:middle
a new activation layer that

00:23:23.556 --> 00:23:24.856 A:middle
comes up that Core ML does not

00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:25.206 A:middle
support.

00:23:25.846 --> 00:23:29.066 A:middle
And it's like at every machine

00:23:29.066 --> 00:23:30.916 A:middle
learning conference, researchers

00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:32.046 A:middle
are coming up with new layers

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:32.516 A:middle
all the time.

00:23:32.596 --> 00:23:33.476 A:middle
So this is a very common

00:23:33.476 --> 00:23:33.906 A:middle
scenario.

00:23:33.906 --> 00:23:37.356 A:middle
Now if this happens, you only

00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:39.306 A:middle
need to use a custom

00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:40.566 A:middle
implementation of this new

00:23:40.566 --> 00:23:40.886 A:middle
layer.

00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:42.256 A:middle
And then you are good to go.

00:23:42.716 --> 00:23:43.796 A:middle
So this is how the model will

00:23:43.796 --> 00:23:44.246 A:middle
look like.

00:23:44.246 --> 00:23:46.096 A:middle
The only difference is this

00:23:46.096 --> 00:23:48.016 A:middle
dependency section at the

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:49.446 A:middle
bottom.

00:23:49.446 --> 00:23:52.416 A:middle
Which would say that this model

00:23:52.416 --> 00:23:53.976 A:middle
contains a description of this

00:23:54.026 --> 00:23:54.476 A:middle
custom layer.

00:23:54.856 --> 00:23:56.246 A:middle
Let's take a look at another

00:23:56.246 --> 00:23:56.746 A:middle
example.

00:23:57.056 --> 00:23:58.576 A:middle
Let's say we have a very simple

00:23:58.906 --> 00:23:59.946 A:middle
digit classifier.
