00:20:00.126 --> 00:20:03.686 A:middle
So on the top, top left here,

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:04.276 A:middle
your left.

00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:06.536 A:middle
We see that original model is 30

00:20:06.686 --> 00:20:09.306 A:middle
-- is 32 bits and it's 6.7

00:20:09.306 --> 00:20:10.186 A:middle
megabytes in size.

00:20:10.326 --> 00:20:12.106 A:middle
And our 8-bit linearly quantized

00:20:12.106 --> 00:20:14.146 A:middle
model is only 1.7 megabits in

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:14.446 A:middle
size.

00:20:14.776 --> 00:20:16.016 A:middle
And we see that the performance

00:20:16.486 --> 00:20:18.256 A:middle
by visual inspection it's good

00:20:18.256 --> 00:20:19.406 A:middle
enough for my style transfer

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:19.746 A:middle
demo.

00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:23.176 A:middle
Now we can see that even down to

00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:25.016 A:middle
4 bits, we don't lose out much

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:25.896 A:middle
in the way of performance.

00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:27.736 A:middle
I would even argue that for my

00:20:27.736 --> 00:20:29.256 A:middle
app at least, the 3 bit will

00:20:29.256 --> 00:20:30.066 A:middle
work fine as well.

00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:32.946 A:middle
And we see at 2 bit, we start to

00:20:32.946 --> 00:20:34.886 A:middle
see a lot of artifacts and this

00:20:34.886 --> 00:20:36.406 A:middle
may not be the right model for

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:37.303 A:middle
us.

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.406 A:middle
And that was quantization using

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:41.186 A:middle
Core ML Tools.

00:20:42.146 --> 00:20:43.056 A:middle
Now I'm going to hand it back to

00:20:43.056 --> 00:20:44.836 A:middle
Aseem who's going to talk about

00:20:44.836 --> 00:20:45.596 A:middle
custom conversion.

00:20:45.596 --> 00:20:45.936 A:middle
Thank you.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:51.846 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:52.346 --> 00:20:52.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sohaib.

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:56.136 A:middle
So I want to talk about a

00:20:56.266 --> 00:20:58.396 A:middle
feature that is essential to

00:20:58.396 --> 00:20:59.706 A:middle
keep pace with the machine

00:20:59.706 --> 00:21:00.546 A:middle
learning research that's
