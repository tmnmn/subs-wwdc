00:11:59.536 --> 00:12:01.186 A:middle
Now the second thing I want to

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:02.576 A:middle
do is I want to import all the

00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:03.906 A:middle
new quantization utilities that

00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:04.966 A:middle
we have in Core ML Tools.

00:12:05.026 --> 00:12:06.976 A:middle
And we do that by running this.

00:12:16.206 --> 00:12:17.516 A:middle
And now we need to load up the

00:12:17.516 --> 00:12:18.866 A:middle
model which we want to quantize.

00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:20.376 A:middle
And we just saw the SqueezeNet

00:12:20.376 --> 00:12:21.126 A:middle
model a minute okay.

00:12:21.126 --> 00:12:22.106 A:middle
We're going to go ahead and get

00:12:22.106 --> 00:12:22.976 A:middle
an instance of that model.

00:12:32.056 --> 00:12:37.716 A:middle
Send this to my desktop.

00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:40.416 A:middle
Great. Now to quantize this

00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:41.996 A:middle
model, we just need to make one

00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:43.056 A:middle
simple API call.

00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:44.666 A:middle
And let's try a linear,

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:46.166 A:middle
quantizing this model using

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:47.256 A:middle
linear quantization.

00:12:51.176 --> 00:12:53.166 A:middle
And its API is simply called

00:12:53.456 --> 00:12:54.346 A:middle
quantize weights.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.216 A:middle
And the first parameter we pass

00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:58.236 A:middle
in is the original model which

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.396 A:middle
you just loaded up.

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:00.996 A:middle
The number of bits we want to
