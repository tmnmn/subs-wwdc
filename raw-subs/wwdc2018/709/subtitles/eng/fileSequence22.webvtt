00:21:58.826 --> 00:22:00.596 A:middle
your app.

00:22:00.866 --> 00:22:02.496 A:middle
So let's take a look at model

00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:02.956 A:middle
conversion.

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:05.396 A:middle
So if you have used one of our

00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:06.916 A:middle
converters, or even if you have

00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.996 A:middle
not, it's a really simple API.

00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:10.276 A:middle
It's just a call to one

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:10.706 A:middle
function.

00:22:11.146 --> 00:22:14.096 A:middle
This is how it looks for the

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.076 A:middle
Keras converter.

00:22:15.466 --> 00:22:17.536 A:middle
And it's very similar for say

00:22:17.656 --> 00:22:19.396 A:middle
the ONNX converter or the

00:22:19.396 --> 00:22:21.416 A:middle
TensorFlow converter.

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:22.976 A:middle
Now when you call this function,

00:22:23.406 --> 00:22:25.626 A:middle
mostly everything goes right.

00:22:26.006 --> 00:22:27.656 A:middle
But sometimes you might get an

00:22:27.776 --> 00:22:29.156 A:middle
error message like this.

00:22:30.496 --> 00:22:32.826 A:middle
It might say, "Hey, unsupported

00:22:32.826 --> 00:22:34.146 A:middle
operation of such-and-such

00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:34.366 A:middle
kind."

00:22:35.086 --> 00:22:37.546 A:middle
Now if that happens to you, you

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:39.286 A:middle
only need to do a little bit

00:22:39.286 --> 00:22:40.886 A:middle
more to get past this error.

00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:43.576 A:middle
More specifically, such an error

00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:44.896 A:middle
message is an indication that

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:47.166 A:middle
you should be using a custom

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:47.346 A:middle
layer.

00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:50.556 A:middle
And before I show you what is

00:22:50.556 --> 00:22:51.946 A:middle
the little bit of extra effort

00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:53.016 A:middle
that you need to do to convert,

00:22:53.016 --> 00:22:55.816 A:middle
let's look at a few examples

00:22:55.816 --> 00:22:57.156 A:middle
where you would need to use a

00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:57.656 A:middle
custom layer.
