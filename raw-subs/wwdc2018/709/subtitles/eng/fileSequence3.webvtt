00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:00.646 A:middle
machine learning expert to use

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:00.816 A:middle
it.

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:02.496 A:middle
It's really easy to use.

00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:03.786 A:middle
It's right there in Xcode.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:06.936 A:middle
So go and give it a try.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.316 A:middle
Now some of you are already

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.326 A:middle
familiar with the amazing

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:13.416 A:middle
machine learning tools that we

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:15.516 A:middle
have outside in the community.

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:19.036 A:middle
And for that, last year we had

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.406 A:middle
released Core ML Tools, a Python

00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:21.956 A:middle
package.

00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:24.306 A:middle
And along with that, we had

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:26.786 A:middle
released a few converters.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:30.036 A:middle
Now there has been a lot of

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:31.606 A:middle
activity in this area over the

00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:32.236 A:middle
last year.

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:34.436 A:middle
And this is how the picture

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:34.976 A:middle
looks now.

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:38.936 A:middle
So as you can see, there are

00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:42.416 A:middle
many more converters out there.

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:44.526 A:middle
And you really do have a lot of

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:46.306 A:middle
choice to choose your training

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:47.016 A:middle
framework now.

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.346 A:middle
And all of these converters are

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.546 A:middle
built on top of Core ML Tools.

00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:57.326 A:middle
Now, I do want to highlight a

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:58.816 A:middle
couple of different converters

00:03:58.816 --> 00:03:59.056 A:middle
here.
