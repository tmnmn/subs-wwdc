00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:02.356 A:middle
As we can see, this model is 5

00:11:02.356 --> 00:11:03.226 A:middle
megabytes in size.

00:11:03.616 --> 00:11:05.986 A:middle
It has a input which is an image

00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:08.456 A:middle
of 227 by 227 pixels.

00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:09.796 A:middle
And it has two outputs.

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:11.776 A:middle
One of the outputs is the class

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:13.696 A:middle
label which is a string, and

00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:15.996 A:middle
this is the most likely label

00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:17.416 A:middle
for the, for the input image.

00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:19.386 A:middle
And the second output is a

00:11:19.386 --> 00:11:20.526 A:middle
mapping of strings to

00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:23.386 A:middle
probabilities given that if we

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:24.756 A:middle
pass an image, it's going to be

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:25.976 A:middle
a list of probabilities of what

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:26.666 A:middle
that image may be.

00:11:28.826 --> 00:11:30.126 A:middle
Now let's start quantizing this

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:30.486 A:middle
model.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:32.696 A:middle
So the first thing I want to do

00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:34.066 A:middle
is I want to get into a Python

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:34.556 A:middle
environment.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.406 A:middle
Now a Jupyter Notebook is one

00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:37.206 A:middle
such environment that I'm

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:37.776 A:middle
comfortable with.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.086 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:11:39.086 --> 00:11:39.526 A:middle
open that up.

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:49.346 A:middle
Let's open up a new notebook and

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:50.496 A:middle
zoom in on that.

00:11:51.346 --> 00:11:53.476 A:middle
Alright. So let's start off by

00:11:53.476 --> 00:11:54.926 A:middle
importing Core ML Tools.

00:11:58.476 --> 00:11:59.536 A:middle
Let's run that.

00:11:59.536 --> 00:12:01.186 A:middle
Now the second thing I want to
