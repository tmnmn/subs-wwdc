00:25:59.196 --> 00:26:01.476 A:middle
also got this grid sampler layer

00:26:01.646 --> 00:26:02.436 A:middle
Python script.

00:26:03.206 --> 00:26:04.936 A:middle
Now this grid sampler layer that

00:26:04.936 --> 00:26:07.086 A:middle
I'm talking about, it's also not

00:26:07.086 --> 00:26:08.676 A:middle
supported on Keras natively.

00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:11.376 A:middle
So the implementation that I got

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:13.666 A:middle
online used that Keras custom

00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:15.666 A:middle
layer to implement the layer.

00:26:16.376 --> 00:26:18.496 A:middle
So as you can see, the concept

00:26:18.496 --> 00:26:20.046 A:middle
of customization is not unique

00:26:20.046 --> 00:26:20.606 A:middle
to Core ML.

00:26:20.806 --> 00:26:22.986 A:middle
In fact, it's very common in

00:26:22.986 --> 00:26:23.816 A:middle
most machine learning

00:26:23.816 --> 00:26:24.416 A:middle
frameworks.

00:26:24.756 --> 00:26:26.556 A:middle
This is how people experiment in

00:26:26.556 --> 00:26:27.086 A:middle
new layers.

00:26:27.966 --> 00:26:29.956 A:middle
Okay, so so far, I just have a

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:30.636 A:middle
Keras model.

00:26:30.826 --> 00:26:32.306 A:middle
And now I want to focus on how

00:26:32.306 --> 00:26:33.666 A:middle
can I get a Core ML model?

00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:40.716 A:middle
So I'll open -- there, let me

00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:42.506 A:middle
launch a new Python notebook.

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:46.176 A:middle
So I'll start by importing this

00:26:46.226 --> 00:26:47.526 A:middle
Keras model into my Python

00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:48.086 A:middle
environment.

00:26:49.396 --> 00:26:53.576 A:middle
Okay? So I import Keras, I

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:56.676 A:middle
import the, the custom layer

00:26:56.676 --> 00:26:57.976 A:middle
that we have in Keras.

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.366 A:middle
And now I will load the model in
