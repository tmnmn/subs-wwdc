00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.426 A:middle
model, and you can include a

00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:02.846 A:middle
custom feature in your model.

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:05.566 A:middle
Here's the agenda of the

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:05.966 A:middle
session.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:08.556 A:middle
We'll start by a really quick

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:10.166 A:middle
update on the Core ML Tools

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:10.816 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.586 A:middle
And then we'll dive into a demo

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:16.866 A:middle
of our quantization and custom

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:17.346 A:middle
conversion.

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:18.846 A:middle
So let me start with the

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:19.356 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.306 A:middle
So how do you get an ML model?

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.846 A:middle
Well, the best thing is that if

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:32.986 A:middle
you, if you can, if you find it

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.036 A:middle
online, you just download it,

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:36.406 A:middle
right?

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.616 A:middle
Very good place to download your

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:41.176 A:middle
ML models is the Apple Machine

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.366 A:middle
Learning landing page.

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:44.206 A:middle
We have a few models there.

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:46.836 A:middle
Now let's say you want to train

00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:48.456 A:middle
a model on your data set.

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:51.746 A:middle
In that case, you can use Create

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:52.546 A:middle
ML.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.336 A:middle
This is a new framework that we

00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:56.976 A:middle
have just launched this year,

00:02:57.436 --> 00:02:59.206 A:middle
and you do not have to be a

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:00.646 A:middle
machine learning expert to use
