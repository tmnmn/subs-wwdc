00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:01.326 A:middle
quantization, how do I construct

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:02.036 A:middle
my lookup table?

00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:04.426 A:middle
I'm here to tell you that you

00:10:04.426 --> 00:10:05.946 A:middle
don't have to worry about any of

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:06.236 A:middle
that.

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:08.536 A:middle
All you do is decide on the

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:09.546 A:middle
number of bits you want to

00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:10.596 A:middle
quantize your model to.

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:11.926 A:middle
And decide on the algorithm you

00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:13.706 A:middle
want to use, and let Core ML

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:15.166 A:middle
Tools do the rest.

00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:16.576 A:middle
In fact --

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:22.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:24.756 A:middle
In fact, it's so simple to take

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:26.186 A:middle
a Core ML neural network model.

00:10:26.286 --> 00:10:27.036 A:middle
And quantize it.

00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:29.116 A:middle
Then we can do it in a few lines

00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:29.806 A:middle
of Python code.

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.286 A:middle
But why stand here and talk

00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:32.396 A:middle
about it when we can show you a

00:10:32.396 --> 00:10:32.676 A:middle
demo?

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.296 A:middle
So for the purposes of this

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:44.346 A:middle
demo, I'm going to need a neural

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:45.596 A:middle
network in the Core ML model

00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:46.026 A:middle
format.

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:47.846 A:middle
Now, as my colleague Aseem

00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:49.376 A:middle
mentioned, a great place to find

00:10:49.376 --> 00:10:50.686 A:middle
these models is on the Core ML

00:10:50.686 --> 00:10:51.716 A:middle
machine learning home page.

00:10:52.056 --> 00:10:52.896 A:middle
And I've gone ahead and

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.016 A:middle
downloaded one of the models

00:10:54.106 --> 00:10:54.846 A:middle
from that page.

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:56.706 A:middle
So this model's called

00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:57.176 A:middle
SqueezeNet.

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:58.146 A:middle
And let's go ahead and open it

00:10:58.146 --> 00:10:58.296 A:middle
up.

00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:02.356 A:middle
As we can see, this model is 5
