Tools and that's great for you

00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
guys.

00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:01.346 A:middle
Because now you have lot of

00:34:01.436 --> 00:34:03.416 A:middle
choice to get Core ML models

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:03.726 A:middle
from.

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:06.526 A:middle
We saw how easy it was to

00:34:06.846 --> 00:34:09.666 A:middle
quantize this, quantize Core ML

00:34:09.666 --> 00:34:10.235 A:middle
model.

00:34:10.716 --> 00:34:12.485 A:middle
And we saw that with a few lines

00:34:13.156 --> 00:34:16.565 A:middle
of code, we could easily

00:34:16.565 --> 00:34:18.295 A:middle
integrate a new custom layer in

00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:20.456 A:middle
the model.

00:34:20.806 --> 00:34:22.136 A:middle
You can find more information at

00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:23.206 A:middle
our documentation page.

00:34:23.596 --> 00:34:25.476 A:middle
And come to the labs and talk to

00:34:25.476 --> 00:34:25.626 A:middle
us.

00:34:26.176 --> 00:34:26.966 A:middle
Okay, thank you.
