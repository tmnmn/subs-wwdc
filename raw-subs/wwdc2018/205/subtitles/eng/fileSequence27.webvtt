00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:00.366 A:middle
code.

00:27:01.696 --> 00:27:03.326 A:middle
The first thing you're going to

00:27:03.326 --> 00:27:04.866 A:middle
want to do is request motion

00:27:04.906 --> 00:27:06.586 A:middle
authorization from the user in

00:27:06.586 --> 00:27:07.936 A:middle
order to use their movement

00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:08.556 A:middle
disorder data.

00:27:09.956 --> 00:27:12.416 A:middle
Once you've done that, you'll

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:13.906 A:middle
want to call the monitorKinesias

00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:15.976 A:middle
function in order to enable

00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:16.816 A:middle
symptom monitoring.

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.376 A:middle
Now, this symptom monitoring

00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:21.296 A:middle
does turn on additional Apple

00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:23.196 A:middle
Watch sensors, so this will have

00:27:23.196 --> 00:27:24.846 A:middle
an impact on the battery life of

00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:26.286 A:middle
your users, though they should

00:27:26.286 --> 00:27:27.806 A:middle
still be able to have a days'

00:27:27.806 --> 00:27:28.876 A:middle
worth of data collection on a

00:27:28.876 --> 00:27:29.566 A:middle
single charge.

00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:33.216 A:middle
As you can see, the maximum

00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:34.476 A:middle
recording duration is seven

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:34.806 A:middle
days.

00:27:35.636 --> 00:27:36.586 A:middle
I know that many of you are

00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:37.706 A:middle
going to be conducting studies

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:39.176 A:middle
that are longer than seven days,

00:27:39.526 --> 00:27:41.086 A:middle
and if that's the case, simply

00:27:41.156 --> 00:27:42.346 A:middle
call the monitorKinesias

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:44.226 A:middle
function again in order to

00:27:44.226 --> 00:27:45.476 A:middle
extend your data collection

00:27:45.476 --> 00:27:45.776 A:middle
interval.

00:27:46.896 --> 00:27:49.696 A:middle
This will begin to store tremor

00:27:49.696 --> 00:27:51.376 A:middle
and dyskinesia results on the

00:27:51.376 --> 00:27:53.086 A:middle
user's device, on your behalf.

00:27:54.226 --> 00:27:55.766 A:middle
At a certain point afterwards,

00:27:55.766 --> 00:27:56.666 A:middle
you're going to want to return

00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:58.146 A:middle
to that application so you can

00:27:58.146 --> 00:27:59.046 A:middle
query for those records.

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:00.446 A:middle
Let's take a look at what the
