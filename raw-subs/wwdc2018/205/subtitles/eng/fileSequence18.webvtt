00:17:58.146 --> 00:18:00.446 A:middle
evaluate the speech patterns for

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.036 A:middle
various medical conditions,

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:07.196 A:middle
including cognition and mood.

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:09.446 A:middle
Our next task, Interestingly, is

00:18:09.446 --> 00:18:12.126 A:middle
a combination of speech and

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:12.536 A:middle
hearing.

00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:15.626 A:middle
The speech and noise Active

00:18:16.186 --> 00:18:16.376 A:middle
Task.

00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:18.786 A:middle
This allows you to perform fully

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:20.446 A:middle
automated speech audiometry.

00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:24.176 A:middle
And conventional tone audiometry

00:18:24.176 --> 00:18:26.006 A:middle
uses pure tones, which are

00:18:26.006 --> 00:18:27.396 A:middle
essentially sign waves.

00:18:28.176 --> 00:18:29.276 A:middle
Now, there have been recorded

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:30.896 A:middle
instances, where users are able

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.656 A:middle
to clearly distinguish pure

00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:34.066 A:middle
tones, but find it extremely

00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:35.976 A:middle
difficult to distinguish words

00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:37.366 A:middle
when they are intermixed with

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:37.806 A:middle
noise.

00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:40.686 A:middle
And this closely reflects

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:42.596 A:middle
real-world examples of

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.536 A:middle
early-stage hearing loss.

00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.786 A:middle
For example, when you are unable

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.576 A:middle
to understand what the person

00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:49.546 A:middle
sitting in front of you is

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:51.086 A:middle
telling you in a noisy

00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:51.686 A:middle
restaurant.

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.426 A:middle
Now, before I go into further

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.406 A:middle
details let's take a look at how

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:57.976 A:middle
this task actually works.
