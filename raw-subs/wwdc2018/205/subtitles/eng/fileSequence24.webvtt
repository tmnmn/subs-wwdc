00:24:00.516 --> 00:24:02.256 A:middle
Parkinson's is a degenerative

00:24:02.386 --> 00:24:04.416 A:middle
neurological disorder which can

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:05.726 A:middle
affect the motor functions of

00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:06.696 A:middle
those with the disease.

00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:09.606 A:middle
One of the identifiable symptoms

00:24:09.606 --> 00:24:11.666 A:middle
of Parkinson's is a tremor.

00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:14.016 A:middle
And this API monitors for tremor

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:16.746 A:middle
at rest, characterized by a

00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:19.946 A:middle
shaking, or a trembling of the

00:24:19.946 --> 00:24:22.506 A:middle
body when somebody is not

00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:23.406 A:middle
intending to move.

00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:26.736 A:middle
Now, there are treatments

00:24:27.076 --> 00:24:28.956 A:middle
including medications, which can

00:24:28.956 --> 00:24:31.076 A:middle
help suppress and control the

00:24:31.076 --> 00:24:32.016 A:middle
symptoms of Parkinson's.

00:24:32.706 --> 00:24:34.436 A:middle
However, these very same

00:24:34.436 --> 00:24:35.506 A:middle
treatments can often have

00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:36.856 A:middle
negative side effects.

00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:39.036 A:middle
Side effects such as

00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:40.646 A:middle
dyskinesias.

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:43.406 A:middle
And one dyskinetic symptom that

00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:45.486 A:middle
this API is able to monitor for

00:24:45.936 --> 00:24:47.886 A:middle
is a fidgeting or swaying of the

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:49.406 A:middle
body known as choreiform

00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:49.756 A:middle
movement.

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:54.306 A:middle
So, to recap, you have tremor, a

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:56.406 A:middle
symptom of the disease as well

00:24:56.406 --> 00:24:58.886 A:middle
as dyskinesia, a side effect of

00:24:58.886 --> 00:24:59.406 A:middle
the treatment.
