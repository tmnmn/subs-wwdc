00:31:03.046 --> 00:31:04.586 A:middle
Here's my Xcode workspace, and

00:31:04.586 --> 00:31:05.886 A:middle
as you can see, in my

00:31:05.886 --> 00:31:07.426 A:middle
ResearchKit, I now have ORK

00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:08.336 A:middle
Parkinson's Study App.

00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:09.776 A:middle
We have a task list

00:31:09.776 --> 00:31:11.426 A:middle
viewController, where we'll be

00:31:11.426 --> 00:31:12.796 A:middle
adding all our Active Tasks and

00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:13.246 A:middle
questionnaires.

00:31:13.856 --> 00:31:15.376 A:middle
A graphviewController, where

00:31:15.376 --> 00:31:16.626 A:middle
we'll be visualizing these

00:31:16.626 --> 00:31:17.696 A:middle
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:31:17.696 --> 00:31:18.186 A:middle
data points.

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:20.066 A:middle
And an assessment manager, where

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:21.246 A:middle
we will be implementing the

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.876 A:middle
movement disorder API.

00:31:23.596 --> 00:31:24.986 A:middle
When a Parkinson's disease

00:31:25.026 --> 00:31:26.606 A:middle
patient, or a PD patient visits

00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:28.136 A:middle
their doctor, they're asked a

00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:29.656 A:middle
certain set of questions, and

00:31:29.656 --> 00:31:30.876 A:middle
these questions include

00:31:30.876 --> 00:31:31.996 A:middle
questions about their activities

00:31:31.996 --> 00:31:33.076 A:middle
of daily life, something for

00:31:33.076 --> 00:31:34.876 A:middle
example on a scale of 0 to 10,

00:31:35.096 --> 00:31:36.116 A:middle
how is your pain level today.

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:38.086 A:middle
Or, what kind of non-motor

00:31:38.086 --> 00:31:38.946 A:middle
symptoms are you feeling?

00:31:38.946 --> 00:31:41.016 A:middle
We have already added a subset

00:31:41.016 --> 00:31:42.226 A:middle
of such questions in our app.

00:31:42.876 --> 00:31:44.396 A:middle
Now, these questionnaires are

00:31:44.396 --> 00:31:45.416 A:middle
usually followed by seven

00:31:45.416 --> 00:31:46.126 A:middle
physical tests.

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:47.636 A:middle
And one of the physical tests is

00:31:47.666 --> 00:31:48.976 A:middle
assessing the clarity of speech.

00:31:49.436 --> 00:31:50.876 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and add the

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:52.196 A:middle
speech recognition Active Task.

00:31:53.526 --> 00:31:54.806 A:middle
In my task list view controller,

00:31:55.616 --> 00:31:57.106 A:middle
I'll go ahead and add the speech

00:31:57.106 --> 00:31:58.066 A:middle
recognition Active Task.

00:31:58.676 --> 00:31:59.886 A:middle
And as you can see, we just

00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:01.426 A:middle
added an ORK ordered task of
