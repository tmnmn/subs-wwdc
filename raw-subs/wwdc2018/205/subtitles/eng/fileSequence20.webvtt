Now, speech reception threshold,

00:20:00.126 --> 00:20:02.506 A:middle
is defined as the minimum value

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:04.836 A:middle
in SNR at which a user can

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:06.726 A:middle
understand only 50% of the

00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:09.916 A:middle
spoken words.

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:12.676 A:middle
Now, our vision for this test is

00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:14.286 A:middle
over the next few weeks, we'll

00:20:14.286 --> 00:20:17.126 A:middle
be uploading over 175 different

00:20:17.126 --> 00:20:20.296 A:middle
files that corresponds to 25

00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:22.126 A:middle
lists, each with 7 sentences.

00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:24.566 A:middle
And in the long-run, we want to

00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:26.356 A:middle
be able to support this test for

00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:28.676 A:middle
multiple languages, especially

00:20:28.676 --> 00:20:30.506 A:middle
ones where currently speech and

00:20:30.506 --> 00:20:32.856 A:middle
noise is not possible due to a

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.816 A:middle
lack of speech database or other

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:35.926 A:middle
testing resources.

00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.296 A:middle
So, if you are a researcher in

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:39.886 A:middle
this particular field and if you

00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:41.226 A:middle
have a request for specific

00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:43.576 A:middle
locale, I highly encourage you

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.306 A:middle
to reach out to us and we'll do

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.396 A:middle
our best to accommodate your

00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:46.896 A:middle
request.

00:20:46.896 --> 00:20:50.886 A:middle
To add this to your app, you

00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:51.926 A:middle
create an instance of

00:20:51.926 --> 00:20:54.466 A:middle
ORKSpeechInNoiseStep, and point

00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:55.706 A:middle
us to the audio file that you

00:20:55.706 --> 00:20:56.296 A:middle
wish to play.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.616 A:middle
You can also specify the gain

00:20:58.616 --> 00:20:59.966 A:middle
applied to the noise signal.
