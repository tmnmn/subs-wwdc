00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.126 A:middle
calling the query tremor method

00:33:01.306 --> 00:33:02.436 A:middle
for a given start date and an

00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:04.006 A:middle
end date, and the query

00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:05.636 A:middle
dyskinesia symptoms method, for

00:33:05.636 --> 00:33:07.066 A:middle
the same start date and the end

00:33:07.516 --> 00:33:07.626 A:middle
date.

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:10.936 A:middle
For this demo, we have already

00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:12.466 A:middle
ran this query and collected the

00:33:12.466 --> 00:33:13.616 A:middle
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:33:13.616 --> 00:33:14.686 A:middle
data points and saved them as

00:33:14.716 --> 00:33:15.566 A:middle
part of JSON file.

00:33:16.196 --> 00:33:17.626 A:middle
Let's go ahead, use those JSON

00:33:17.626 --> 00:33:19.096 A:middle
files and create ResearchKit

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:19.806 A:middle
graphs on them.

00:33:21.136 --> 00:33:22.456 A:middle
I'll move over to my graph view

00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:24.896 A:middle
controller, and here, as you can

00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:26.186 A:middle
see, I have a create graph

00:33:26.186 --> 00:33:27.696 A:middle
method, which reads the JSON

00:33:27.696 --> 00:33:29.136 A:middle
files and creates ResearchKit

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:29.756 A:middle
graphs from them.

00:33:30.326 --> 00:33:31.506 A:middle
Let's call these methods in our

00:33:31.506 --> 00:33:32.666 A:middle
view data log.

00:33:34.116 --> 00:33:36.886 A:middle
Perfect. Now, let's run this.

00:33:37.456 --> 00:33:40.126 A:middle
As you can see, we added this

00:33:40.126 --> 00:33:41.256 A:middle
speech recognition Active Task,

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.736 A:middle
and added the movement disorder

00:33:43.736 --> 00:33:44.016 A:middle
API.

00:33:44.946 --> 00:33:45.936 A:middle
Here's what our Parkinson's

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:46.666 A:middle
study app looks like.

00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:47.996 A:middle
We have the questionnaire on

00:33:47.996 --> 00:33:48.206 A:middle
top.

00:33:48.686 --> 00:33:49.726 A:middle
Let's quickly go ahead and run

00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:50.336 A:middle
through one questionnaire.

00:33:51.816 --> 00:33:53.156 A:middle
As Srinath mentioned earlier, we

00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:54.606 A:middle
now have a card view for all

00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:55.476 A:middle
these survey items.

00:33:56.066 --> 00:33:57.536 A:middle
And also, all these steps in

00:33:57.536 --> 00:34:00.166 A:middle
ResearchKit adhere to the iOS
