00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:01.426 A:middle
added an ORK ordered task of

00:32:01.426 --> 00:32:02.386 A:middle
type speech recognition.

00:32:02.956 --> 00:32:05.106 A:middle
And if you notice, one of the

00:32:05.106 --> 00:32:06.166 A:middle
parameters is the speech

00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:07.916 A:middle
recognizer locale, which is an

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:09.586 A:middle
item provided by ResearchKit

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:12.076 A:middle
that represent all the locales

00:32:12.136 --> 00:32:13.306 A:middle
that are supported by speech

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:15.206 A:middle
recognition API, so that you, as

00:32:15.206 --> 00:32:16.566 A:middle
developers don't have to worry

00:32:16.566 --> 00:32:18.376 A:middle
about conforming if your locale

00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:19.476 A:middle
is supported by these speech

00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:20.096 A:middle
recognition API.

00:32:21.436 --> 00:32:22.776 A:middle
Now, let's move on to our

00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:23.486 A:middle
assessment manager.

00:32:23.996 --> 00:32:26.816 A:middle
As Gabriel mentioned, we have a

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:28.186 A:middle
variable call manager, which is

00:32:28.186 --> 00:32:29.456 A:middle
of type see and movement

00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:30.396 A:middle
disorder manager.

00:32:30.966 --> 00:32:32.436 A:middle
And if you notice, we have a

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:33.526 A:middle
function that calls the

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.266 A:middle
monitorKinesias method for the

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:36.716 A:middle
maximum duration of seven days.

00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:38.536 A:middle
Let's call this matter in our

00:32:38.536 --> 00:32:39.156 A:middle
initializer.

00:32:40.736 --> 00:32:43.026 A:middle
Now, whoever creates an object

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:45.346 A:middle
of a type assessment manager

00:32:45.716 --> 00:32:47.076 A:middle
will simply start the tremor and

00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:48.086 A:middle
dyskinesia symptom query.

00:32:49.096 --> 00:32:50.056 A:middle
Once we have collected these

00:32:50.056 --> 00:32:51.586 A:middle
data, we need a way to query

00:32:51.586 --> 00:32:52.476 A:middle
these data points also.

00:32:52.826 --> 00:32:53.976 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and add a

00:32:53.976 --> 00:32:55.476 A:middle
method that record these data.

00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:57.966 A:middle
I add a new, query new

00:32:57.966 --> 00:32:59.896 A:middle
assessments method, where I'm

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.126 A:middle
calling the query tremor method
