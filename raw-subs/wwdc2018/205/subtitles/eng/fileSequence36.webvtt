00:35:59.976 --> 00:36:01.936 A:middle
schedule so that way you'll be

00:36:01.936 --> 00:36:03.336 A:middle
able to leverage some of our

00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:05.156 A:middle
in-house features like

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:09.336 A:middle
accessibility, localization and

00:36:09.336 --> 00:36:09.836 A:middle
QA.

00:36:10.886 --> 00:36:12.976 A:middle
And on that note, as we continue

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:15.136 A:middle
to expand on our library of

00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:17.166 A:middle
Active Tasks, we look to all of

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:19.266 A:middle
our developers, researchers and

00:36:19.266 --> 00:36:21.226 A:middle
health professionals to help us

00:36:21.276 --> 00:36:22.366 A:middle
improve on these.

00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.106 A:middle
These Active Tasks are just

00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:25.926 A:middle
building blocks, which we hope

00:36:25.926 --> 00:36:28.226 A:middle
you can utilize to create much

00:36:28.226 --> 00:36:30.066 A:middle
bigger research studies, care

00:36:30.066 --> 00:36:31.916 A:middle
plans and treatment mechanisms.

00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:34.706 A:middle
And as you do, we encourage you

00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:35.956 A:middle
to contribute back to

00:36:35.956 --> 00:36:38.146 A:middle
ResearchKit, so we can continue

00:36:38.146 --> 00:36:40.396 A:middle
to improve our foundation and

00:36:40.396 --> 00:36:42.066 A:middle
expand on the breadth of Active

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:43.676 A:middle
Task that's available for

00:36:43.816 --> 00:36:45.626 A:middle
everyone to use.

00:36:46.256 --> 00:36:47.866 A:middle
