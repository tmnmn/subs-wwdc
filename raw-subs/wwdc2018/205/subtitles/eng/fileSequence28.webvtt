00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:00.446 A:middle
Let's take a look at what the

00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:01.476 A:middle
query function looks like.

00:28:01.896 --> 00:28:05.596 A:middle
As you can see, in this line,

00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.566 A:middle
recording for any new tremor

00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:09.056 A:middle
records that were stored on the

00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.896 A:middle
device since our last query

00:28:11.086 --> 00:28:11.306 A:middle
date.

00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:14.956 A:middle
These records are stored on

00:28:14.956 --> 00:28:17.736 A:middle
device by the API, but they also

00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:19.426 A:middle
will expire after seven days.

00:28:20.036 --> 00:28:21.656 A:middle
And so, before it expires,

00:28:21.916 --> 00:28:22.826 A:middle
you're going to want to take

00:28:22.986 --> 00:28:24.596 A:middle
ownership of those records

00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.486 A:middle
either by serializing them and

00:28:27.486 --> 00:28:28.756 A:middle
storing them on this device

00:28:28.756 --> 00:28:30.586 A:middle
yourself, or transferring it to

00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:32.046 A:middle
a different platform so you can

00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:33.206 A:middle
visualize it and analyze it.

00:28:34.436 --> 00:28:35.846 A:middle
The data will be returned to you

00:28:35.846 --> 00:28:37.626 A:middle
as an array of minute long

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:38.786 A:middle
object results.

00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:42.006 A:middle
So, one hour's worth of data, 60

00:28:42.176 --> 00:28:43.236 A:middle
result objects.

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:45.256 A:middle
Let's take a look at what one of

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.406 A:middle
those result objects will look

00:28:46.406 --> 00:28:46.556 A:middle
like.

00:28:52.186 --> 00:28:53.706 A:middle
As you can see, the result

00:28:53.706 --> 00:28:55.656 A:middle
objects return the percentage of

00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:57.096 A:middle
the time the percentage of that

00:28:57.096 --> 00:28:58.686 A:middle
one minute that the algorithm

00:28:58.686 --> 00:29:00.006 A:middle
was able to observe the
