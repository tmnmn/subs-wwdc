00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:00.636 A:middle
The first one, is a pre-stimulus

00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:01.746 A:middle
delay, which is a

00:13:01.746 --> 00:13:03.706 A:middle
developer-specified maximum

00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.876 A:middle
number in seconds that we use to

00:13:05.876 --> 00:13:08.086 A:middle
generate a random delay between

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:09.976 A:middle
one and that value before we

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:11.126 A:middle
start playing the tone to the

00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:11.616 A:middle
user.

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:13.876 A:middle
This is to ensure that the user

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.556 A:middle
cannot cheat the test by just

00:13:15.556 --> 00:13:18.446 A:middle
randomly tapping on the button.

00:13:18.596 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
Next, we are also providing a

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:22.176 A:middle
property for tone duration,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.406 A:middle
which governs the actual

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:24.786 A:middle
duration for which the tone will

00:13:24.786 --> 00:13:25.416 A:middle
be played.

00:13:26.216 --> 00:13:28.026 A:middle
And finally, is the post

00:13:28.026 --> 00:13:29.286 A:middle
stimulus delay, which is the

00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:31.136 A:middle
amount of time allocated to the

00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:33.226 A:middle
user to respond for that

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.186 A:middle
specific tone.

00:13:35.136 --> 00:13:36.696 A:middle
To incorporate this in your app,

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.266 A:middle
you create an instance of

00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:42.016 A:middle
ORKdBHL tone audiometry step

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:44.226 A:middle
with a unique identifier and

00:13:44.226 --> 00:13:45.796 A:middle
provide us values for some of

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:47.506 A:middle
the parameters, including a

00:13:47.506 --> 00:13:49.216 A:middle
frequency list, which is an

00:13:49.216 --> 00:13:51.326 A:middle
array of frequency that you wish

00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:52.776 A:middle
to be played back to your user.

00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:54.766 A:middle
We're also exposing more

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:56.166 A:middle
properties that you can further

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:58.146 A:middle
customize for your specific use

00:13:58.146 --> 00:13:58.626 A:middle
case.

00:13:59.086 --> 00:14:01.886 A:middle
Now, when the user completes
