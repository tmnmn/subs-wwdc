00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:01.806 A:middle
of the day, you and all of us

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:04.216 A:middle
can help improve and advance two

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.766 A:middle
core areas of interest, research

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:07.656 A:middle
and care.

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:10.716 A:middle
This year, I'm really excited to

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:12.566 A:middle
be talking to you about some of

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:13.906 A:middle
these topics which we care so

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:16.016 A:middle
deeply about in a variety of

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:16.346 A:middle
ways.

00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:18.376 A:middle
Starting with the framework

00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:20.016 A:middle
focus, where I'll talk to you

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.576 A:middle
about updates we have made to

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
our ResearchKit framework.

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:25.116 A:middle
From there, we'll move on to a

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:27.106 A:middle
more condition focused approach,

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.386 A:middle
specifically around movement

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:30.956 A:middle
disorders like Parkinson's,

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:33.016 A:middle
where Gabriel will come on stage

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:34.556 A:middle
and talk to you about this

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:35.486 A:middle
brand-new API.

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.286 A:middle
And finally, we'll bring it all

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:39.896 A:middle
together with a demo where we

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.746 A:middle
will showcase how you can

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:43.476 A:middle
utilize these new APIs and

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:45.476 A:middle
features directly in code.

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:48.466 A:middle
Now let's get started with

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:49.086 A:middle
ResearchKit.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.896 A:middle
Over the past year, we have been

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.856 A:middle
putting in a lot of effort to

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.546 A:middle
improve out openness and

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:57.196 A:middle
engagement with our community.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
Some updates to our ResearchKit
