00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.376 A:middle
features like localization,

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:03.386 A:middle
accessibility, and QA, which is

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.456 A:middle
why this year we will be pushing

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:07.366 A:middle
to stable two to three months

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:09.026 A:middle
after our push to master.

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:11.436 A:middle
We hope that you can use this

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.486 A:middle
time to check out our latest

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.926 A:middle
updates, provide feedback and

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.926 A:middle
submit PRs.

00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:18.976 A:middle
And the changes that you make,

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.906 A:middle
will make it soon into our

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:24.126 A:middle
stable, tagged release branch as

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:25.656 A:middle
opposed to you having to wait

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.646 A:middle
for an entire release cycle.

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:30.126 A:middle
And now that we have touched

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:31.806 A:middle
upon community updates, I would

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.886 A:middle
like to dive a little bit deeper

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:35.436 A:middle
and talk about updates we have

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:36.896 A:middle
made to the ResearchKit

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.846 A:middle
framework itself, starting with

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:40.436 A:middle
UI updates.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.986 A:middle
Now, for comparison, this is

00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:45.796 A:middle
what our Mini Form step looks

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.716 A:middle
like in ResearchKit 1.5, as

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.596 A:middle
taken from our ORK test app.

00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:53.376 A:middle
And here is the same Mini Form

00:05:53.376 --> 00:05:56.176 A:middle
step as it will be available in

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.386 A:middle
ResearchKit 2.0.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.636 A:middle
As you can see, we have worked
