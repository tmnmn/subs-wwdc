00:13:59.086 --> 00:14:01.886 A:middle
Now, when the user completes

00:14:01.886 --> 00:14:03.106 A:middle
this task as part of the

00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:05.166 A:middle
delegate call-back, the ORK

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:06.636 A:middle
result object will be returned

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:06.966 A:middle
to you.

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:08.906 A:middle
Let's take a look at what that

00:14:08.906 --> 00:14:10.306 A:middle
object looks like for this

00:14:10.306 --> 00:14:11.926 A:middle
particular task.

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:13.386 A:middle
So, at the top level you get a

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:14.726 A:middle
variety of information that

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:16.086 A:middle
includes things like output

00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:18.326 A:middle
volume, and also includes an

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:19.916 A:middle
array of sample objects.

00:14:20.436 --> 00:14:22.036 A:middle
These objects in turn

00:14:22.076 --> 00:14:23.416 A:middle
encapsulate things like

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.946 A:middle
channels, which refers to

00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:26.366 A:middle
whether the tone was being

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.766 A:middle
played in the left or right

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.956 A:middle
channel to the user, as well as

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:31.166 A:middle
the threshold value, as

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:31.936 A:middle
determined by the

00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:33.176 A:middle
Hughson-Westlake Method.

00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:35.466 A:middle
This also consists of an array

00:14:35.466 --> 00:14:36.666 A:middle
of unit objects.

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:38.936 A:middle
And the unit objects in turn,

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:40.886 A:middle
provide details like the dBHl

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:42.916 A:middle
value at which that particular

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:44.426 A:middle
tone was being played, and a

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.006 A:middle
variety of timestamps, which

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:48.576 A:middle
also includes when exactly did

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:49.886 A:middle
the user tap the button.

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:52.996 A:middle
So, now let's move on to our

00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:54.686 A:middle
next task that falls under the

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.716 A:middle
hearing category.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.686 A:middle
We are adding an environment SPL

00:14:58.686 --> 00:14:59.166 A:middle
meter.
