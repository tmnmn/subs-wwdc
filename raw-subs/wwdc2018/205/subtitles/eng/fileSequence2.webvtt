00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.126 A:middle
The app leverages care plans,

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.156 A:middle
healthcare data and other

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.836 A:middle
interactive components to help

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:07.806 A:middle
patients go through their weight

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:08.526 A:middle
loss journey.

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:11.906 A:middle
Data is constantly being synced

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:14.176 A:middle
between the iOS apps used by the

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:16.686 A:middle
patients, and the iPad apps used

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
by care providers in order to

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.626 A:middle
closely monitor and interact

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:22.136 A:middle
with their patients in real

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:22.606 A:middle
time.

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.086 A:middle
The team has received extremely

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:26.656 A:middle
positive feedback from both

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.876 A:middle
patients as well as clinicians

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.986 A:middle
with regards to the impact that

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:32.776 A:middle
these apps have had on their

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:33.986 A:middle
bariatric program.

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:36.326 A:middle
And now that we have touched

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:37.676 A:middle
upon where we have come since

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:39.866 A:middle
last year, I would like to take

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:42.376 A:middle
a quick step-out to all of our

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:43.626 A:middle
health frameworks as a whole.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.086 A:middle
The creation of these frameworks

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.766 A:middle
stems from our overarching

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.526 A:middle
desire to improve the world of

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:51.196 A:middle
health, through technology.

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:53.506 A:middle
And in that process, we really

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.526 A:middle
want to empower our users and

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:57.496 A:middle
provide more tools to developers

00:02:57.566 --> 00:02:59.356 A:middle
and researchers, so at the end

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:01.806 A:middle
of the day, you and all of us
