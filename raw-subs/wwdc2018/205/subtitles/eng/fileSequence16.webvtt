00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.606 A:middle
recognition module, which

00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:02.166 A:middle
leverages the speech recognition

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:04.586 A:middle
framework on iOS, now, this

00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.846 A:middle
gives us direct access to a

00:16:06.846 --> 00:16:08.486 A:middle
real-time speech recognizers

00:16:08.486 --> 00:16:10.056 A:middle
that supports over 50 different

00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:11.326 A:middle
languages, or locales.

00:16:11.726 --> 00:16:14.066 A:middle
As part of this task, the user

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:15.836 A:middle
is asked to either repeat a

00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.456 A:middle
sentence, or describe an image.

00:16:19.236 --> 00:16:20.996 A:middle
And once they are done speaking,

00:16:21.366 --> 00:16:23.266 A:middle
the users will be automatically

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:25.846 A:middle
taken to a next step, where they

00:16:25.846 --> 00:16:27.566 A:middle
can edit the generated

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:28.216 A:middle
transcript.

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:30.436 A:middle
So, for example in this case

00:16:30.676 --> 00:16:32.336 A:middle
quick and fox were incorrectly

00:16:32.336 --> 00:16:34.036 A:middle
interpreted as quite and box.

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.506 A:middle
Your users can just tap on these

00:16:36.506 --> 00:16:38.916 A:middle
words an edit them if necessary.

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:41.466 A:middle
Now, it's important to note,

00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:42.906 A:middle
that as part of this task, we

00:16:42.906 --> 00:16:45.046 A:middle
are returning to you a very,

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.986 A:middle
very rich dataset that consists

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:48.006 A:middle
of three main things.

00:16:48.736 --> 00:16:50.806 A:middle
A direct audio recording to what

00:16:50.806 --> 00:16:53.286 A:middle
the user said, the transcription

00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:54.236 A:middle
generated by the speech

00:16:54.236 --> 00:16:56.586 A:middle
recognition engine, and the

00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:58.586 A:middle
edited transcript by the user.

00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:01.656 A:middle
