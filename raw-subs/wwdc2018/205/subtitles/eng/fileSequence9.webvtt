00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:02.036 A:middle
step, the developer receives a

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:03.876 A:middle
delegate call back with an ORK

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:04.936 A:middle
resolved object.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.786 A:middle
Now, this object consists of a

00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:08.196 A:middle
variety of data points, which

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.686 A:middle
include things like user

00:09:09.686 --> 00:09:11.896 A:middle
responses, timing information

00:09:12.056 --> 00:09:13.856 A:middle
and data recorded from different

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:15.846 A:middle
sources like Accelerometer,

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.066 A:middle
Gyroscope, healthcare data, and

00:09:18.066 --> 00:09:19.226 A:middle
even from your microphone.

00:09:20.216 --> 00:09:21.926 A:middle
And this year, we are also

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:23.436 A:middle
adding support for health

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:23.926 A:middle
records.

00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:26.416 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at how

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.876 A:middle
you can utilize this in your

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:28.136 A:middle
app.

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:30.436 A:middle
Now, your objective here is to

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.546 A:middle
create a recorder configuration

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:34.556 A:middle
that can query health clinical

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:35.326 A:middle
data types.

00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:37.066 A:middle
And you need to provide us with

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:38.426 A:middle
two important parameters.

00:09:38.756 --> 00:09:41.706 A:middle
First is of HKClinicalType, and

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.866 A:middle
a second is an optional of type

00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:45.536 A:middle
HKFIRResourceType.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.746 A:middle
And once you have created this

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:49.406 A:middle
record of configuration, you

00:09:49.406 --> 00:09:50.486 A:middle
attach it to the step.

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:53.446 A:middle
So, now when the user is about

00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:55.106 A:middle
to perform the task, they will

00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:57.286 A:middle
be prompted with HealthKits new

00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:58.336 A:middle
authorization UI.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:00.986 A:middle
And only if they grant access
