00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
Some updates to our ResearchKit

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.956 A:middle
UI and modules, as well as some

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:05.356 A:middle
new additions to our existing

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.046 A:middle
library of Active Tasks.

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:09.456 A:middle
Now, let's get started with

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:10.656 A:middle
community updates.

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:12.966 A:middle
I want to cover two main topics,

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.106 A:middle
repository privileges and

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:16.156 A:middle
schedule updates.

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.526 A:middle
Over the past few months, we

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.505 A:middle
have been expanding our access

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.026 A:middle
rights and providing write

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.586 A:middle
privileges to members of our

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:24.216 A:middle
community.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.756 A:middle
In fact, we've chosen five

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.756 A:middle
all-star contributors and given

00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:30.146 A:middle
them direct access to the

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:32.206 A:middle
ResearchKit repository that also

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:34.326 A:middle
allows them to merge MPRs.

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:36.416 A:middle
A huge thank you and

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:38.466 A:middle
congratulations to Erin,

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:41.286 A:middle
Fernando, Nino, Ricardo, and

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:41.936 A:middle
Shannon.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.286 A:middle
Next, I want to touch on our

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.436 A:middle
schedule updates.

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:48.726 A:middle
Historically, we've been pushing

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.126 A:middle
to master and stable at the same

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:51.566 A:middle
time.

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:53.696 A:middle
Now, we realize that this

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:55.116 A:middle
inhibits the ability for

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:56.976 A:middle
developers, like you, to

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.656 A:middle
leverage some of our in-house

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.376 A:middle
features like localization,
