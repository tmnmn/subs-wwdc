[ Applause ]

00:30:03.586 --> 00:30:04.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:30:04.476 --> 00:30:05.786 A:middle
And welcome to the Advances in

00:30:05.786 --> 00:30:06.746 A:middle
Research in Care demo.

00:30:07.356 --> 00:30:08.936 A:middle
In this demo, we'll see some

00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:10.546 A:middle
research get update and also

00:30:10.546 --> 00:30:11.796 A:middle
implement the movement disorder

00:30:11.796 --> 00:30:12.076 A:middle
API.

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:14.096 A:middle
As part of our research kit

00:30:14.096 --> 00:30:15.486 A:middle
repository on GitHub, we have

00:30:15.486 --> 00:30:17.276 A:middle
already added an ORK Parkinson's

00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:17.746 A:middle
study app.

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:20.006 A:middle
This app implements the movement

00:30:20.006 --> 00:30:22.836 A:middle
disorder API and also visualizes

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:24.866 A:middle
the tremor and dyskinesia

00:30:24.866 --> 00:30:26.036 A:middle
symptom data points that we just

00:30:26.036 --> 00:30:26.176 A:middle
saw.

00:30:26.176 --> 00:30:27.796 A:middle
Let's go ahead and see what this

00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:28.526 A:middle
app looks like right now.

00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:38.846 A:middle
We have an Apple Watch app where

00:30:38.846 --> 00:30:39.916 A:middle
we implement the movement

00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:41.866 A:middle
disorder API, collect the tremor

00:30:41.866 --> 00:30:42.936 A:middle
and dyskinesia symptom data

00:30:42.936 --> 00:30:44.276 A:middle
points and send them to our

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:44.656 A:middle
phone app.

00:30:45.346 --> 00:30:46.646 A:middle
In our iPhone app, we have a

00:30:46.646 --> 00:30:48.146 A:middle
questionnaire, a few Active

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:50.356 A:middle
Tasks, and also visualize these

00:30:50.356 --> 00:30:51.386 A:middle
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:51.906 A:middle
data points.

00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:53.926 A:middle
Let's look at what the code

00:30:53.926 --> 00:30:55.316 A:middle
looks like, and for this demo,

00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:56.846 A:middle
we'll start with the basic bald

00:30:56.846 --> 00:30:58.126 A:middle
plate application and try to

00:30:58.126 --> 00:30:58.826 A:middle
recreate this app.
