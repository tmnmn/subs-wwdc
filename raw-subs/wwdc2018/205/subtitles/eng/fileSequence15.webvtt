00:15:00.196 --> 00:15:02.256 A:middle
This implements an A-weighted

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:04.316 A:middle
filter, in order to measure the

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:05.596 A:middle
environmental sound pressure

00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:08.726 A:middle
level in DBA, or in other words,

00:15:08.986 --> 00:15:10.276 A:middle
it tells you how noisy it is.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:13.226 A:middle
Now, this step also accepts a

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:15.576 A:middle
threshold value, and this makes

00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:17.506 A:middle
things interesting, because now

00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:19.896 A:middle
you can use the step as a gating

00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:20.286 A:middle
step.

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.196 A:middle
So, for example, if you want

00:15:22.196 --> 00:15:23.846 A:middle
your users to perform the tone

00:15:23.846 --> 00:15:25.906 A:middle
audiometry task, you can add

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.956 A:middle
this task before that to ensure

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:30.086 A:middle
that your users are not in an

00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:31.896 A:middle
environment that is too noisy to

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:36.296 A:middle
accurately perform the task.

00:15:36.446 --> 00:15:37.946 A:middle
To add this you create an

00:15:37.946 --> 00:15:39.606 A:middle
instance of ORK environment,

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.226 A:middle
SPLMeterStep with a unique

00:15:41.226 --> 00:15:43.096 A:middle
identifier and provide us the

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:43.966 A:middle
threshold value.

00:15:44.826 --> 00:15:46.386 A:middle
We're also exposing additional

00:15:46.386 --> 00:15:47.656 A:middle
properties that you can further

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:48.336 A:middle
customize.

00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:51.486 A:middle
And now, let's take a quick

00:15:51.486 --> 00:15:53.696 A:middle
detour and move on to our next

00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:55.906 A:middle
category, speech.

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:58.596 A:middle
We're adding a speech

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.606 A:middle
recognition module, which
