00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:01.656 A:middle
To add this to your app, you

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:03.376 A:middle
create an instance of ORK

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:05.056 A:middle
speechRecognitionStep, and

00:17:05.056 --> 00:17:06.596 A:middle
provide us with either a UI

00:17:06.596 --> 00:17:07.915 A:middle
image, or a string.

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:10.386 A:middle
You can also customize the

00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:12.286 A:middle
locale for this recognition.

00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:14.266 A:middle
And also, you can surface

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.316 A:middle
real-time transcription as the

00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:17.326 A:middle
user is speaking.

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:20.695 A:middle
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:22.746 A:middle
one of the subsets of our result

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:23.326 A:middle
object.

00:17:24.536 --> 00:17:26.816 A:middle
This is of type FS transcription

00:17:27.086 --> 00:17:28.306 A:middle
as surface by the speech

00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:29.406 A:middle
recognition framework.

00:17:29.896 --> 00:17:31.576 A:middle
The formattedString provides the

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:33.316 A:middle
transcript, and the array of

00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:35.276 A:middle
segment objects, essentially

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:37.006 A:middle
breakdown the transcript into

00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:39.186 A:middle
substrings, as well as provide a

00:17:39.256 --> 00:17:40.496 A:middle
confidence letter for each

00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:41.076 A:middle
substring.

00:17:41.636 --> 00:17:42.866 A:middle
On top of this, they also

00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:44.926 A:middle
provide an array of alternative

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:46.846 A:middle
string, as you can see here in

00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:48.146 A:middle
this illustrative example.

00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:51.536 A:middle
Now, these results can be used

00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:53.896 A:middle
to derive syntactic, semantic

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:55.986 A:middle
and linguistic features, as well

00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:58.146 A:middle
as speaking rate in order to

00:17:58.146 --> 00:18:00.446 A:middle
evaluate the speech patterns for
