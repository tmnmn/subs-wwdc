00:10:56.156 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
We are adding a new dBHL tone

00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:01.656 A:middle
audiometry step.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.846 A:middle
This implements the

00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:05.916 A:middle
Hughson-Westlake Method and

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.336 A:middle
allows you to determine the

00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:08.746 A:middle
hearing threshold level of a

00:11:08.746 --> 00:11:11.206 A:middle
user in the dBHL scale.

00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:14.256 A:middle
And to facilitate this, and

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:15.896 A:middle
ensure that you get the most

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:16.886 A:middle
accurate results.

00:11:17.246 --> 00:11:18.816 A:middle
I'm really excited to say that

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.826 A:middle
for the very first time we are

00:11:20.916 --> 00:11:22.886 A:middle
open sourcing calibration data

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:23.996 A:middle
for our AirPods.

00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:26.336 A:middle
Now, this comes with three

00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:26.866 A:middle
tables.

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:29.476 A:middle
The first one is a volume curve

00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:32.396 A:middle
for AirPods on all iOS devices.

00:11:32.866 --> 00:11:34.366 A:middle
The second one is the

00:11:34.366 --> 00:11:36.096 A:middle
sensitivity per frequency.

00:11:36.136 --> 00:11:38.266 A:middle
Where sensitivity is measured in

00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:39.656 A:middle
decibels sound pressure level.

00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:41.426 A:middle
And finally, we are also

00:11:41.426 --> 00:11:42.936 A:middle
providing the reference

00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:44.386 A:middle
equivalent threshold sound

00:11:44.386 --> 00:11:46.596 A:middle
pressure level tables or RETSPL.

00:11:46.596 --> 00:11:49.996 A:middle
Now, it's really important to

00:11:49.996 --> 00:11:52.796 A:middle
note that the RETSPL table is

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:53.606 A:middle
still in beta.

00:11:54.216 --> 00:11:56.066 A:middle
This means that we are actively

00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
running internal validations and

00:11:57.966 --> 00:11:58.466 A:middle
tests.

00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:00.086 A:middle
And over the next few weeks, we
