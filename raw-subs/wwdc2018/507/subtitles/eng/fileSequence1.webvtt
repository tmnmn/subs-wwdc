Streaming key delivery and

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:04.376 A:middle
answer a few frequently asked

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.146 A:middle
questions from developers, along

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:06.476 A:middle
the way.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.546 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:11.846 A:middle
FairPlay Streaming was

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:14.306 A:middle
introduced back in 2015 to help

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:16.416 A:middle
protect HLS streams delivered to

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:17.196 A:middle
our platforms.

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:20.026 A:middle
FairPlay Streaming specification

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:22.586 A:middle
specifies a set of steps an app

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:24.316 A:middle
needs to follow in order to

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.716 A:middle
securely deliver content

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:27.706 A:middle
decryption keys so the platform

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:29.476 A:middle
could decrypt and play back

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:30.596 A:middle
encrypted media.

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:33.806 A:middle
While delivering FairPlay

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:36.506 A:middle
Streaming keys your app works as

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.306 A:middle
a liaison between the platform

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:39.996 A:middle
and your key server.

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:43.096 A:middle
When it receives an on-demand

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:44.836 A:middle
key loading request from

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:46.886 A:middle
AVFoundation it, in turn,

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:48.976 A:middle
requests for an Encrypted Key

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.756 A:middle
Request, also known as SPC.

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:54.576 A:middle
The SPC is then sent to the key

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.996 A:middle
server, which responds back with

00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:00.496 A:middle
an Encrypted Key Response, also
