00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:03.986 A:middle
If you wish to enforce different

00:13:03.986 --> 00:13:05.306 A:middle
HDCP levels for different

00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:06.876 A:middle
radians, you should specify

00:13:06.876 --> 00:13:08.256 A:middle
different key identifiers for

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:09.106 A:middle
those radians.

00:13:09.426 --> 00:13:11.396 A:middle
And provide appropriate key

00:13:11.396 --> 00:13:12.836 A:middle
responses from your key server.

00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:17.576 A:middle
Lastly, you should be careful

00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:19.086 A:middle
while responding to key loading

00:13:19.086 --> 00:13:20.956 A:middle
requests with persistent keys

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:24.036 A:middle
because persistent keys are tied

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:24.966 A:middle
to the device they were

00:13:24.966 --> 00:13:25.836 A:middle
generated on.

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:28.966 A:middle
For example, you should not use

00:13:29.186 --> 00:13:30.606 A:middle
a persistent key to respond to a

00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:32.546 A:middle
key loading request from an

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.366 A:middle
AirPlay session.

00:13:34.866 --> 00:13:36.426 A:middle
Doing so will result in playback

00:13:36.426 --> 00:13:36.886 A:middle
failure.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:41.406 A:middle
We made some API changes in iOS

00:13:41.406 --> 00:13:44.126 A:middle
11.2 to help you avoid and catch

00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:45.956 A:middle
such issues sooner, rather than

00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:46.346 A:middle
later.

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.316 A:middle
Let me walk you through some

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:49.616 A:middle
code snippets to explain.

00:13:52.196 --> 00:13:53.076 A:middle
If you are using

00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:54.406 A:middle
AVContentKeySession to deliver

00:13:54.406 --> 00:13:56.926 A:middle
keys, now you won't even be able

00:13:56.926 --> 00:13:58.856 A:middle
to RequestPersistableContentKey

00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:00.636 A:middle
request object if the
