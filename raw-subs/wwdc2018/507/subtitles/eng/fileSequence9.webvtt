00:08:58.466 --> 00:09:00.346 A:middle
Streaming feature that allows

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:02.646 A:middle
you to specify two expiration

00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:04.566 A:middle
durations on persistent keys;

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:07.126 A:middle
storage and playback duration.

00:09:08.956 --> 00:09:11.046 A:middle
Storage duration specifies for

00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:13.196 A:middle
how long you wish the key to be

00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:15.336 A:middle
valid while it is sitting in

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:16.006 A:middle
your storage.

00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:18.446 A:middle
That is, before being used for

00:09:18.446 --> 00:09:19.016 A:middle
playback.

00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:22.686 A:middle
It is, typically, large, like 30

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:23.076 A:middle
days.

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:25.966 A:middle
Playback duration, on the other

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:28.896 A:middle
hand, specifies how long you

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:31.176 A:middle
with the key to be valid after

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.346 A:middle
it was used for playback.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.216 A:middle
It is, typically, shorter than

00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:35.116 A:middle
storage duration.

00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:36.786 A:middle
For example, 24 hours.

00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:40.396 A:middle
This feature allows you to

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:42.006 A:middle
specify such expiration

00:09:42.006 --> 00:09:43.826 A:middle
durations when you create

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:45.946 A:middle
persistent keys and the platform

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:47.406 A:middle
ensures that the two expiration

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:49.556 A:middle
durations are enforced, even

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:50.706 A:middle
when the device is offline.

00:09:51.936 --> 00:09:53.806 A:middle
So, you might be wondering how

00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:55.396 A:middle
and where can you specify these

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:56.716 A:middle
two expiration durations.

00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:00.396 A:middle
FairPlay introduced a new TLLV
