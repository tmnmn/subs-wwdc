00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:00.626 A:middle
Another option is to include all

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:02.566 A:middle
key identifiers in the master

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:05.106 A:middle
playlist as session keys while

00:07:05.106 --> 00:07:06.996 A:middle
authoring the content and use

00:07:06.996 --> 00:07:08.496 A:middle
preloads eligible content keys

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:09.746 A:middle
property on

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:10.676 A:middle
AVAssetResourceLoader.

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:14.206 A:middle
At this point I would like to

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:15.486 A:middle
point out that we have a

00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:17.446 A:middle
dedicated session about

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:19.006 A:middle
optimizing HLS performance in

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:20.506 A:middle
general, not just key delivery.

00:07:21.706 --> 00:07:24.816 A:middle
You should definitely check that

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:25.606 A:middle
out.

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:27.936 A:middle
Moving on from preloading,

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.956 A:middle
AVContentKeySession could also

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:31.916 A:middle
help you scale your live

00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:32.426 A:middle
offering.

00:07:33.176 --> 00:07:34.226 A:middle
Are you wondering how?

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:36.796 A:middle
Well, you could use

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:38.536 A:middle
AVContentKeySession to disperse

00:07:38.536 --> 00:07:40.386 A:middle
key loading requests from

00:07:40.386 --> 00:07:41.896 A:middle
clients that are streaming your

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:42.686 A:middle
live content.

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:46.346 A:middle
Typically, live streams rotate

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:49.026 A:middle
keys periodically in order to

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:50.516 A:middle
add an extra layer of protection

00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:51.456 A:middle
for the content.

00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:55.126 A:middle
It is easy to imagine that these

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:56.676 A:middle
keys appear at the exact same

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.616 A:middle
time when clients refresh live

00:07:58.616 --> 00:07:59.296 A:middle
playlists.

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.026 A:middle
When that happens, millions of
