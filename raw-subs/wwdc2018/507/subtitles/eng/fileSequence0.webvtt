00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:19.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and thanks for tuning

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:19.736 A:middle
in.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.486 A:middle
My name is Anil Katti and I'm an

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:24.216 A:middle
AVFoundation Engineer at Apple.

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:27.316 A:middle
Today, I'm going to present some

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.156 A:middle
best practices and recommended

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:30.886 A:middle
patterns for adopting

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:32.226 A:middle
AVContentKeySession API.

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:36.126 A:middle
AVContentKeySession is an

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:38.386 A:middle
AVFoundation API that enables

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:39.946 A:middle
delivery of FairPlay Streaming

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:41.836 A:middle
keys on Apple platforms.

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:45.366 A:middle
So, here's what I'll cover in

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:45.986 A:middle
the session.

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:47.876 A:middle
I'll start with an overview of

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:49.456 A:middle
FairPlay streaming and

00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:50.546 A:middle
AVContentKeySession.

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.856 A:middle
I'll then present some ways you

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:55.216 A:middle
can optimize playback using

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:56.206 A:middle
AVContentKeySession.

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.436 A:middle
I'll, also, cover some common

00:00:58.436 --> 00:00:59.936 A:middle
pitfalls around FairPlay

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:01.846 A:middle
