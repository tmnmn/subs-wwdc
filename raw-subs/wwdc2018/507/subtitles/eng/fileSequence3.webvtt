delivered on our platforms come

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:01.676 A:middle
through AVContentKeySession.

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.286 A:middle
The API has helped developers

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:06.856 A:middle
optimize key delivery in their

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:07.726 A:middle
applications.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:10.436 A:middle
I will present some ways you

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:11.876 A:middle
could get more out of the API.

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:14.206 A:middle
But before that, let's see what

00:03:14.206 --> 00:03:15.256 A:middle
makes AVContentKeySession

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:15.816 A:middle
different.

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:19.656 A:middle
With AVAssetResourceLoader

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:22.266 A:middle
applications could load keys

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.426 A:middle
only when AVFoundation requires

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:26.766 A:middle
one and sends an on-demand key

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:27.626 A:middle
loading request.

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:30.786 A:middle
This, typically, happens when

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:31.816 A:middle
AVFoundation downloads

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:33.506 A:middle
playlists, parses them, and then

00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:35.346 A:middle
finds out that the content is

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:36.736 A:middle
encrypted.

00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:38.206 A:middle
Further, AVFoundation could send

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:39.886 A:middle
these key loading requests at

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.306 A:middle
any point during playback.

00:03:41.926 --> 00:03:44.106 A:middle
For example, AVFoundation sends

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:45.996 A:middle
new key loading requests if it's

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:49.466 A:middle
switched to a radian that uses a

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:50.616 A:middle
different key in the middle of

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:51.306 A:middle
the playback.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:53.596 A:middle
AVContentKeySession,

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:55.056 A:middle
essentially, changes that model.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:03:58.086 A:middle
It decouples key loading from

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:00.026 A:middle
media loading or playback and
