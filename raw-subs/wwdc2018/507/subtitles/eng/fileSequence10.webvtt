00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:00.396 A:middle
FairPlay introduced a new TLLV

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:02.526 A:middle
called Offline Key TLLV for this

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:03.076 A:middle
purpose.

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:06.176 A:middle
This has to be signaled in the

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:07.386 A:middle
CKC that is used while

00:10:07.386 --> 00:10:08.936 A:middle
requesting persistent key.

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:14.026 A:middle
In terms of code, you generate a

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.216 A:middle
persistent key by calling this

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.286 A:middle
method on

00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:18.776 A:middle
AVPersistableContentKeyRequest

00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:19.196 A:middle
Object.

00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:22.126 A:middle
This returns a persistent key

00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:24.246 A:middle
data blob that you should save

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:26.666 A:middle
in your app storage and use it

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:28.256 A:middle
to answer future key loading

00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:29.406 A:middle
requests.

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:32.166 A:middle
Note that this key is valid

00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:33.776 A:middle
until the end of storage

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:35.306 A:middle
duration, 30 days from our

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:35.816 A:middle
example.

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:39.456 A:middle
So, when you use this key to

00:10:39.456 --> 00:10:41.046 A:middle
start the playback for the first

00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:43.486 A:middle
time you might receive an

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:46.316 A:middle
updated persistent key through a

00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:47.606 A:middle
new delegate callback.

00:10:49.476 --> 00:10:50.556 A:middle
When the delegate callback is

00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:52.446 A:middle
involved you should discard the

00:10:52.446 --> 00:10:54.696 A:middle
original persistent key and save

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.206 A:middle
this updated persistent key in

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:57.246 A:middle
your app storage.

00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.436 A:middle
You should use this to answer
