00:05:58.386 --> 00:06:00.656 A:middle
on-demand key loading request if

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:01.966 A:middle
the playback route changes, for

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:02.526 A:middle
instance.

00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:05.836 A:middle
Keep in mind that the user could

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:07.596 A:middle
decide to AirPlay the content to

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.356 A:middle
an Apple TV or plug in a

00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:11.856 A:middle
Lightning to Digital AV adapter.

00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:14.546 A:middle
And in these cases, we need new

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:16.016 A:middle
keys for decryption.

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.116 A:middle
So, the app should always be

00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:22.776 A:middle
prepared to answer on-demand key

00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:24.656 A:middle
loading requests, even when it

00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:25.606 A:middle
preloads keys.

00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:30.226 A:middle
Here's another frequently asked

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:31.386 A:middle
question around this topic.

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:33.776 A:middle
How could the app preload all

00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:36.206 A:middle
keys that might be required

00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:37.026 A:middle
during playback?

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:40.366 A:middle
Well, in order to preload a key,

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.046 A:middle
you need the corresponding key

00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:42.746 A:middle
identifier.

00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:45.266 A:middle
The one that's specified in

00:06:45.266 --> 00:06:46.766 A:middle
EXT-X-KEY tag in the HLS

00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
playlist.

00:06:49.236 --> 00:06:51.436 A:middle
We recommend that you obtain all

00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:54.286 A:middle
key identifiers and asset

00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:55.806 A:middle
[inaudible] from your server in

00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:56.846 A:middle
an out-of-band fashion.

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:00.626 A:middle
Another option is to include all
