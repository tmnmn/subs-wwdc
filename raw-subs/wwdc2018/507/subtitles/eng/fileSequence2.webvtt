00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:00.496 A:middle
an Encrypted Key Response, also

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:01.996 A:middle
known as CKC.

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:05.046 A:middle
Finally, the app provided CKC

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:07.426 A:middle
back to AVFoundation so it could

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.726 A:middle
start decryption and playback.

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:13.886 A:middle
Until recently, apps used the

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.136 A:middle
generic AVFoundation API called

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.036 A:middle
AVAssetResourceLoader to deliver

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:19.166 A:middle
content decryption keys.

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:23.126 A:middle
But last year we introduced the

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:25.336 A:middle
new AVFoundation Class called

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:27.036 A:middle
AVContentKeySession that was

00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:28.436 A:middle
designed specifically around

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:29.586 A:middle
content decryption keys.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.836 A:middle
We had two goals in mind for

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:35.036 A:middle
AVContentKeySession.

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
One, to simplify key loading

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.356 A:middle
process and provide applications

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:42.086 A:middle
better control over the life

00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:43.226 A:middle
cycle of content decryption

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:43.686 A:middle
keys.

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:47.406 A:middle
And two, serve as a home for new

00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:48.866 A:middle
content protection features.

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:53.006 A:middle
AVContentKeySession adoption has

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.196 A:middle
been great, so far.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:56.266 A:middle
And already, a majority of

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:57.546 A:middle
FairPlay Streaming keys

00:02:58.016 --> 00:03:00.336 A:middle
delivered on our platforms come
