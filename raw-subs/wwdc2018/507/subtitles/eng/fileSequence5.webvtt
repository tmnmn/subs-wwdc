00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.156 A:middle
different radians, you could

00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:03.256 A:middle
batch up all key requests before

00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:04.756 A:middle
even talking to your key server.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.036 A:middle
This reduces some load on the

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.126 A:middle
key server, and also, eliminates

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:11.556 A:middle
round trips for each keys.

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:16.136 A:middle
You could initiate key loading

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:17.166 A:middle
process by calling

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.786 A:middle
processContentKeyRequest method

00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:20.796 A:middle
on an AVContentKeySession

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:21.356 A:middle
instance.

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.126 A:middle
Once you call this method

00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:26.566 A:middle
AVContentKeySession will send

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:28.056 A:middle
you an AVContentKeyRequest

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:29.936 A:middle
object by invoking the delegate

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:30.436 A:middle
callback.

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:33.676 A:middle
AVContentKeySession allows you

00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:35.166 A:middle
to perform FairPlay Streaming

00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:37.676 A:middle
specific operations like request

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:39.736 A:middle
encrypted key requests and

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:41.306 A:middle
respond with encrypted key

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:41.886 A:middle
response.

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:46.706 A:middle
Okay. So, now let's say you have

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:47.826 A:middle
successfully preloaded a

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:48.626 A:middle
particular key.

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:51.006 A:middle
Is it possible that the key is

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.316 A:middle
requested again after the

00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:53.256 A:middle
playback starts?

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:55.436 A:middle
Yes, that's possible.

00:05:56.326 --> 00:05:58.386 A:middle
The app could receive an

00:05:58.386 --> 00:06:00.656 A:middle
on-demand key loading request if
