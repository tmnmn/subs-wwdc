functionality, and what kind of

00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:02.936 A:middle
features and content won't be

00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:04.336 A:middle
available anymore after the

00:29:04.336 --> 00:29:06.246 A:middle
trial if they decide not to

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:06.776 A:middle
continue.

00:29:10.276 --> 00:29:10.576 A:middle
All right.

00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:12.136 A:middle
So we talked about a number of

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.136 A:middle
new features today.

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:14.906 A:middle
So let's take a second to recap

00:29:14.976 --> 00:29:15.156 A:middle
them.

00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.386 A:middle
First, we're launching an

00:29:17.386 --> 00:29:19.316 A:middle
all-new App Store Connect API

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:20.426 A:middle
this summer.

00:29:21.116 --> 00:29:24.336 A:middle
We're unifying where you go to

00:29:24.336 --> 00:29:25.336 A:middle
manage your users.

00:29:25.856 --> 00:29:30.126 A:middle
We've extended app Transporter

00:29:30.696 --> 00:29:32.696 A:middle
to support Linux.

00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:35.706 A:middle
We're launching TestFlight

00:29:35.706 --> 00:29:37.106 A:middle
public links, which will make it

00:29:37.106 --> 00:29:39.116 A:middle
a lot easier for you to invite

00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:40.396 A:middle
large numbers of testers.

00:29:41.786 --> 00:29:43.266 A:middle
We've launched a brand-new sales

00:29:43.266 --> 00:29:46.416 A:middle
and trends overview page, a new

00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:48.556 A:middle
App Store Connect for iOS page,

00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:50.936 A:middle
and a path for you to offer

00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:53.876 A:middle
trials to customers on your paid

00:29:53.876 --> 00:29:54.356 A:middle
apps.

00:29:54.776 --> 00:29:56.466 A:middle
Now these are features that will

00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:58.506 A:middle
be launching between now and the

00:29:58.506 --> 00:29:59.146 A:middle
end of the summer.

00:29:59.596 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
