00:26:58.766 --> 00:27:00.316 A:middle
So that's a beautiful new app

00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:02.336 A:middle
that'll give you even more power

00:27:02.646 --> 00:27:04.606 A:middle
to manage your apps on the go.

00:27:06.246 --> 00:27:08.536 A:middle
So next we'd like to talk about

00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:10.726 A:middle
a guideline change we made just

00:27:10.726 --> 00:27:13.236 A:middle
this week that will let those of

00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:15.556 A:middle
you with paid apps offer

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:18.306 A:middle
time-based free trials for your

00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:18.996 A:middle
customers.

00:27:19.586 --> 00:27:23.146 A:middle
Now those of you who are using

00:27:23.416 --> 00:27:24.906 A:middle
subscriptions today know that

00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:27.046 A:middle
free trials are a great way to

00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:28.496 A:middle
attract new customers to your

00:27:28.496 --> 00:27:29.226 A:middle
services.

00:27:29.436 --> 00:27:30.816 A:middle
But we also know that

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:33.546 A:middle
subscriptions aren't the model

00:27:33.546 --> 00:27:35.246 A:middle
that works for every app which

00:27:35.246 --> 00:27:37.166 A:middle
is why we're happy to now have a

00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:38.396 A:middle
path for paid apps.

00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:41.276 A:middle
So we're going to take a look at

00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:42.976 A:middle
what this setup looks like.

00:27:43.526 --> 00:27:45.726 A:middle
So let's say we start with a

00:27:45.726 --> 00:27:46.286 A:middle
paid app.

00:27:47.356 --> 00:27:48.906 A:middle
The first thing you would do is

00:27:48.906 --> 00:27:51.586 A:middle
turn your paid app into a free

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:51.876 A:middle
app.

00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:55.286 A:middle
Now on top of this free app,

00:27:55.476 --> 00:27:56.586 A:middle
you're going to add two

00:27:56.766 --> 00:27:58.856 A:middle
non-consumable in-app purchases.

00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:02.076 A:middle
The first is a free tier 0
