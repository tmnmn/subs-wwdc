you much more information about

00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:04.876 A:middle
that user including what their

permissions will look like going

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:07.066 A:middle
forward.

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:09.966 A:middle

00:07:11.706 --> 00:07:12.946 A:middle
look at each and every one of

your users and make any

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:16.726 A:middle

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.276 A:middle

And once this process completes,

00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:22.466 A:middle
we encourage you to come back

00:07:22.846 --> 00:07:24.296 A:middle
one last time to make sure your

users are in a state that makes

00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:28.746 A:middle
sense to you and after that you

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:30.426 A:middle
simply come back to App Store

00:07:30.426 --> 00:07:33.136 A:middle
Connect for any future changes.

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:35.876 A:middle

user management, others were

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.796 A:middle

course, spinning up builds.

00:07:52.496 --> 00:07:54.186 A:middle
At some point, you reach a build

00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:55.526 A:middle
