00:17:04.986 --> 00:17:06.486 A:middle
You may just have released a

00:17:06.486 --> 00:17:08.776 A:middle
version of one of your apps, or

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:09.685 A:middle
you may just want to see how

00:17:14.516 --> 00:17:16.646 A:middle
And for that reason, we've

00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:18.236 A:middle
created a brand-new App Store

around giving you the ability to

00:17:24.536 --> 00:17:26.316 A:middle
access your apps data on the go

00:17:26.856 --> 00:17:29.006 A:middle
as well as empowering you to

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.256 A:middle
take certain quick actions and

00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:33.256 A:middle
letting you know exactly when

00:17:33.256 --> 00:17:33.886 A:middle
you can take them.

00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:36.576 A:middle
Now let's start with sales and

00:17:36.576 --> 00:17:36.946 A:middle
trends.

00:17:38.376 --> 00:17:39.766 A:middle

performance over the past 7

00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:44.636 A:middle
days.

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.556 A:middle
You'll see your app's units and

00:17:47.556 --> 00:17:48.146 A:middle
proceeds.

00:17:48.716 --> 00:17:50.576 A:middle
Scrolling down, you'll see

00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:53.866 A:middle
