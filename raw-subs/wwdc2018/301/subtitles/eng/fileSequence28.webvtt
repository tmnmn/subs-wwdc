00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:02.076 A:middle
The first is a free tier 0

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.276 A:middle
priced non-consumable.

00:28:04.756 --> 00:28:05.876 A:middle
And you'll present this to your

00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:07.066 A:middle
customers when they launch the

00:28:07.066 --> 00:28:10.076 A:middle
app so that they can opt-in to

00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:10.946 A:middle
the free trial.

00:28:11.616 --> 00:28:15.026 A:middle
Now the second non-consumable is

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:16.696 A:middle
the in-app purchase that you use

00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:18.796 A:middle
to unlock your app functionality

00:28:18.796 --> 00:28:20.626 A:middle
for that customer for good.

00:28:21.676 --> 00:28:23.136 A:middle
You can present this at any

00:28:23.136 --> 00:28:24.376 A:middle
point; in the beginning when

00:28:24.376 --> 00:28:26.256 A:middle
they launch the app or when

00:28:26.376 --> 00:28:27.956 A:middle
their free trial is complete.

00:28:28.646 --> 00:28:32.186 A:middle
Now in order to use this setup,

00:28:32.706 --> 00:28:34.816 A:middle
there are a few guidelines to

00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:35.976 A:middle
look out for and to follow.

00:28:36.386 --> 00:28:40.786 A:middle
First, make sure you name your

00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:43.356 A:middle
trial in-app purchase with this

00:28:43.356 --> 00:28:44.246 A:middle
naming convention.

00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:47.096 A:middle
And next, you'll want to make

00:28:47.096 --> 00:28:48.596 A:middle
sure that it's very clear to the

00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:49.956 A:middle
customer exactly what they are

00:28:49.956 --> 00:28:50.766 A:middle
signing up for.

00:28:51.456 --> 00:28:53.456 A:middle
So please make sure that they

00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:54.976 A:middle
know how long the free trial is

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:56.786 A:middle
going to last, how much it'll

00:28:56.786 --> 00:28:58.406 A:middle
cost to unlock the

00:28:58.406 --> 00:29:00.826 A:middle
functionality, and what kind of
