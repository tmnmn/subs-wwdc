00:29:59.596 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
But we also have two significant

00:30:01.926 --> 00:30:03.226 A:middle
features we launched over the

00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:04.896 A:middle
past year that we'd like to

00:30:04.896 --> 00:30:05.336 A:middle
highlight.

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:08.466 A:middle
And these are intro pricing and

00:30:08.466 --> 00:30:09.166 A:middle
pre-orders.

00:30:09.636 --> 00:30:13.796 A:middle
So introductory pricing, for

00:30:13.796 --> 00:30:14.656 A:middle
those of you who use

00:30:14.656 --> 00:30:17.246 A:middle
subscriptions, is a great way to

00:30:17.246 --> 00:30:18.946 A:middle
incentivize new customers to

00:30:18.946 --> 00:30:20.376 A:middle
sign up for your subscriptions.

00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:23.236 A:middle
Now you do this by offering your

00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:25.296 A:middle
customers a discounted

00:30:25.706 --> 00:30:27.546 A:middle
introductory price at the

00:30:27.546 --> 00:30:29.076 A:middle
beginning of your subscription.

00:30:29.346 --> 00:30:31.246 A:middle
There are three different

00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:32.456 A:middle
pricing models we offer for

00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:32.846 A:middle
this.

00:30:33.556 --> 00:30:35.576 A:middle
First, we have free trials.

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:38.106 A:middle
Now with free trials, your

00:30:38.106 --> 00:30:40.656 A:middle
customers sign up for free.

00:30:41.356 --> 00:30:43.016 A:middle
They use your services for the

00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:44.056 A:middle
introductory period.

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:45.816 A:middle
And at the end of the period,

00:30:46.056 --> 00:30:47.806 A:middle
they move on to your regular

00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:48.766 A:middle
subscription price.

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.566 A:middle
Next, we have a model that we

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:52.706 A:middle
call pay upfront.

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.616 A:middle
With this model, your customers

00:30:54.616 --> 00:30:56.416 A:middle
sign up and they pay one time at

00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:57.196 A:middle
the beginning of your

00:30:57.196 --> 00:30:58.096 A:middle
introductory period.

00:30:58.856 --> 00:30:59.796 A:middle
And, again, at the end of the

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.806 A:middle
period, the regular subscription
