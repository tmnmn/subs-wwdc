00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
diverse modernization strategies

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:01.546 A:middle
across your apps.

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:04.106 A:middle
Some of you have paid apps, free

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:05.046 A:middle
apps, apps with in-app

00:18:05.046 --> 00:18:06.846 A:middle
purchases, or you may leverage

00:18:06.846 --> 00:18:07.596 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.046 A:middle
Now we know that and we wanted

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:10.926 A:middle
to give you the ability to

00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:12.736 A:middle
select exactly which of these

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:14.976 A:middle
graphs are most relevant to you.

00:18:15.446 --> 00:18:17.576 A:middle
So we've added this edit

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:18.956 A:middle
function where you can select

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:20.276 A:middle
the graphs you'd like to see.

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:22.936 A:middle
So let's say that, in my

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.786 A:middle
business, I only have free apps.

00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:27.366 A:middle
I'll go ahead and unselect

00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:31.136 A:middle
proceeds, sales, in-app

00:18:31.136 --> 00:18:33.596 A:middle
purchases, and app bundles.

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.126 A:middle
Hit done and, voila, now I just

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:38.766 A:middle
see units and updates, exactly

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.446 A:middle
what's relevant for my business.

00:18:41.296 --> 00:18:43.276 A:middle
Next, we're going to take a look

00:18:43.306 --> 00:18:44.806 A:middle
at the time selection control

00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:47.076 A:middle
underneath the trends title.

00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:50.306 A:middle
In iTunes Connect mobile, we

00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:52.306 A:middle
allow you to see the status from

00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:55.116 A:middle
7 days all the way to 26 weeks.

00:18:55.436 --> 00:18:57.676 A:middle
Now this was amazing if you are

00:18:57.676 --> 00:18:58.696 A:middle
interested in longer-term

00:18:58.696 --> 00:18:59.686 A:middle
trends, right?
