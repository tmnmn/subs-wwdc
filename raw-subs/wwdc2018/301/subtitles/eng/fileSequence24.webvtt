00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:00.746 A:middle
Reject this binary.

00:24:01.026 --> 00:24:02.786 A:middle
We don't want to do that, but

00:24:02.786 --> 00:24:04.296 A:middle
now we see release this version

00:24:04.586 --> 00:24:05.856 A:middle
and that's exactly what we want

00:24:05.856 --> 00:24:06.176 A:middle
to do.

00:24:06.176 --> 00:24:06.856 A:middle
We'll tap there.

00:24:07.386 --> 00:24:08.896 A:middle
We'll get a confirmation dialog

00:24:08.896 --> 00:24:10.136 A:middle
and we'll hit release.

00:24:10.426 --> 00:24:12.576 A:middle
Now we sent that build off to

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:12.946 A:middle
the world.

00:24:13.776 --> 00:24:15.766 A:middle
Sometimes you don't get the

00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:17.576 A:middle
happiest push notifications and

00:24:17.576 --> 00:24:18.306 A:middle
this is one of them.

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:20.266 A:middle
Right. Sometimes your app may be

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:21.636 A:middle
rejected by app review.

00:24:21.636 --> 00:24:22.916 A:middle
And, obviously, that's something

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:23.986 A:middle
that no one wants to see.

00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:26.236 A:middle
Later in our session, my

00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:27.776 A:middle
colleague Daniel is going to go

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:29.156 A:middle
over some tips and tricks from

00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:30.376 A:middle
app review to make sure that

00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:31.656 A:middle
this never happens to you.

00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:33.626 A:middle
But what should we do now?

00:24:33.766 --> 00:24:34.896 A:middle
We need to make sure that we can

00:24:34.896 --> 00:24:36.716 A:middle
get this app approved and out

00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:37.316 A:middle
there to the world.

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.586 A:middle
Now what we're going to do is

00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:40.746 A:middle
open up App Store Connect.

00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:43.266 A:middle
And under App Store information,

00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:45.166 A:middle
you'll see this warning badge

00:24:45.486 --> 00:24:46.926 A:middle
next to resolution center.

00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:49.636 A:middle
Within resolution center, you'll

00:24:49.636 --> 00:24:50.896 A:middle
be able to see app reviews

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:52.346 A:middle
feedback for your app.

00:24:52.896 --> 00:24:54.836 A:middle
You can tap into one in more

00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:57.696 A:middle
detail and, of course, reply to

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:58.746 A:middle
it on the go.

00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
Now once we send our response
