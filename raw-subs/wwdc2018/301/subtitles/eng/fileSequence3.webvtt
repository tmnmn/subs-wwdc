00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:02.536 A:middle
To authenticate with the API,

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:03.546 A:middle
you'll be using

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:06.066 A:middle
industry-standard JSON web token

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:06.916 A:middle
authentication.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:08.396 A:middle
Some of you may already be

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.976 A:middle
familiar with this with other

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:11.646 A:middle
APIs you've worked with.

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:14.236 A:middle
In designing the API, we've

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:15.616 A:middle
designed it around strict

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:16.446 A:middle
convention.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:17.996 A:middle
This means whether you're

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:19.406 A:middle
looking at something like naming

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.196 A:middle
or error formats, no matter what

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.606 A:middle
corner of the API you're in,

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:25.936 A:middle
everything should feel familiar.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.296 A:middle
And finally, we've been writing

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:31.006 A:middle
extensive documentation for this

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.336 A:middle
API.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.116 A:middle
You might be looking for

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:34.826 A:middle
references around resources and

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:36.756 A:middle
their attributes or maybe you're

00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:38.216 A:middle
simply looking for a guide

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:40.476 A:middle
around how to best use this API

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:41.866 A:middle
for your use cases.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.516 A:middle
Well, either way and for many

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.876 A:middle
other scenarios, this

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.656 A:middle
documentation will be the place

00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:48.306 A:middle
to go.

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.926 A:middle
We'll be launching the API this

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:52.256 A:middle
summer.

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:53.346 A:middle
And we will be launching with

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.216 A:middle
support for the areas of the

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:56.346 A:middle
lifecycle we highlighted

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:56.846 A:middle
earlier.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.476 A:middle
Now as we add more features and

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
support for other areas, we will
