00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.616 A:middle
testers, it can be cumbersome.

00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:02.426 A:middle
And if you're working with

00:10:02.426 --> 00:10:04.286 A:middle
testers who don't have an e-mail

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:06.176 A:middle
address, there isn't an easy way

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:06.816 A:middle
to invite them.

00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:09.166 A:middle
We think we can do even better,

00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:12.036 A:middle
and we call it TestFlight public

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:12.336 A:middle
link.

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:15.246 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:15.476 --> 00:10:16.526 A:middle
This is really exciting.

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:20.146 A:middle
Public link is a unique URL that

00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:22.606 A:middle
represents an open invitation to

00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:23.286 A:middle
your beta app.

00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:25.946 A:middle
You can share it anywhere you'd

00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:26.206 A:middle
like.

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:29.166 A:middle
And it can be used by anyone to

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:32.866 A:middle
become a new tester.

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:35.366 A:middle
So public links can be shared

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.806 A:middle
anywhere that a regular link can

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:37.236 A:middle
be shared.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:39.156 A:middle
This means you can send a public

00:10:39.156 --> 00:10:41.526 A:middle
link directly to someone, or you

00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:42.816 A:middle
could share it on social media

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:44.246 A:middle
to reach a wider audience.

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:46.366 A:middle
If someone wants to become a

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:48.886 A:middle
tester, they simply tap on a

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:49.986 A:middle
link.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:51.336 A:middle
This would launch TestFlight

00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:52.736 A:middle
where they can install your beta

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.796 A:middle
app and instantly become one of

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:55.426 A:middle
your testers.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:56.766 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:10:56.876 --> 00:10:58.246 A:middle
You don't have to collect any

00:10:58.246 --> 00:10:58.906 A:middle
information.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.466 A:middle
You simply make the link
