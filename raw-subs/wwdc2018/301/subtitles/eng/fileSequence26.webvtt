00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:00.876 A:middle
so we're going to thank them for

00:26:00.876 --> 00:26:01.876 A:middle
the positive feedback.

00:26:03.156 --> 00:26:04.546 A:middle
That covers App Store Connect

00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:06.506 A:middle
notifications and the quick

00:26:06.506 --> 00:26:07.496 A:middle
actions that you can take from

00:26:07.496 --> 00:26:09.466 A:middle
them but there's one more thing.

00:26:10.366 --> 00:26:12.036 A:middle
We've also optimized App Store

00:26:12.036 --> 00:26:14.416 A:middle
Connect for iPad.

00:26:14.636 --> 00:26:15.796 A:middle
So let's take a quick look.

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.316 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, you can

00:26:18.316 --> 00:26:19.896 A:middle
view a certain apps sales and

00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:20.496 A:middle
trends data.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:22.056 A:middle
And here is sales and trends for

00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:22.856 A:middle
Forest Explorer.

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:25.146 A:middle
You can see units.

00:26:25.196 --> 00:26:26.766 A:middle
And we'll scroll down to updates

00:26:27.576 --> 00:26:29.606 A:middle
and also drill down into the

00:26:29.606 --> 00:26:30.506 A:middle
territories view.

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.376 A:middle
Now I'm sure you want to try

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:34.356 A:middle
this out on your own.

00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:36.076 A:middle
And our app is actually

00:26:36.076 --> 00:26:36.706 A:middle
available now.

00:26:36.706 --> 00:26:37.996 A:middle
So if you haven't downloaded it

00:26:38.106 --> 00:26:39.706 A:middle
already, please go ahead and do

00:26:39.706 --> 00:26:40.016 A:middle
so.

00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:41.936 A:middle
We've worked hard to bring an

00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:43.676 A:middle
experience -- an improved mobile

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:44.556 A:middle
experience to you.

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.106 A:middle
And we hope you'll enjoy using

00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.246 A:middle
it as much as we enjoyed

00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:47.796 A:middle
creating it.

00:26:48.796 --> 00:26:50.266 A:middle
And with that, now back to

00:26:50.266 --> 00:26:50.646 A:middle
Daniel.

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:57.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]
