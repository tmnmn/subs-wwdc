00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.676 A:middle
and letting you know when you

00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:01.356 A:middle
can do so.

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:03.976 A:middle
So we know that you've taken --

00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:06.036 A:middle
you've spent countless hours

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:06.726 A:middle
working on your apps.

00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:09.006 A:middle
You've distributed them to beta

00:23:09.006 --> 00:23:10.446 A:middle
testers via TestFlight.

00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:12.356 A:middle
You've taken those testers

00:23:12.356 --> 00:23:14.186 A:middle
feedback, iterated upon that

00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:16.146 A:middle
with your apps, and finally you

00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.546 A:middle
have a build that's ready for

00:23:17.546 --> 00:23:18.436 A:middle
release to the world.

00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:20.716 A:middle
Now one of the last things you

00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:22.216 A:middle
have to do before releasing your

00:23:22.216 --> 00:23:23.236 A:middle
app to the world is, of course,

00:23:23.816 --> 00:23:25.086 A:middle
submitting your build to app

00:23:25.086 --> 00:23:25.376 A:middle
review.

00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:28.906 A:middle
One of the notifications that we

00:23:28.906 --> 00:23:30.166 A:middle
just set up in the App Store

00:23:30.166 --> 00:23:31.966 A:middle
Connect app was for app status

00:23:31.966 --> 00:23:32.516 A:middle
changes.

00:23:33.186 --> 00:23:34.876 A:middle
This means that when your app is

00:23:35.006 --> 00:23:36.696 A:middle
approved by app review, you'll

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:38.856 A:middle
receive a push notification that

00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:40.526 A:middle
tells you this happy news.

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:42.946 A:middle
The second that you received one

00:23:42.946 --> 00:23:44.656 A:middle
of these notifications, you can

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.316 A:middle
open App Store Connect wherever

00:23:46.316 --> 00:23:46.776 A:middle
you are.

00:23:47.456 --> 00:23:48.986 A:middle
And we'll go to the version

00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:49.246 A:middle
view.

00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:51.546 A:middle
You'll now see that our app

00:23:51.546 --> 00:23:52.846 A:middle
Forest Explorer is pending

00:23:52.846 --> 00:23:53.746 A:middle
developer release.

00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:56.146 A:middle
We'll scroll down and you'll see

00:23:56.146 --> 00:23:56.596 A:middle
two buttons.

00:23:57.216 --> 00:23:58.366 A:middle
The first one that you'll see is

00:23:58.366 --> 00:23:59.176 A:middle
this big red button.

00:23:59.176 --> 00:23:59.886 A:middle
It's really obvious.

00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:00.746 A:middle
Reject this binary.
