00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
support for other areas, we will

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.296 A:middle
be delivering those features to

00:04:03.296 --> 00:04:03.546 A:middle
you.

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:07.566 A:middle
So going back to our lifecycle,

00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:09.136 A:middle
let's talk through some

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:11.456 A:middle
enhancements and some API

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:12.336 A:middle
integrations.

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:14.806 A:middle
We'll begin by talking about

00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:15.396 A:middle
provisioning.

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:22.046 A:middle
Now today, many of you rely on

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.406 A:middle
Xcode to manage your

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:24.656 A:middle
provisioning automatically.

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:26.246 A:middle
But for some of you who are

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:26.976 A:middle
looking for a little more

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:29.116 A:middle
control, today you sign into the

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:31.686 A:middle
Apple Developer website to

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.086 A:middle
generate the resources you need

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:34.806 A:middle
to sign your apps.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.026 A:middle
Well, with the API this summer,

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:39.656 A:middle
you'll be able to do a lot of

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:40.786 A:middle
these things directly.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.276 A:middle
The API will support generating

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:45.526 A:middle
provisioning profiles, creating

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:46.576 A:middle
and revoking signing

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:48.726 A:middle
certificates as well as managing

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.156 A:middle
your devices and your app bundle

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:51.246 A:middle
IDs.

00:04:51.246 --> 00:04:53.876 A:middle
This should make it a little bit

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.756 A:middle
easier for you to integrate your

00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:57.326 A:middle
provisioning activities into

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:58.656 A:middle
your automation process.

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:05.546 A:middle
