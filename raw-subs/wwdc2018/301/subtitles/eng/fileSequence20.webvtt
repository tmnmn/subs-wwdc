00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:01.516 A:middle
deeper dive into any one of

00:20:01.516 --> 00:20:02.876 A:middle
these cells just by tapping on

00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
them.

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:05.636 A:middle
So let's go ahead and tap the

00:20:05.636 --> 00:20:07.686 A:middle
free iOS/tvOS app cell.

00:20:09.036 --> 00:20:11.086 A:middle
Now you can see data about each

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.576 A:middle
one of your apps in more detail

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:14.816 A:middle
and also your apps top

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:15.476 A:middle
territories.

00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:17.906 A:middle
If you're interested in seeing

00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:19.646 A:middle
more territories, you can tap

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:20.446 A:middle
the show more button.

00:20:20.446 --> 00:20:22.966 A:middle
Now you can see the territories

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.486 A:middle
that your apps are available in

00:20:24.486 --> 00:20:25.186 A:middle
worldwide.

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.636 A:middle
You can also take a look at your

00:20:28.636 --> 00:20:30.086 A:middle
apps data individually as

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:31.356 A:middle
opposed to this aggregate view

00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:33.356 A:middle
by taking a look at the my apps

00:20:33.476 --> 00:20:35.456 A:middle
tab which we'll do next.

00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:38.176 A:middle
When you tap into the my apps

00:20:38.176 --> 00:20:39.616 A:middle
tab, you'll see a list of your

00:20:39.616 --> 00:20:40.346 A:middle
apps, obviously.

00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:42.576 A:middle
But what if you're a member of

00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:43.936 A:middle
more than one development team?

00:20:43.936 --> 00:20:45.286 A:middle
So do we have anyone in the

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.816 A:middle
audience that is, indeed, a

00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:47.526 A:middle
member of more than one

00:20:47.526 --> 00:20:48.186 A:middle
development team?

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.306 A:middle
Cool. So it's actually quite a

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:50.746 A:middle
bit of you.

00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:51.986 A:middle
So that's awesome.

00:20:52.046 --> 00:20:53.596 A:middle
And that's exactly why we've

00:20:53.596 --> 00:20:55.636 A:middle
introduce the ability to select

00:20:55.786 --> 00:20:57.276 A:middle
which development team you'd

00:20:57.276 --> 00:20:58.796 A:middle
like to see within App Store

00:20:58.796 --> 00:20:59.146 A:middle
Connect.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.516 A:middle
So we'll tap the little account
