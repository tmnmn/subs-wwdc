00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:00.596 A:middle
renovations on our App Store.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.465 A:middle
So last year, we went back and

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.726 A:middle
we redesigned the iOS App Store.

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.896 A:middle
And following the success of

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:12.736 A:middle
that redesign, this year we also

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.556 A:middle
redesigned the Mac App Store.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:17.546 A:middle
Now with this Mac App Store

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:19.846 A:middle
redesign, we've added support

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.126 A:middle
for a few new features including

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.766 A:middle
app subtitles and app previews.

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:26.446 A:middle
You can take advantage of these

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.126 A:middle
features by signing into App

00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:30.246 A:middle
Store Connect or by using the

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:31.856 A:middle
XML feed if you use that for

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:32.756 A:middle
automation today.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:37.116 A:middle
Now for today's session, we're

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:40.686 A:middle
going to focus on enhancements

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:42.566 A:middle
we've made to App Store Connect.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.646 A:middle
And we're going to talk about it

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.686 A:middle
within the context of your app

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:46.516 A:middle
lifecycle.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:49.186 A:middle
This lifecycle typically begins

00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:50.766 A:middle
with the design phase.

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:54.426 A:middle
This phase can be both visual or

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:55.106 A:middle
in code.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.126 A:middle
And as you make your way around

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:58.746 A:middle
this lifecycle, you eventually

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:00.486 A:middle
end up with your app on the App
