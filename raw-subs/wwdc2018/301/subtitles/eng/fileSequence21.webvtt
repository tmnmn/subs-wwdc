00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.516 A:middle
So we'll tap the little account

00:21:01.546 --> 00:21:01.876 A:middle
button.

00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:03.966 A:middle
That brings up settings.

00:21:04.046 --> 00:21:05.576 A:middle
And you'll see the account cell.

00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:08.536 A:middle
We'll tap into that, select the

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.936 A:middle
team that we'd like to see

00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:12.096 A:middle
within App Store Connect, and

00:21:12.216 --> 00:21:13.036 A:middle
dismiss this.

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.486 A:middle
Now we see exactly the apps that

00:21:15.486 --> 00:21:16.806 A:middle
we're interested in right now.

00:21:18.606 --> 00:21:20.246 A:middle
Let's go ahead and take a look

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:21.766 A:middle
at one of the apps within our

00:21:21.766 --> 00:21:23.606 A:middle
apps list, Mountain Climber.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:25.816 A:middle
When we tap into Mountain

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:26.736 A:middle
Climber, you'll see four

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:27.316 A:middle
sections.

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:29.386 A:middle
The first section that you see

00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:30.986 A:middle
is the iOS app section.

00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:32.606 A:middle
And here you'll see your iOS

00:21:32.606 --> 00:21:33.106 A:middle
versions.

00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:35.856 A:middle
If your app has a tvOS app

00:21:35.936 --> 00:21:38.326 A:middle
version, you'll see the tvOS app

00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:40.096 A:middle
section and, obviously, the tvOS

00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:41.496 A:middle
app versions underneath.

00:21:42.116 --> 00:21:44.496 A:middle
Now we also have App Store

00:21:44.496 --> 00:21:45.296 A:middle
information.

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:46.966 A:middle
And remember that I noted that

00:21:46.966 --> 00:21:48.706 A:middle
you can see your apps trends

00:21:48.706 --> 00:21:49.556 A:middle
data individually.

00:21:49.806 --> 00:21:51.686 A:middle
Well, all you have to do is tap

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:52.946 A:middle
into that cell and you'll be

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:53.476 A:middle
taken there.

00:21:54.206 --> 00:21:56.116 A:middle
Now, finally we have

00:21:56.186 --> 00:21:57.086 A:middle
notifications.

00:21:57.786 --> 00:21:59.316 A:middle
And we're going to do something

00:21:59.316 --> 00:22:00.556 A:middle
a bit unorthodox here.
