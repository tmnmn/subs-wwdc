00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.636 A:middle
Now many of you today are using

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:03.086 A:middle
our tool called Transporter.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.426 A:middle
For those of you who aren't

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:05.866 A:middle
familiar, Transporter is our

00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:07.476 A:middle
command line tool that does many

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:08.966 A:middle
things and one of those is

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.336 A:middle
delivering your builds into our

00:08:10.336 --> 00:08:10.766 A:middle
system.

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:12.976 A:middle
For those of you who use

00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:15.076 A:middle
Transporter today, you know that

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:17.216 A:middle
macOS is a supported platform.

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:20.926 A:middle
Well, we also know that many of

00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:22.266 A:middle
you use Linux for things like

00:08:22.366 --> 00:08:24.716 A:middle
continuous integration, which is

00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:26.556 A:middle
why this summer we'll be adding

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.826 A:middle
Linux as a supported platform

00:08:28.906 --> 00:08:29.796 A:middle
for Transporter.

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:33.856 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:34.356 --> 00:08:35.256 A:middle
Now you'll continue using

00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:36.645 A:middle
Transporter the same way you do

00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:37.025 A:middle
today.

00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:40.326 A:middle
And Transporter will continue

00:08:40.326 --> 00:08:42.376 A:middle
allowing you to validate your

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:44.236 A:middle
builds before you deliver them.

00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:46.266 A:middle
This will save you a lot of time

00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:47.716 A:middle
because you'll know whether your

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:48.996 A:middle
builds are in a good state

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:50.946 A:middle
before you push us all of the

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:51.436 A:middle
bits.

00:08:52.996 --> 00:08:54.676 A:middle
And once we launch the API this

00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:56.726 A:middle
summer, in addition to the

00:08:56.726 --> 00:08:58.196 A:middle
username and password

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.256 A:middle
authentication that you can do

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
today, you'll also be able to
