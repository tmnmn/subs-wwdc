00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.466 A:middle
You simply make the link

00:11:00.466 --> 00:11:02.126 A:middle
available and testers can join.

00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:06.426 A:middle
So let me show how we can create

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:07.066 A:middle
a public link.

00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:10.826 A:middle
In TestFlight, groups allow you

00:11:10.826 --> 00:11:12.506 A:middle
to organize your testers and

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:14.706 A:middle
decide which builds each group

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:16.156 A:middle
of testers should have access

00:11:16.186 --> 00:11:16.386 A:middle
to.

00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:18.616 A:middle
We'll need to create a group

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:19.926 A:middle
before we can generate a public

00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:20.206 A:middle
link.

00:11:20.536 --> 00:11:22.066 A:middle
And we can do that by clicking

00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:24.936 A:middle
new group in the left nav and

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:28.746 A:middle
then giving the group a name.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.476 A:middle
Now before we create a public

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:32.116 A:middle
link and start bringing testers

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:33.816 A:middle
in, we want to make sure there

00:11:33.816 --> 00:11:35.246 A:middle
is a build that they can test.

00:11:35.936 --> 00:11:38.066 A:middle
So first we'll add a build to

00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:38.526 A:middle
this group.

00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:41.276 A:middle
We do that by going to the

00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:43.366 A:middle
builds tab and clicking the plus

00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.146 A:middle
button next to build.

00:11:46.036 --> 00:11:47.886 A:middle
This will show all the builds

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:48.496 A:middle
we've uploaded.

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:50.266 A:middle
And we can choose one that we

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:51.006 A:middle
want to distribute.

00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:55.416 A:middle
Now that this group has a build,

00:11:55.526 --> 00:11:57.206 A:middle
we can create a public link for

00:11:57.206 --> 00:11:57.676 A:middle
this group.

00:11:58.166 --> 00:12:00.726 A:middle
We'll go back to the testers tab
