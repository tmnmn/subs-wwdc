00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:07.976 A:middle
So early on in the lifecycle

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:09.286 A:middle
while you're thinking about

00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:10.806 A:middle
provisioning, you're probably

00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:12.816 A:middle
also thinking about managing

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:13.686 A:middle
your users.

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:16.726 A:middle
Now the API is going to support

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:19.136 A:middle
inviting new users to App Store

00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:21.906 A:middle
Connect, modifying which apps

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:24.286 A:middle
your users can see, managing

00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:26.116 A:middle
your user's roles as well as

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:28.086 A:middle
updating profile details.

00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:31.566 A:middle
Now we didn't want to stop at

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:32.716 A:middle
simplifying your management

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.286 A:middle
experience with just the API.

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:36.596 A:middle
We also wanted to take a look at

00:05:36.596 --> 00:05:38.646 A:middle
how we could simplify where you

00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:40.306 A:middle
go to manage your users in the

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:41.066 A:middle
first place.

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
Today, you go to both App Store

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:47.156 A:middle
Connect and the Apple Developer

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:47.736 A:middle
website.

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:50.536 A:middle
But starting this summer, you'll

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:52.746 A:middle
be able to go to just one place.

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:00.716 A:middle
And that's App Store Connect.
