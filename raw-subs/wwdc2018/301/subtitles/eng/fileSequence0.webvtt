&gt;&gt; Hey everyone.

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:28.996 A:middle
Welcome to our session on what's

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:30.326 A:middle
new in App Store Connect?

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:31.696 A:middle
My name is Daniel Miao.

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.276 A:middle
And I'm an engineering manager

00:00:33.276 --> 00:00:35.216 A:middle
on the App Store Connect team.

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:37.096 A:middle
So what's new?

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.136 A:middle
Well, first off, you may have

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.676 A:middle
noticed we changed our name.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:45.666 A:middle
This is really just a small part

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.786 A:middle
of our ongoing commitment to

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:48.956 A:middle
building the best tools and

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.786 A:middle
services focused on you, our

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:53.146 A:middle
developers building apps for the

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:53.696 A:middle
App Store.

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:56.696 A:middle
Now along these lines, we've

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.046 A:middle
also been undergoing a few

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:00.596 A:middle
renovations on our App Store.
