end up with your app on the App

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.006 A:middle
Store followed with an analysis

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.806 A:middle
of how your app is doing on the

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.366 A:middle
App Store.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:08.816 A:middle
Now more specifically, we're

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.265 A:middle
going to focus on a few key

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.886 A:middle
areas of this lifecycle.

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:13.356 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:16.026 A:middle
changes to provisioning, user

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:18.826 A:middle
management, delivering your app

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:22.186 A:middle
into our system, beta testing

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:25.476 A:middle
the builds, and analyzing your

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:26.896 A:middle
biggest business drivers.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:28.966 A:middle
Now looking at all these

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:30.996 A:middle
different areas, you can imagine

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:32.706 A:middle
how something like automation

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.256 A:middle
could bring all these together

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:35.096 A:middle
quite nicely.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.826 A:middle
And we tend to agree which is

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:39.496 A:middle
why we're very excited because

00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:41.236 A:middle
this summer we'll be releasing

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:42.996 A:middle
an all-new product focused

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.176 A:middle
around automation and we call it

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.546 A:middle
the App Store Connect API.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:52.296 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:54.616 A:middle
Now the App Store Connect API is

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:57.386 A:middle
simply a RESTful interface into

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.796 A:middle
your app management experience.
