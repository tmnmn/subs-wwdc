Today, in order to download your

00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:02.086 A:middle
generated reports, you use a

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.736 A:middle
reporter tool but beginning this

00:16:04.736 --> 00:16:06.336 A:middle
summer you'll be able to do the

00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:08.036 A:middle
same thing directly with the

00:16:08.036 --> 00:16:08.436 A:middle
API.

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:10.516 A:middle
And we'll be supporting the

00:16:10.516 --> 00:16:11.866 A:middle
download of both financial

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:14.786 A:middle
reports and sales reports.

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:16.716 A:middle
This will make it easier for you

00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:19.196 A:middle
to integrate reporting in to

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:20.116 A:middle
your process.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:24.176 A:middle
So we've been talking about a

00:16:24.176 --> 00:16:25.156 A:middle
lot of features.

00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:26.856 A:middle
And so far they've mostly been

00:16:26.856 --> 00:16:29.126 A:middle
centered around your web and

00:16:29.126 --> 00:16:30.416 A:middle
your desktop experience.

00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:33.186 A:middle
So now we'd like to move on and

00:16:33.186 --> 00:16:35.066 A:middle
talk about our all new mobile

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:35.746 A:middle
experience.

00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:36.986 A:middle
And I'd like to invite Alex

00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:38.976 A:middle
Miyamura up to the stage to tell

00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:39.776 A:middle
you all about it.

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:46.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:47.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Daniel.

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:50.346 A:middle
We know that the involvement

00:16:50.606 --> 00:16:52.196 A:middle
with your apps doesn't stop the

00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:53.486 A:middle
moment that you step away from

00:16:53.486 --> 00:16:53.946 A:middle
your Mac.

00:16:54.866 --> 00:16:56.166 A:middle
You may have a version of one of

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.156 A:middle
your apps that you've been

00:16:57.446 --> 00:17:00.066 A:middle
working on hard for quite a long
