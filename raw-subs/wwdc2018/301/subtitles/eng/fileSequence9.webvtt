00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:00.996 A:middle
today, you'll also be able to

00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:03.056 A:middle
use the same API tokens that you

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:04.816 A:middle
use with the rest of the App

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:05.996 A:middle
Store Connect API.

00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:11.456 A:middle
Okay. So now that we have a few

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:13.546 A:middle
builds in the system, it's time

00:09:13.796 --> 00:09:14.646 A:middle
to beta test them.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.576 A:middle
And, of course, beta testing

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.246 A:middle
means TestFlight.

00:09:18.656 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
We've got a few enhancements to

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:20.896 A:middle
TestFlight.

00:09:20.986 --> 00:09:22.596 A:middle
And I'd like to invite Tommy

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:24.106 A:middle
McGlynn up to the stage to tell

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:24.976 A:middle
you all about them.

00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:28.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:29.446 --> 00:09:30.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Daniel.

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:32.866 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:34.126 A:middle
again talking to you about

00:09:34.126 --> 00:09:34.686 A:middle
TestFlight.

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:36.626 A:middle
We've got a new feature to tell

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:38.336 A:middle
you about, and it deals with

00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:39.846 A:middle
tester acquisition.

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:42.756 A:middle
Today, all you need to invite

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:44.246 A:middle
someone to TestFlight is their

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:44.956 A:middle
e-mail address.

00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:47.206 A:middle
You simply enter their e-mail

00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:48.806 A:middle
and they'll be sent an

00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:49.396 A:middle
invitation.

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:52.736 A:middle
Tapping on the invitation will

00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:54.076 A:middle
launch TestFlight where they can

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:55.376 A:middle
install your beta app.

00:09:55.946 --> 00:09:58.086 A:middle
It's pretty awesome, but if

00:09:58.086 --> 00:09:58.926 A:middle
you're dealing with a lot of

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.616 A:middle
testers, it can be cumbersome.
