00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.566 A:middle
But what about an app that you

00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:02.516 A:middle
just released?

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:04.686 A:middle
You might not even have 7 days'

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:05.366 A:middle
worth of data.

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.096 A:middle
And if you want to compare those

00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:08.496 A:middle
7 days to the previous 7 days,

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:09.726 A:middle
well obviously you're not going

00:19:09.806 --> 00:19:10.406 A:middle
to have that.

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:12.806 A:middle
So in App Store Connect, we

00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:15.006 A:middle
introduce the 1 day view.

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:17.156 A:middle
In this view, you can see how

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.436 A:middle
your apps are during day over

00:19:18.436 --> 00:19:20.616 A:middle
day even just a few days after

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:21.046 A:middle
launch.

00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:23.666 A:middle
Of course, some of you are still

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:24.806 A:middle
going to be interested in

00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:26.126 A:middle
longer-term trends, right?

00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:27.706 A:middle
So we still offer you the

00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:29.626 A:middle
ability to view your apps data

00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:35.516 A:middle
over 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 13 weeks,

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:37.956 A:middle
and 26 weeks.

00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:40.446 A:middle
You can also drill down into

00:19:40.486 --> 00:19:42.106 A:middle
each one of these graphs in more

00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:42.596 A:middle
detail.

00:19:42.886 --> 00:19:44.346 A:middle
So we're going to take a look at

00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:45.116 A:middle
units right now.

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:47.576 A:middle
When you tap into one of these

00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:49.076 A:middle
graphs, you'll see a breakdown

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:50.616 A:middle
across your free apps, your paid

00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:52.416 A:middle
apps, and in-apps for the

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:55.406 A:middle
iOS/tvOS App Stores as well as

00:19:55.406 --> 00:19:57.576 A:middle
the redesigned Mac App Store.

00:19:58.346 --> 00:19:59.756 A:middle
You can also take a look at a

00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:01.516 A:middle
deeper dive into any one of
