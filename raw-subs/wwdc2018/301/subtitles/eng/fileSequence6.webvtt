00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:00.716 A:middle
And that's App Store Connect.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:03.256 A:middle
Coming to App Store Connect,

00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:04.266 A:middle
you'll be able to think about

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.836 A:middle
all of your users within the

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:07.686 A:middle
context of just one set of

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:08.176 A:middle
roles.

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:10.726 A:middle
And you can manage just one

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:12.556 A:middle
account for each of your Apple

00:06:12.556 --> 00:06:13.016 A:middle
IDs.

00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:16.136 A:middle
Now we know that App Store

00:06:16.136 --> 00:06:17.536 A:middle
Connect and the Apple Developer

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:19.046 A:middle
website, they're very different

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:19.496 A:middle
systems.

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:21.786 A:middle
So you might be wondering how is

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.206 A:middle
all this going to come together?

00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:25.056 A:middle
Well, that's why we've built a

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:26.776 A:middle
way for you to see how your

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:27.796 A:middle
user's permissions will be

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.326 A:middle
changing once this process is

00:06:30.326 --> 00:06:30.856 A:middle
complete.

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.546 A:middle
Once we have this preview

00:06:33.546 --> 00:06:35.366 A:middle
available, we'll let you know

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:37.686 A:middle
via Developer News and on the

00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:39.306 A:middle
App Store Connect home page.

00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:42.026 A:middle
From here, you can click into a

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:43.426 A:middle
page that looks sort of like

00:06:43.476 --> 00:06:43.896 A:middle
this.

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:46.006 A:middle
Here you'll see a list of all of

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:48.206 A:middle
your users as well as a summary

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.686 A:middle
of how their roles will be

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:50.206 A:middle
changing.

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:52.636 A:middle
Of course, some of your users

00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:54.136 A:middle
won't be changing at all.

00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:57.596 A:middle
Now if you click into a single

00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:58.976 A:middle
one of these users, you'll be
