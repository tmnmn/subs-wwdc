00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.806 A:middle
period, the regular subscription

00:31:01.806 --> 00:31:03.006 A:middle
price kicks in.

00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:06.886 A:middle
And finally, we have pay as you

00:31:06.886 --> 00:31:07.236 A:middle
go.

00:31:07.856 --> 00:31:09.006 A:middle
With pay as you go, your

00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:11.246 A:middle
customers pay a recurring

00:31:11.356 --> 00:31:13.416 A:middle
discounted price during the

00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:14.486 A:middle
introductory period.

00:31:15.066 --> 00:31:17.446 A:middle
Now once the entire period has

00:31:17.446 --> 00:31:19.486 A:middle
been completed then they move on

00:31:19.486 --> 00:31:20.546 A:middle
to the regular subscription

00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:21.026 A:middle
price.

00:31:21.586 --> 00:31:23.576 A:middle
Now we have two related sessions

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:25.386 A:middle
that happened yesterday that

00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:26.656 A:middle
have more information around the

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:28.846 A:middle
StoreKit side and best practices

00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:30.756 A:middle
around both intro pricing and

00:31:30.756 --> 00:31:31.506 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.336 A:middle
They are Best Practices and

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:34.776 A:middle
What's New with In-App Purchases

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:36.386 A:middle
and Engineering Subscriptions.

00:31:36.386 --> 00:31:38.376 A:middle
So check those out if you have a

00:31:38.376 --> 00:31:38.836 A:middle
chance.

00:31:39.586 --> 00:31:42.986 A:middle
So next we have pre-orders.

00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:44.876 A:middle
Now pre-orders are a great way

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:46.096 A:middle
for you to drum up excitement

00:31:46.096 --> 00:31:48.056 A:middle
for your app before your app is

00:31:48.056 --> 00:31:50.116 A:middle
actually available for download

00:31:50.446 --> 00:31:51.246 A:middle
or purchase.

00:31:51.816 --> 00:31:54.346 A:middle
In order to set up a pre-order,

00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:56.726 A:middle
you can take any app that has

00:31:56.726 --> 00:31:58.046 A:middle
not yet been released on the App

00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:01.186 A:middle
