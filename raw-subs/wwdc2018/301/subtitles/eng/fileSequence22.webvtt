00:21:59.316 --> 00:22:00.556 A:middle
a bit unorthodox here.

00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:01.546 A:middle
We're actually going to start

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:02.906 A:middle
from all the way at the bottom

00:22:03.526 --> 00:22:04.506 A:middle
with notifications.

00:22:06.216 --> 00:22:06.996 A:middle
There are two types of

00:22:06.996 --> 00:22:08.176 A:middle
notifications that you can

00:22:08.176 --> 00:22:10.066 A:middle
receive within the App Store

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:10.666 A:middle
Connect app.

00:22:11.386 --> 00:22:13.076 A:middle
The first one is for app status

00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:13.536 A:middle
changes.

00:22:13.896 --> 00:22:15.436 A:middle
And this is something like when

00:22:15.436 --> 00:22:17.726 A:middle
your app is in review and then

00:22:17.726 --> 00:22:19.906 A:middle
goes to pending developer

00:22:19.906 --> 00:22:20.906 A:middle
release when it's approved.

00:22:21.686 --> 00:22:23.566 A:middle
The next one that you can take

00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:26.346 A:middle
is for reviews with a certain

00:22:26.506 --> 00:22:27.206 A:middle
star rating.

00:22:28.006 --> 00:22:29.546 A:middle
And so we're going to go ahead

00:22:29.546 --> 00:22:31.676 A:middle
and select the five-star review

00:22:31.846 --> 00:22:33.276 A:middle
because we want to thank users

00:22:33.346 --> 00:22:35.626 A:middle
that are enjoying our app as

00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:37.446 A:middle
well as the one-star review

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.986 A:middle
because we want to engage users

00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:40.356 A:middle
that, for whatever reason, are

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:41.596 A:middle
not having the best of

00:22:41.596 --> 00:22:42.416 A:middle
experiences.

00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:44.696 A:middle
Now that we've selected our

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.916 A:middle
notifications, we're going to go

00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.776 A:middle
back to the app view.

00:22:47.996 --> 00:22:49.486 A:middle
The reason why we started with

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:51.506 A:middle
notifications is because one of

00:22:51.506 --> 00:22:53.086 A:middle
the key tenets of the App Store

00:22:53.086 --> 00:22:55.286 A:middle
Connect experience on iOS is

00:22:55.286 --> 00:22:56.806 A:middle
giving you the ability to take a

00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:58.776 A:middle
quick action around your apps

00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.676 A:middle
and letting you know when you
