00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:15.686 A:middle
deep dive of the API and show

00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:19.456 A:middle
you how to use the API at a much

00:36:19.626 --> 00:36:20.216 A:middle
deeper level.

00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:23.886 A:middle
We also have two labs coming up,

00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:25.286 A:middle
one tomorrow and one the day

00:36:25.286 --> 00:36:25.696 A:middle
after.

00:36:25.696 --> 00:36:26.826 A:middle
So if you'd like to come and

00:36:26.826 --> 00:36:28.716 A:middle

00:36:30.266 --> 00:36:31.396 A:middle
