00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:00.566 A:middle
Right? It should a little bit

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:01.946 A:middle
clear here that this test is

00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:03.686 A:middle
testing way too many components.

00:08:04.056 --> 00:08:05.096 A:middle
It's testing our Game.

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:06.596 A:middle
It's testing our Shaders.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.606 A:middle
And it's testing our Utilities.

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:11.866 A:middle
Now in this case, it'd be better

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.426 A:middle
to simply break up our tests so

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.366 A:middle
that it's testing each

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:15.356 A:middle
individual component.

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:17.586 A:middle
And we're going to see by doing

00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:18.686 A:middle
this, we're going to introduce

00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:20.416 A:middle
our first bit of parallelism

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.766 A:middle
into our build process.

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:25.246 A:middle
Right? Our test target, which

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:26.676 A:middle
was built in all three can now

00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:27.926 A:middle
build just the component that

00:08:27.926 --> 00:08:28.956 A:middle
it's looking for in the Game

00:08:28.956 --> 00:08:29.466 A:middle
tests.

00:08:30.436 --> 00:08:31.896 A:middle
And then our Shaders tests and

00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:33.816 A:middle
our Utilities tests can be moved

00:08:33.816 --> 00:08:34.996 A:middle
to be built in parallel with our

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:35.775 A:middle
other targets.

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:37.236 A:middle
And they can be built as soon as

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:38.395 A:middle
their respective components are

00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:40.456 A:middle
done, Shaders and Utilities.

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:44.626 A:middle
Now, the next type of dependency

00:08:44.626 --> 00:08:46.696 A:middle
I want to look at is the

00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:48.526 A:middle
dependency that I call the "Nosy

00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:49.126 A:middle
Neighbors."

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:51.596 A:middle
This is the dependency that

00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:53.426 A:middle
needs to exist.

00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:54.806 A:middle
It's look at another target.

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.636 A:middle
But it only needs a little bit

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:57.226 A:middle
of that target.

00:08:57.946 --> 00:08:59.276 A:middle
But instead it's getting

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:00.146 A:middle
everything that's in that
