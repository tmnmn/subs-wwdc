00:33:59.086 --> 00:34:00.816 A:middle
exposed to Objective-C.

00:34:00.916 --> 00:34:02.056 A:middle
It doesn't actually need to be

00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:03.786 A:middle
used from any other files in my

00:34:03.786 --> 00:34:06.046 A:middle
project, Swift or Objective-C.

00:34:06.486 --> 00:34:09.286 A:middle
So I can mark it private.

00:34:10.106 --> 00:34:11.775 A:middle
And once again have that

00:34:11.775 --> 00:34:13.326 A:middle
reduction in the shape of my

00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:14.176 A:middle
generated header.

00:34:14.815 --> 00:34:17.255 A:middle
In cases like this, there's

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:19.246 A:middle
often another option as well.

00:34:19.596 --> 00:34:20.585 A:middle
And that's to switch to

00:34:20.585 --> 00:34:21.896 A:middle
block-based API's.

00:34:22.775 --> 00:34:24.166 A:middle
In many cases, this can even

00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:25.866 A:middle
clear up your code because you

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:27.536 A:middle
can implicitly capture state

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:28.485 A:middle
from the function that's

00:34:28.485 --> 00:34:30.016 A:middle
registering for the notification

00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:31.516 A:middle
rather than having to carry it

00:34:31.516 --> 00:34:33.065 A:middle
along as some kind of context

00:34:33.065 --> 00:34:33.456 A:middle
object.

00:34:34.076 --> 00:34:37.286 A:middle
Now, the last tip for reducing

00:34:37.286 --> 00:34:38.485 A:middle
the contents of your generated

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:41.235 A:middle
header is actually a very old

00:34:41.235 --> 00:34:41.576 A:middle
one.

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:43.255 A:middle
You can migrate to Swift 4.

00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:45.646 A:middle
And you've already heard that

00:34:45.646 --> 00:34:46.706 A:middle
you're going to have to do that

00:34:46.706 --> 00:34:47.216 A:middle
this year.

00:34:47.596 --> 00:34:49.076 A:middle
That Xcode 10 will be the last

00:34:49.076 --> 00:34:51.795 A:middle
set of releases where Swift 3

00:34:51.795 --> 00:34:52.886 A:middle
mode is supported.

00:34:53.976 --> 00:34:56.386 A:middle
And so, this is something you'll

00:34:56.386 --> 00:34:57.946 A:middle
be doing anyway.

00:34:57.976 --> 00:34:59.166 A:middle
Edit. Convert.

00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:01.076 A:middle
To Current Swift Syntax.
