00:23:59.156 --> 00:24:01.446 A:middle
But, this may not be the best

00:24:01.446 --> 00:24:02.706 A:middle
solution for this particular

00:24:02.706 --> 00:24:03.256 A:middle
problem.

00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:04.676 A:middle
So let's go back to what we had

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:05.116 A:middle
before.

00:24:06.686 --> 00:24:08.416 A:middle
Recall that I said that I'm

00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:09.646 A:middle
trying to write a single

00:24:09.646 --> 00:24:11.596 A:middle
expression here so that it can

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:13.026 A:middle
be used to help determine the

00:24:13.026 --> 00:24:13.996 A:middle
type of the closure.

00:24:15.176 --> 00:24:16.846 A:middle
But in this case, that's not

00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:17.856 A:middle
really necessary.

00:24:18.716 --> 00:24:20.316 A:middle
We already know from the call to

00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:22.366 A:middle
Reduce what this closure has to

00:24:22.366 --> 00:24:22.916 A:middle
be.

00:24:23.266 --> 00:24:24.716 A:middle
Reduce is being called on an

00:24:24.716 --> 00:24:26.156 A:middle
array of optional integers.

00:24:26.766 --> 00:24:28.736 A:middle
And the result type has to match

00:24:28.776 --> 00:24:30.126 A:middle
the return type of the function.

00:24:31.076 --> 00:24:33.186 A:middle
So we already know that this

00:24:33.486 --> 00:24:35.576 A:middle
callback for Reduce is going to

00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:37.106 A:middle
be operating just on optional

00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:37.746 A:middle
integers.

00:24:38.336 --> 00:24:40.136 A:middle
That means there's no need to

00:24:40.136 --> 00:24:41.576 A:middle
put a single expression in that

00:24:41.576 --> 00:24:42.046 A:middle
closure.

00:24:42.436 --> 00:24:44.626 A:middle
And it's perfectly okay to break

00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:46.146 A:middle
it up into separate, more

00:24:46.146 --> 00:24:47.146 A:middle
readable statements.

00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:49.966 A:middle
So here's a direct translation

00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:51.306 A:middle
of the code that I had before.

00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:53.936 A:middle
But I also have the freedom now

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:55.206 A:middle
to make it something more

00:24:55.206 --> 00:24:55.776 A:middle
Swifty.

00:24:56.196 --> 00:24:57.806 A:middle
This is a lot more readable.

00:24:58.076 --> 00:24:59.346 A:middle
A lot more maintainable.

00:24:59.686 --> 00:25:01.226 A:middle
And it compiles in a quick,
