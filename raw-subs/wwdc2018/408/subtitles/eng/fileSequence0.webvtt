00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and good morning

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:31.906 A:middle
everybody.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:32.896 A:middle
I'm glad you could all make it

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:33.536 A:middle
out this morning.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.316 A:middle
My name is David Owens.

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.006 A:middle
And I'm an engineer on the Xcode

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:37.346 A:middle
team.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:39.566 A:middle
And today, with my colleague

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.026 A:middle
Jordan Rose, who's an engineer

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:42.556 A:middle
on the Swift team, we're going

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:44.406 A:middle
to be talking to you about

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:46.136 A:middle
building faster in Xcode.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:48.626 A:middle
Now, depending on your projects,

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:49.826 A:middle
their configurations, and their

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:51.516 A:middle
complexities, there's going to

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:52.106 A:middle
be a different set of

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:53.646 A:middle
opportunities that you're going

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.396 A:middle
to be able to take to improve,

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.496 A:middle
or in some cases, significantly

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:58.936 A:middle
improve the way in which your

00:00:58.936 --> 00:00:59.736 A:middle
builds perform.
