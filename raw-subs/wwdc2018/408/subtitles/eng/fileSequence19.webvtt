00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:00.886 A:middle
small change.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.116 A:middle
And before we get to the

00:19:02.116 --> 00:19:03.346 A:middle
source-level and file-level

00:19:03.346 --> 00:19:05.256 A:middle
topics, I want to talk about one

00:19:05.256 --> 00:19:07.016 A:middle
more that's new in Xcode 10.

00:19:07.016 --> 00:19:10.656 A:middle
And it's a particular workaround

00:19:10.656 --> 00:19:11.626 A:middle
that we know that some of you

00:19:11.626 --> 00:19:13.096 A:middle
have been using on your projects

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:14.666 A:middle
to make them build faster if

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:15.976 A:middle
they have a lot of Swift files.

00:19:17.696 --> 00:19:18.936 A:middle
You've already heard about this.

00:19:19.636 --> 00:19:21.026 A:middle
It's the Whole Module setting

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.186 A:middle
being used in a debug

00:19:22.186 --> 00:19:23.166 A:middle
configuration.

00:19:23.966 --> 00:19:25.266 A:middle
So, in previous versions of

00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:27.236 A:middle
Xcode, for some projects,

00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:28.446 A:middle
turning on the Whole Module

00:19:28.446 --> 00:19:30.646 A:middle
Compilation mode, even for debug

00:19:30.706 --> 00:19:32.496 A:middle
builds, produced a faster

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:34.886 A:middle
overall build than when used in

00:19:34.886 --> 00:19:36.336 A:middle
Default Incremental Modes.

00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:39.186 A:middle
And, this did improve build

00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:40.846 A:middle
times because it was able to

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.656 A:middle
share -- Swift's compiler was

00:19:42.656 --> 00:19:44.546 A:middle
able to share work across files

00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:46.026 A:middle
in a way that the Incremental

00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:46.846 A:middle
Mode was not.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.576 A:middle
But it also meant that you were

00:19:48.576 --> 00:19:49.806 A:middle
giving up your incremental

00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:51.286 A:middle
builds and would rebuild the

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:52.826 A:middle
entire target's worth of Swift

00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:54.446 A:middle
files every time.

00:19:55.346 --> 00:19:57.266 A:middle
So in Xcode 10 we've improved

00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:58.926 A:middle
the incremental build to have

00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:00.546 A:middle
some of that same work sharing
