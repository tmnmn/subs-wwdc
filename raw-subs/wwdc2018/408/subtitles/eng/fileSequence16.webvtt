00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.016 A:middle
So, cycles are bad for a couple

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:02.636 A:middle
of reasons.

00:16:02.716 --> 00:16:04.516 A:middle
One, they represent a

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:05.956 A:middle
configuration issue within your

00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:06.386 A:middle
project.

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:08.846 A:middle
And two, they can be the source

00:16:08.846 --> 00:16:10.176 A:middle
of spurious rebuilds within your

00:16:10.176 --> 00:16:10.676 A:middle
project.

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.346 A:middle
Or of getting out-of-date

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.346 A:middle
information in your build

00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:13.956 A:middle
process.

00:16:15.176 --> 00:16:17.236 A:middle
So we also have updated health

00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:19.156 A:middle
topics on dependency cycles,

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.356 A:middle
including some specific sections

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:26.086 A:middle
that we call out of the most

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:28.236 A:middle
likely dependency cycles that

00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:29.626 A:middle
you run into, and ways that you

00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:30.276 A:middle
can fix those.

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:34.636 A:middle
So, the last thing I want to

00:16:34.636 --> 00:16:35.966 A:middle
talk to you about today, is

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:37.256 A:middle
measuring your build time.

00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:39.406 A:middle
We have two new pieces of

00:16:39.406 --> 00:16:40.666 A:middle
functionality in Xcode 10 for

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:40.976 A:middle
this.

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:45.026 A:middle
The first is we have introduced

00:16:45.126 --> 00:16:47.016 A:middle
in-line task times to give you

00:16:47.016 --> 00:16:48.226 A:middle
the duration that each of your

00:16:48.226 --> 00:16:49.586 A:middle
tasks has taken to run.

00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:52.796 A:middle
Now, I want to point out

00:16:52.796 --> 00:16:54.156 A:middle
something about your build logs.

00:16:54.586 --> 00:16:55.886 A:middle
There's a filter bar across the

00:16:55.886 --> 00:16:56.236 A:middle
top.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.956 A:middle
And specifically, the All the

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
Recent filters.
