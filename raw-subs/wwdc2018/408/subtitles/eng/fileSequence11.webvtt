00:10:58.276 --> 00:11:00.396 A:middle
or build graph even further by

00:11:00.396 --> 00:11:03.156 A:middle
allowing the Utilities target to

00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:04.716 A:middle
be built right after the Code

00:11:04.716 --> 00:11:06.146 A:middle
Gen target instead of having to

00:11:06.146 --> 00:11:07.196 A:middle
wait for all of the Physics

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:11.156 A:middle
target to be done.

00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:13.746 A:middle
Now, previously in Xcode, when

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:15.046 A:middle
you built targets that have a

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.396 A:middle
dependency on another target,

00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:18.326 A:middle
you have to wait for the

00:11:18.326 --> 00:11:19.646 A:middle
dependent target to finish its

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.236 A:middle
entire build process.

00:11:21.756 --> 00:11:23.096 A:middle
Well, we have a new feature in

00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:24.916 A:middle
Xcode 10 that allows us to

00:11:24.916 --> 00:11:27.046 A:middle
introduce some parallelism into

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:28.086 A:middle
your build for free.

00:11:28.596 --> 00:11:32.226 A:middle
And we do this by starting the

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.626 A:middle
compilation of your target as

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:36.596 A:middle
soon as the build phases that go

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.666 A:middle
into its dependencies that

00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:40.206 A:middle
satisfy our compilation are

00:11:40.206 --> 00:11:40.636 A:middle
complete.

00:11:41.696 --> 00:11:42.926 A:middle
So things like linking can now

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:43.746 A:middle
be done in parallel.

00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:47.486 A:middle
Now, if you have run script

00:11:47.486 --> 00:11:49.266 A:middle
phases, this is one of those

00:11:49.316 --> 00:11:50.896 A:middle
build phases that your target is

00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:53.216 A:middle
going to have to wait on to

00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:54.796 A:middle
finish in order before it can

00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:56.436 A:middle
start taking advantage of some

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:58.476 A:middle
of these new parallelization

00:11:58.476 --> 00:11:58.886 A:middle
benefits.

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:01.476 A:middle
So let's talk about run script
