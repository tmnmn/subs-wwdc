00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.086 A:middle
projects through the use of

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:00.736 A:middle
targets.

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:04.016 A:middle
And targets specify the output

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:04.976 A:middle
or the product that you would

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:05.566 A:middle
like to build.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.916 A:middle
Some examples are iOS app,

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:10.545 A:middle
framework, and unit tests.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.776 A:middle
Now, there's another piece of

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:13.846 A:middle
information, that's the

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.046 A:middle
dependency between these

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:15.696 A:middle
targets.

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:17.886 A:middle
And Xcode provides us two ways

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:19.526 A:middle
to define our dependencies.

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:21.556 A:middle
There's an explicit means, which

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:22.396 A:middle
we do through the target

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:23.436 A:middle
dependencies phase.

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:25.276 A:middle
And there's an implicit means,

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:26.586 A:middle
which is primarily done through

00:02:26.586 --> 00:02:28.116 A:middle
the linked binary with libraries

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:28.526 A:middle
phase.

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:29.806 A:middle
And we'll be taking a look at

00:02:29.806 --> 00:02:32.026 A:middle
those more in depth in just a

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:32.696 A:middle
few moments.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:34.546 A:middle
Now, throughout this section I

00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:35.956 A:middle
want to use a sample project to

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:36.996 A:middle
ground our discussion.

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:38.656 A:middle
And so we're going to take a

00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:40.006 A:middle
look at a dependency graph for

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:40.686 A:middle
that project.

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:43.736 A:middle
Now, a dependency graph is

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.416 A:middle
simply a listing of all of the

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.006 A:middle
targets.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:47.206 A:middle
And this case we're going to

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:48.236 A:middle
have five targets that we're

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:48.896 A:middle
going to be building.

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:51.336 A:middle
And it has that dependency

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:52.906 A:middle
information between those

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:53.466 A:middle
targets.

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:55.966 A:middle
And based on these two pieces of

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle
information Xcode can derive our

00:02:58.696 --> 00:02:59.226 A:middle
build order.

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:01.696 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at what
