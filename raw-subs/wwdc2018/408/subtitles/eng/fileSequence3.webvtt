00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:01.696 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at what

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:02.966 A:middle
this looks like on a timeline

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:03.246 A:middle
graph.

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:08.086 A:middle
So as we can see, each of these

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.486 A:middle
targets are building in in

00:03:09.486 --> 00:03:10.876 A:middle
order, sequentially.

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:12.796 A:middle
And they each have to wait until

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:13.946 A:middle
the previous target is done

00:03:13.946 --> 00:03:14.386 A:middle
building.

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:16.366 A:middle
Now, there's nothing wrong with

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:17.946 A:middle
this build timeline, per se.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:20.436 A:middle
But it does represent a waste of

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:22.026 A:middle
potential hardware utilization,

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:23.146 A:middle
especially if you have a

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.326 A:middle
multi-core or a mini-core

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.846 A:middle
machine like an iMac Pro.

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.356 A:middle
And what that means to you is a

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:29.616 A:middle
waste of time as a developer.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:32.416 A:middle
So instead, we want to move to

00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:34.466 A:middle
something that looks more like

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:37.576 A:middle
this.

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:38.846 A:middle
Now, there's a couple things --

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:39.876 A:middle
or a few things I want to note

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:40.456 A:middle
about this.

00:03:40.926 --> 00:03:42.726 A:middle
First, the amount of work that

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:43.936 A:middle
we actually did in building our

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.286 A:middle
project, it did not change.

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:48.806 A:middle
However, the time to build did

00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:49.456 A:middle
decrease.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:51.396 A:middle
And in this case, it actually

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:52.426 A:middle
decreased by a fairly

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:53.486 A:middle
significant margin.

00:03:53.946 --> 00:03:56.196 A:middle
And we were able to decrease our

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:57.666 A:middle
build time by making better

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:59.466 A:middle
utilization of the hardware that

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:02.736 A:middle
we have available to us.
