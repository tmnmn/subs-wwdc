00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:02.336 A:middle
Now, this target actually exists

00:07:02.336 --> 00:07:03.256 A:middle
in a different project.

00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:05.626 A:middle
And if you would like to make a

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:06.826 A:middle
reference to that project you

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.376 A:middle
can do so by dragging the

00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:10.266 A:middle
project as a child of the

00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:11.346 A:middle
current project you're working

00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:11.526 A:middle
in.

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.776 A:middle
So I want to walk through the

00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:14.806 A:middle
rest of the dependencies of our

00:07:14.806 --> 00:07:15.276 A:middle
project.

00:07:16.576 --> 00:07:17.916 A:middle
Our Shaders target has a

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:19.196 A:middle
dependency on our Utilities

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:19.506 A:middle
target.

00:07:20.886 --> 00:07:22.196 A:middle
Our Utilities target has a

00:07:22.196 --> 00:07:23.806 A:middle
dependency on our Physics

00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:24.106 A:middle
target.

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:27.206 A:middle
And lastly, our Tests have a

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:30.516 A:middle
dependency on our Shaders and

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.676 A:middle
our Utilities targets.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:33.206 A:middle
So now that we have an

00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:34.296 A:middle
understanding of the

00:07:34.296 --> 00:07:35.806 A:middle
configuration of our project,

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:37.266 A:middle
let's look at the steps that are

00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:38.996 A:middle
necessary to turn this

00:07:38.996 --> 00:07:41.106 A:middle
serialized build process into

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:43.106 A:middle
one that we can build more in

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:43.556 A:middle
parallel.

00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:45.286 A:middle
And we're going to start by

00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:46.136 A:middle
looking at our test

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:46.746 A:middle
dependencies.

00:07:48.876 --> 00:07:50.566 A:middle
Now, I've broken down the

00:07:50.566 --> 00:07:51.556 A:middle
dependencies into three

00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:52.366 A:middle
different classes of

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
dependencies that I want to talk

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:53.896 A:middle
about.

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:55.866 A:middle
This first dependency is the

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.366 A:middle
dependency that I call the "Do

00:07:57.366 --> 00:07:58.646 A:middle
Everything" dependency.

00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:00.566 A:middle
Right? It should a little bit
