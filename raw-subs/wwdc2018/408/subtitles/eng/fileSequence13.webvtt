00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:00.136 A:middle
files.

00:13:00.836 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
Now, these are very important

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:03.536 A:middle
for your run script phase.

00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:05.356 A:middle
As this is one of the key pieces

00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:07.126 A:middle
of information that the Xcode

00:13:07.126 --> 00:13:08.386 A:middle
Build System will use to

00:13:08.386 --> 00:13:09.606 A:middle
determine if your run scripts

00:13:09.606 --> 00:13:12.146 A:middle
should actually run or not.

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:13.946 A:middle
So this should include any file

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:15.986 A:middle
that your run script phase, the

00:13:16.026 --> 00:13:17.426 A:middle
script content, is actually

00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:18.986 A:middle
going to read or look at during

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:19.646 A:middle
its process.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:23.306 A:middle
Now, some of you may have a lot

00:13:23.876 --> 00:13:25.316 A:middle
of inputs into your run script

00:13:25.316 --> 00:13:25.676 A:middle
phase.

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:27.086 A:middle
And so this task might seem a

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:27.906 A:middle
little bit daunting.

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:31.046 A:middle
And so new in Xcode 10 we have

00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:32.666 A:middle
the ability for you -- or we've

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.776 A:middle
provided you the ability to

00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:34.966 A:middle
maintain this list in an

00:13:34.966 --> 00:13:37.426 A:middle
external file, something we call

00:13:37.426 --> 00:13:38.236 A:middle
a File List.

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:41.056 A:middle
Now, a file list is a simple

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:42.996 A:middle
text file that has all of its

00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:44.826 A:middle
inputs listed on its own line.

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:47.246 A:middle
You get access to all of the

00:13:47.246 --> 00:13:48.866 A:middle
same build settings that were

00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:49.946 A:middle
available to you throughout the

00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:51.026 A:middle
context of your run script

00:13:51.026 --> 00:13:51.456 A:middle
phase.

00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:53.806 A:middle
The important thing to note

00:13:53.806 --> 00:13:54.796 A:middle
here, though, is that these

00:13:54.796 --> 00:13:56.376 A:middle
files cannot be modified or

00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:57.606 A:middle
generated throughout your build

00:13:57.646 --> 00:13:58.306 A:middle
process.

00:13:58.766 --> 00:14:00.796 A:middle
They are read when your build
