00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:00.746 A:middle
build process where you define

00:06:00.746 --> 00:06:01.866 A:middle
all of the items that you would

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
like to link with your target.

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:06.046 A:middle
In this case I have two items.

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.346 A:middle
I have Physics and Utilities.

00:06:08.716 --> 00:06:11.526 A:middle
Now, these are targets within

00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:12.856 A:middle
our project and our workspace.

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:14.696 A:middle
So Xcode can create an implicit

00:06:14.696 --> 00:06:16.716 A:middle
dependency on those targets.

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:19.356 A:middle
If you're using other linking

00:06:19.356 --> 00:06:22.156 A:middle
features such as Autolink or the

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:23.756 A:middle
other LD Build Flags build

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.416 A:middle
setting, those are not going to

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:27.256 A:middle
be made available to you here

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:27.846 A:middle
implicitly.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.236 A:middle
So you either have to make an

00:06:29.236 --> 00:06:30.636 A:middle
explicit dependency in this

00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:33.756 A:middle
build phase, or in the Target

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:34.996 A:middle
Dependencies build phase.

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.806 A:middle
So you can see here that we have

00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:38.686 A:middle
another item here called

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:39.206 A:middle
Shaders.

00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:42.106 A:middle
And Shaders is something that is

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:43.926 A:middle
not used at link time, but

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:45.776 A:middle
instead it's used by another

00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:47.126 A:middle
build phase within our current

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:47.456 A:middle
target.

00:06:48.096 --> 00:06:49.316 A:middle
So it's important that we let

00:06:49.316 --> 00:06:50.926 A:middle
Xcode know that this is a

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:52.256 A:middle
dependency and that we need to

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:54.506 A:middle
wait for the Shaders to finish

00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:57.046 A:middle
its compilation and build before

00:06:57.046 --> 00:06:57.886 A:middle
we can actually build the

00:06:57.886 --> 00:06:58.876 A:middle
current target we're on.

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:02.336 A:middle
Now, this target actually exists
