00:25:59.756 --> 00:26:00.986 A:middle
throughout your project and the

00:26:00.986 --> 00:26:03.516 A:middle
frameworks you import and assume

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:04.576 A:middle
that they might be the one

00:26:04.576 --> 00:26:05.746 A:middle
that's going to be used.

00:26:06.756 --> 00:26:08.316 A:middle
It has to do this because if

00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:09.706 A:middle
none of them match, it needs to

00:26:09.706 --> 00:26:10.776 A:middle
present you with an error.

00:26:12.586 --> 00:26:14.966 A:middle
So instead, we can do something

00:26:14.966 --> 00:26:16.706 A:middle
much better and much more,

00:26:16.706 --> 00:26:18.616 A:middle
again, declarative of our

00:26:18.616 --> 00:26:19.106 A:middle
intent.

00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:21.096 A:middle
We can define a protocol.

00:26:21.866 --> 00:26:22.696 A:middle
Now, this can be done in the

00:26:22.696 --> 00:26:24.876 A:middle
same file, or a different file,

00:26:25.426 --> 00:26:27.236 A:middle
but the important part is that

00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:28.616 A:middle
once we change this delegate

00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:30.546 A:middle
property to use our protocol

00:26:30.626 --> 00:26:32.756 A:middle
instead of Any Object, the

00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:34.806 A:middle
compiler knows exactly which

00:26:34.806 --> 00:26:35.826 A:middle
method it's calling.

00:26:37.186 --> 00:26:38.276 A:middle
And now you also have the

00:26:38.276 --> 00:26:39.546 A:middle
opportunity for all of your

00:26:39.546 --> 00:26:41.846 A:middle
implementing types to be checked

00:26:42.026 --> 00:26:43.336 A:middle
that they implement the method

00:26:43.386 --> 00:26:43.866 A:middle
correctly.

00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:48.186 A:middle
So, we've talked about several

00:26:48.186 --> 00:26:50.576 A:middle
techniques here for decreasing

00:26:50.576 --> 00:26:51.856 A:middle
the amount of work the compiler

00:26:51.856 --> 00:26:53.816 A:middle
does once it's already decided

00:26:53.816 --> 00:26:55.136 A:middle
to recompile a file.

00:26:56.106 --> 00:26:58.486 A:middle
But what about not recompiling

00:26:58.486 --> 00:26:59.556 A:middle
the file at all?

00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.696 A:middle
What makes the compiler choose
