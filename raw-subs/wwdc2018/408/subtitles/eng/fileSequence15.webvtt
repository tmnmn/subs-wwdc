00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:01.116 A:middle
run script phase to give you the

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:03.126 A:middle
opportunity to generate those

00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:04.606 A:middle
missing output files.

00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:08.446 A:middle
Now also new in Xcode 10, we

00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:10.466 A:middle
have documentation for the run

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:11.396 A:middle
script phases.

00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:16.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.746 A:middle
So, it goes through more detail

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:19.966 A:middle
of what I just explained and it

00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:20.726 A:middle
tells you about all of the

00:15:20.726 --> 00:15:21.886 A:middle
additional build settings that

00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:22.956 A:middle
are made available to you,

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.546 A:middle
including how you can use those

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.146 A:middle
file lists within your own

00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:26.906 A:middle
script content.

00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:29.636 A:middle
Now, when setting up your run

00:15:29.636 --> 00:15:30.896 A:middle
script phases and declaring all

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.166 A:middle
of these new dependencies, and

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:34.046 A:middle
including when you modify the

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.316 A:middle
dependencies in your targets,

00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:37.596 A:middle
you may run into a dependency

00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:37.986 A:middle
cycle.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:40.386 A:middle
And a dependency cycle is simply

00:15:40.516 --> 00:15:42.036 A:middle
an interdependency graph

00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:43.226 A:middle
somewhere there is a loop that's

00:15:43.226 --> 00:15:43.706 A:middle
created.

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:46.346 A:middle
Well, new in Xcode 10 we have

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:48.586 A:middle
better diagnostics to detect

00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:49.836 A:middle
these cycles and will give you

00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:51.546 A:middle
an error, including the ability

00:15:51.546 --> 00:15:53.046 A:middle
for you to expand this box to

00:15:53.046 --> 00:15:54.406 A:middle
get all of the inputs that the

00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:56.076 A:middle
Xcode build system knows that

00:15:56.076 --> 00:15:57.516 A:middle
went into creating the cycle.

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.016 A:middle
So, cycles are bad for a couple
