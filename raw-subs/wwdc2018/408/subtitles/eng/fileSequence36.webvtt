00:35:59.186 --> 00:36:01.176 A:middle
default mode where the OB-C

00:36:01.176 --> 00:36:02.866 A:middle
attribute will only be inferred

00:36:03.566 --> 00:36:05.316 A:middle
for methods and properties that

00:36:05.316 --> 00:36:08.176 A:middle
satisfy protocol requirements or

00:36:08.176 --> 00:36:09.716 A:middle
those that override methods that

00:36:09.716 --> 00:36:10.806 A:middle
come from Objective-C.

00:36:11.306 --> 00:36:14.576 A:middle
So we've talked a lot about the

00:36:14.576 --> 00:36:15.856 A:middle
generated header and what you

00:36:15.856 --> 00:36:17.026 A:middle
can do to your Swift code.

00:36:17.416 --> 00:36:19.306 A:middle
But you have Objective-C code as

00:36:19.306 --> 00:36:19.816 A:middle
well.

00:36:20.066 --> 00:36:21.386 A:middle
And the Objective-C code,

00:36:21.386 --> 00:36:23.596 A:middle
likewise, causes rebuilds.

00:36:24.656 --> 00:36:25.846 A:middle
And so a bridging header looks

00:36:25.846 --> 00:36:27.186 A:middle
something like this, usually.

00:36:27.186 --> 00:36:28.556 A:middle
It's got a bunch of other

00:36:28.556 --> 00:36:29.996 A:middle
headers in the project that

00:36:29.996 --> 00:36:30.976 A:middle
you're trying to expose to

00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:31.386 A:middle
Swift.

00:36:32.616 --> 00:36:34.016 A:middle
And we can zoom in on one of

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:34.886 A:middle
these headers here, the

00:36:34.886 --> 00:36:37.436 A:middle
MyViewController header and see

00:36:37.436 --> 00:36:38.716 A:middle
that it's a perfectly normal

00:36:38.716 --> 00:36:39.526 A:middle
declaration of a view

00:36:39.526 --> 00:36:40.086 A:middle
controller.

00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:42.476 A:middle
But also that it itself includes

00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:43.196 A:middle
another header.

00:36:44.376 --> 00:36:46.006 A:middle
What that means is that if any

00:36:46.006 --> 00:36:48.126 A:middle
of these headers change, the

00:36:48.126 --> 00:36:49.886 A:middle
Swift code in your target has to

00:36:49.886 --> 00:36:51.866 A:middle
be recompiled because it might

00:36:51.866 --> 00:36:52.856 A:middle
depend on something that

00:36:52.856 --> 00:36:53.356 A:middle
changed.

00:36:54.616 --> 00:36:56.206 A:middle
This is suboptimal.

00:36:56.466 --> 00:36:59.886 A:middle
And now we can notice that in

00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:01.656 A:middle
this example, the only reason
