00:21:59.696 --> 00:22:01.256 A:middle
complicated expression involving

00:22:01.256 --> 00:22:03.236 A:middle
reduced and the power function

00:22:03.236 --> 00:22:06.586 A:middle
from the system frameworks, you

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:08.026 A:middle
might not have even guessed that

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.566 A:middle
"double" was inferred type of

00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:10.296 A:middle
this property.

00:22:11.066 --> 00:22:12.126 A:middle
And so by providing this

00:22:12.126 --> 00:22:14.076 A:middle
information here, you've saved

00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:15.406 A:middle
work that the compiler would

00:22:15.406 --> 00:22:17.796 A:middle
have to do in every file that

00:22:17.826 --> 00:22:18.876 A:middle
uses this struct.

00:22:19.626 --> 00:22:21.636 A:middle
And you've also saved work that

00:22:21.636 --> 00:22:23.046 A:middle
your coworkers would have to do

00:22:23.336 --> 00:22:25.086 A:middle
to figure out what really is the

00:22:25.086 --> 00:22:26.086 A:middle
type of that big number

00:22:26.086 --> 00:22:26.576 A:middle
property.

00:22:27.156 --> 00:22:30.166 A:middle
So a lot of times you can get

00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:31.226 A:middle
this extra key piece of

00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:32.596 A:middle
information that will help your

00:22:32.596 --> 00:22:34.786 A:middle
build times is also an example

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:36.036 A:middle
of a good software engineering

00:22:36.036 --> 00:22:36.666 A:middle
practice.

00:22:37.806 --> 00:22:38.846 A:middle
Let's take a look at another

00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:40.516 A:middle
example involving closures.

00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:43.286 A:middle
This time I'm trying to define a

00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:44.936 A:middle
function that will return the

00:22:44.936 --> 00:22:47.156 A:middle
sum of the non-optional values

00:22:47.156 --> 00:22:48.186 A:middle
of its arguments.

00:22:48.926 --> 00:22:50.156 A:middle
And if all three arguments are

00:22:50.156 --> 00:22:51.826 A:middle
nil, it will return nil.

00:22:53.136 --> 00:22:54.696 A:middle
And I'm trying to use one of

00:22:54.696 --> 00:22:56.726 A:middle
Swift's cool features where if

00:22:56.726 --> 00:22:58.526 A:middle
you have a closure with a single

00:22:58.526 --> 00:23:00.646 A:middle
expression in its body, then the
