00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:01.476 A:middle
So let's talk about run script

00:12:01.476 --> 00:12:01.976 A:middle
phases.

00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:04.116 A:middle
Run script phases allow you to

00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:05.636 A:middle
customize your build process to

00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:06.496 A:middle
meet your needs.

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:08.436 A:middle
And so with this flexibility

00:12:08.826 --> 00:12:10.436 A:middle
comes some responsibility for

00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:11.906 A:middle
you as a developer as well.

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:13.206 A:middle
And so we want to walk you

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:14.266 A:middle
through the configuration

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:15.856 A:middle
process and make sure that you

00:12:15.856 --> 00:12:17.196 A:middle
have your run script phases set

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:18.866 A:middle
up and configured well so that

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:19.856 A:middle
your builds behave.

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.446 A:middle
Now, this is your Script Phase

00:12:24.446 --> 00:12:24.786 A:middle
Editor.

00:12:25.226 --> 00:12:26.566 A:middle
It can also be found within your

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:27.356 A:middle
Build Phase Editor.

00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:28.766 A:middle
Now I want to call your

00:12:28.766 --> 00:12:31.406 A:middle
attention to first the script

00:12:31.696 --> 00:12:32.176 A:middle
body here.

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:33.916 A:middle
You can either put your entire

00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:34.916 A:middle
script contents here.

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.176 A:middle
Or you can do what I've done and

00:12:36.176 --> 00:12:37.456 A:middle
reference another script that's

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:38.286 A:middle
within your project.

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:40.876 A:middle
Now, throughout the entirety of

00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:42.806 A:middle
your run script phase, there are

00:12:42.806 --> 00:12:43.996 A:middle
a set of build settings that are

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:44.746 A:middle
available to you.

00:12:44.906 --> 00:12:45.926 A:middle
And I'm making use of one of

00:12:45.926 --> 00:12:47.266 A:middle
those right now, which is the

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:47.746 A:middle
source group.

00:12:48.956 --> 00:12:50.506 A:middle
This gives you a convenient way

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:52.646 A:middle
to not have to provide absolute

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.336 A:middle
paths or try to do some relative

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:55.956 A:middle
path hacks to get your stuff to

00:12:55.956 --> 00:12:56.116 A:middle
work.

00:12:57.436 --> 00:12:59.676 A:middle
The next section are you input

00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:00.136 A:middle
files.
