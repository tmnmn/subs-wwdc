00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:01.076 A:middle
To Current Swift Syntax.

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:04.126 A:middle
However, when you do this

00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:06.906 A:middle
migration, you may have actually

00:35:06.906 --> 00:35:09.936 A:middle
selected to keep the Swift 3

00:35:09.936 --> 00:35:11.446 A:middle
compatibility mode for a

00:35:11.446 --> 00:35:12.576 A:middle
particular build setting.

00:35:12.696 --> 00:35:14.776 A:middle
And that's the Swift 3 @objc

00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:15.406 A:middle
imprints.

00:35:16.196 --> 00:35:17.086 A:middle
This is an option when you

00:35:17.086 --> 00:35:19.316 A:middle
migrate to Swift 4 to keep on a

00:35:19.316 --> 00:35:22.176 A:middle
rule from Swift 3 which exposes

00:35:22.176 --> 00:35:23.686 A:middle
internal methods and properties

00:35:23.736 --> 00:35:26.416 A:middle
to Objective-C automatically on

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:30.096 A:middle
any subclass of NS Object.

00:35:30.236 --> 00:35:31.626 A:middle
Now, if you are writing in Swift

00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:33.416 A:middle
3, you may be relying on this

00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:33.846 A:middle
feature.

00:35:34.196 --> 00:35:35.936 A:middle
But there's a lot of cases where

00:35:36.086 --> 00:35:37.626 A:middle
you were not actually depending

00:35:37.626 --> 00:35:38.806 A:middle
on this in any way.

00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:40.586 A:middle
Not in the runtime sense.

00:35:40.746 --> 00:35:42.226 A:middle
And definitely not at compile

00:35:42.226 --> 00:35:42.616 A:middle
time.

00:35:43.666 --> 00:35:45.466 A:middle
So, once you get to the point

00:35:45.816 --> 00:35:47.256 A:middle
where you've explicitly marked

00:35:47.256 --> 00:35:48.176 A:middle
all of your Objective-C

00:35:48.176 --> 00:35:51.506 A:middle
dependencies as either @objc or

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:54.116 A:middle
IBOutlet, IBAction, whatever, as

00:35:54.116 --> 00:35:56.096 A:middle
appropriate, then you can also

00:35:56.096 --> 00:35:57.826 A:middle
select this build setting and

00:35:57.826 --> 00:35:59.186 A:middle
hit Delete to get it back to the

00:35:59.186 --> 00:36:01.176 A:middle
default mode where the OB-C
