00:24:59.686 --> 00:25:01.226 A:middle
And it compiles in a quick,

00:25:01.296 --> 00:25:02.596 A:middle
reasonable amount of time.

00:25:03.106 --> 00:25:06.336 A:middle
Now, the last example I'm going

00:25:06.336 --> 00:25:07.856 A:middle
to show in this section is

00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:09.236 A:middle
something that won't apply quite

00:25:09.236 --> 00:25:10.786 A:middle
as broadly as the previous two.

00:25:11.396 --> 00:25:13.256 A:middle
It's about this type Any Object.

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:17.516 A:middle
Now, Any Object is a convenient

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.026 A:middle
type that describes any class

00:25:20.026 --> 00:25:20.646 A:middle
instance.

00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:22.226 A:middle
So not a struct or an enum.

00:25:22.326 --> 00:25:23.416 A:middle
Definitely a class.

00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:24.666 A:middle
But we don't know which one.

00:25:25.726 --> 00:25:27.076 A:middle
But it also has an additional

00:25:27.076 --> 00:25:28.736 A:middle
feature carried over from

00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:30.376 A:middle
Objective-C's ID type.

00:25:31.206 --> 00:25:33.146 A:middle
And that's this method call

00:25:33.146 --> 00:25:33.886 A:middle
syntax.

00:25:34.106 --> 00:25:36.066 A:middle
If you try to call a method or

00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:38.096 A:middle
access a property on a value of

00:25:38.156 --> 00:25:40.936 A:middle
type Any Object, Swift will

00:25:40.936 --> 00:25:42.816 A:middle
allow you to do so, as long as

00:25:42.816 --> 00:25:45.146 A:middle
that method is visible somewhere

00:25:45.146 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
in your project and exposed to

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:48.416 A:middle
the Objective-C runtime.

00:25:49.416 --> 00:25:50.956 A:middle
However, this does come at a

00:25:50.956 --> 00:25:51.576 A:middle
cost.

00:25:52.346 --> 00:25:53.976 A:middle
Because the compiler doesn't

00:25:53.976 --> 00:25:55.306 A:middle
know which method you're going

00:25:55.306 --> 00:25:57.616 A:middle
to call, it has to go search out

00:25:57.616 --> 00:25:59.516 A:middle
any possible implementations

00:25:59.756 --> 00:26:00.986 A:middle
throughout your project and the
