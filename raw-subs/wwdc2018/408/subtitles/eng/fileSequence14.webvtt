00:13:58.766 --> 00:14:00.796 A:middle
They are read when your build

00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:01.666 A:middle
process starts.

00:14:02.086 --> 00:14:03.376 A:middle
And all that information is used

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:03.576 A:middle
then.

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:07.216 A:middle
Next I want to talk to you about

00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:08.266 A:middle
your output files.

00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:09.596 A:middle
Your output files are another

00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:10.886 A:middle
key piece of information that's

00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:11.816 A:middle
used throughout your build

00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:12.396 A:middle
process.

00:14:13.016 --> 00:14:14.086 A:middle
And Xcode will use this

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.926 A:middle
information to determine if your

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:17.436 A:middle
run script phase actually needs

00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:17.786 A:middle
to run.

00:14:17.886 --> 00:14:20.616 A:middle
And of course, we have support

00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:23.026 A:middle
for output files -- or file

00:14:23.026 --> 00:14:24.166 A:middle
lists for your output files as

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:24.376 A:middle
well.

00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:27.066 A:middle
So I want to recap for you when

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.186 A:middle
your run script phase is

00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:28.726 A:middle
actually run.

00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:31.186 A:middle
If you have no input files

00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:33.896 A:middle
declared, the Xcode build system

00:14:34.076 --> 00:14:35.186 A:middle
will need to run to your run

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:36.566 A:middle
script phase on every single

00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:36.896 A:middle
build.

00:14:37.556 --> 00:14:38.936 A:middle
So this is one of key reasons

00:14:38.936 --> 00:14:40.106 A:middle
it's important to declare your

00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:40.626 A:middle
inputs.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.476 A:middle
Now if any of your input files

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:45.396 A:middle
change, including the contents

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:47.996 A:middle
of your file lists or any of the

00:14:47.996 --> 00:14:49.506 A:middle
inputs that the file lists point

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
to, Xcode will know that it

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:52.596 A:middle
needs to rerun your run script

00:14:52.596 --> 00:14:53.196 A:middle
phase for you.

00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:56.216 A:middle
And finally, if any of your

00:14:56.216 --> 00:14:58.426 A:middle
output files are missing, the

00:14:58.426 --> 00:14:59.876 A:middle
Xcode build system will run your

00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:01.116 A:middle
run script phase to give you the
