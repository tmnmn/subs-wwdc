00:38:00.476 --> 00:38:01.566 A:middle
And there's one more note.

00:38:02.636 --> 00:38:04.206 A:middle
This file here that I defined,

00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:06.626 A:middle
well, it's possible that nothing

00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:08.256 A:middle
else in my Objective-C code

00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:09.586 A:middle
needs to access this property,

00:38:09.656 --> 00:38:09.966 A:middle
either.

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:12.796 A:middle
In which case, there's no need

00:38:12.796 --> 00:38:13.786 A:middle
for a separate file.

00:38:14.266 --> 00:38:16.256 A:middle
I can put this category directly

00:38:16.256 --> 00:38:17.176 A:middle
into my .m.

00:38:18.356 --> 00:38:19.676 A:middle
There's nothing wrong with doing

00:38:19.676 --> 00:38:19.946 A:middle
this.

00:38:20.056 --> 00:38:21.316 A:middle
Everything will work fine.

00:38:21.646 --> 00:38:23.076 A:middle
And as I said before, property

00:38:23.076 --> 00:38:24.736 A:middle
synthesis will still work for

00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:26.046 A:middle
the network manager property.

00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:28.976 A:middle
So what have we seen?

00:38:29.946 --> 00:38:32.636 A:middle
We used private and block-based

00:38:32.636 --> 00:38:34.456 A:middle
API's, and turning off that

00:38:34.456 --> 00:38:35.906 A:middle
Build setting to shrink the

00:38:35.906 --> 00:38:37.276 A:middle
contents of the generated

00:38:37.276 --> 00:38:37.586 A:middle
header.

00:38:38.786 --> 00:38:40.826 A:middle
And, we've broken out separate

00:38:40.826 --> 00:38:42.736 A:middle
contents from the Objective-C

00:38:42.736 --> 00:38:44.266 A:middle
headers that we declared, which

00:38:44.266 --> 00:38:45.536 A:middle
shrink the contents of the

00:38:45.576 --> 00:38:46.306 A:middle
bridging header.

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:49.076 A:middle
Less content means less work

00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:49.996 A:middle
done on each build.

00:38:50.336 --> 00:38:51.856 A:middle
And it also means fewer

00:38:51.856 --> 00:38:53.916 A:middle
opportunities for changes, which

00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:55.406 A:middle
means fewer chances for

00:38:55.406 --> 00:38:56.026 A:middle
rebuilds.

00:38:56.686 --> 00:38:57.936 A:middle
We win on both counts.

00:38:59.126 --> 00:39:01.066 A:middle
So let's wrap things up.
