00:10:00.186 --> 00:10:01.476 A:middle
So we were able to shrink our

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.426 A:middle
utilities target down because we

00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:05.346 A:middle
moved that work into Code Gen.

00:10:06.076 --> 00:10:07.426 A:middle
And since Code Gen has no other

00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:09.336 A:middle
dependencies, it can move to the

00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:11.176 A:middle
very front of our build process.

00:10:11.506 --> 00:10:13.056 A:middle
It can also be built in parallel

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:14.516 A:middle
with our Physics target, which

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:15.686 A:middle
is the red box on the bottom.

00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:18.756 A:middle
And lastly, because Shaders no

00:10:18.756 --> 00:10:20.436 A:middle
longer depends on Utilities, it

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:21.616 A:middle
doesn't have to wait for both

00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:24.686 A:middle
Utilities and the Physics target

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:25.396 A:middle
to be built.

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:26.896 A:middle
And instead it can be built as

00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:29.046 A:middle
soon as that Code Gen target is

00:10:30.456 --> 00:10:30.566 A:middle
done.

00:10:30.766 --> 00:10:31.986 A:middle
Now, the last dependency I want

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:33.476 A:middle
to talk to you about are the

00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:34.926 A:middle
ones that I call the "Forgotten

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:35.336 A:middle
Ones."

00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:37.906 A:middle
Throughout the evolution or the

00:10:37.906 --> 00:10:40.376 A:middle
lifecycle of our products and

00:10:40.376 --> 00:10:42.956 A:middle
our code, we tend to move code

00:10:42.956 --> 00:10:44.106 A:middle
around and delete things.

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:45.046 A:middle
And we get things like dead

00:10:45.096 --> 00:10:45.356 A:middle
code.

00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:47.056 A:middle
Well, we get the same thing that

00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:48.326 A:middle
happens with our dependencies.

00:10:48.706 --> 00:10:49.816 A:middle
Sometimes we simply forget to

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.376 A:middle
clean them up.

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:52.506 A:middle
And so in these cases, it's

00:10:52.926 --> 00:10:54.306 A:middle
actually safe to just remove

00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:54.976 A:middle
that dependency.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:58.276 A:middle
And this last change tightens up

00:10:58.276 --> 00:11:00.396 A:middle
or build graph even further by
