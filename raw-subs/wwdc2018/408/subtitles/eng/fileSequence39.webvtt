00:38:59.126 --> 00:39:01.066 A:middle
So let's wrap things up.

00:39:02.316 --> 00:39:04.646 A:middle
David and I talked a lot about

00:39:04.946 --> 00:39:06.486 A:middle
quite a few different topics, of

00:39:06.486 --> 00:39:07.556 A:middle
ways that you can get more

00:39:07.556 --> 00:39:09.186 A:middle
information from Xcode and that

00:39:09.186 --> 00:39:10.906 A:middle
you can provide more information

00:39:11.196 --> 00:39:13.596 A:middle
to Xcode in ways that can speed

00:39:13.596 --> 00:39:14.256 A:middle
up your builds.

00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:16.266 A:middle
And this covers both increasing

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:17.366 A:middle
the build efficiency when you're

00:39:17.366 --> 00:39:19.426 A:middle
doing a build and reducing the

00:39:19.426 --> 00:39:21.116 A:middle
work that you have to do at all

00:39:21.256 --> 00:39:21.956 A:middle
in a rebuild.

00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:25.266 A:middle
So, we went through this kind of

00:39:25.266 --> 00:39:25.436 A:middle
fast.

00:39:25.616 --> 00:39:26.816 A:middle
So if you want to see it again,

00:39:26.816 --> 00:39:27.956 A:middle
check out the video page.

00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:29.486 A:middle
And you can also come find us in

00:39:29.486 --> 00:39:31.746 A:middle
the labs at noon today and

00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:33.326 A:middle
tomorrow in the afternoon.

00:39:33.326 --> 00:39:33.936 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:39:34.086 --> 00:39:35.336 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of the

00:39:35.336 --> 00:39:36.426 A:middle
conference.
