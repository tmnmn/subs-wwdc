00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:00.696 A:middle
And specifically, you'll need to

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
look at the Build Action.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.046 A:middle
And in there, the Build Options.

00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:06.866 A:middle
Now, there are two listed here.

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.866 A:middle
The first is Parallelize Build.

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:10.916 A:middle
And the second is Find Implicit

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:11.656 A:middle
Dependencies.

00:05:12.426 --> 00:05:13.856 A:middle
You'll want to check Parallelize

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:14.146 A:middle
Build.

00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:16.176 A:middle
This will allow Xcode to use the

00:05:16.176 --> 00:05:17.656 A:middle
dependency information across

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:19.296 A:middle
your targets so that it can

00:05:19.296 --> 00:05:20.846 A:middle
attempt to build your targets in

00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:21.376 A:middle
parallel.

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:24.646 A:middle
So let's look at how your

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:25.996 A:middle
dependencies are actually

00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:27.116 A:middle
configured within Xcode.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.406 A:middle
This is done through the Build

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:30.036 A:middle
Phase Editor.

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:31.496 A:middle
And you can get to the Build

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:33.616 A:middle
Phase Editor by going to your

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:35.566 A:middle
Project Navigator and selecting

00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:36.116 A:middle
your project.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:37.806 A:middle
In this case we're looking at

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:39.556 A:middle
the Game Target -- or the Game

00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:39.916 A:middle
Project.

00:05:40.326 --> 00:05:43.296 A:middle
Next, you want to click on Build

00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:43.816 A:middle
Phases.

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.036 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:05:46.036 --> 00:05:46.626 A:middle
Game Target.

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:47.946 A:middle
This is the Build Phase Editor

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:48.806 A:middle
for our Game Target.

00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:50.156 A:middle
And we're going to look at how

00:05:50.156 --> 00:05:51.536 A:middle
its dependencies are configured.

00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:52.826 A:middle
And I want to call your

00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:54.916 A:middle
attention first to the Link

00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:57.166 A:middle
Binary with Libraries phase.

00:05:57.836 --> 00:05:59.446 A:middle
Now, this is the phase of your

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:00.746 A:middle
build process where you define
