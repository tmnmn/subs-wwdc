00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.356 A:middle
First you make your utterance

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:01.406 A:middle
and then you set the voice

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:02.506 A:middle
property using

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:03.886 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.286 A:middle
As an example of using the

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.296 A:middle
identifier initializer, you

00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:10.896 A:middle
could get all the speech voices

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:13.266 A:middle
which is an array of speech

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:15.116 A:middle
voice objects and then choose

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.546 A:middle
the first one, for example, and

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:17.626 A:middle
then pass in the identifier

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:18.126 A:middle
property.

00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:22.136 A:middle
Here are some of the languages

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.166 A:middle
that are supported on iOS by

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:24.476 A:middle
default.

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:30.136 A:middle
Now let's talk about some of the

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:31.096 A:middle
properties that you can use on

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.116 A:middle
AVSpeechSynthesizer.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:34.096 A:middle
Speech rate can be controlled

00:05:34.526 --> 00:05:36.336 A:middle
using the rate property, and it

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.406 A:middle
goes from 0 to 1.

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.856 A:middle
Now this will scale speech to go

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:42.496 A:middle
slower or faster.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
Speech will be scaled from about

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:47.686 A:middle
0 to 1 with values from 0 to .5.

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:50.206 A:middle
So that means if you pass in .5,

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.776 A:middle
you will get the default normal

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:52.396 A:middle
speaking rate.

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.606 A:middle
If you want to go faster, you

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.066 A:middle
can pass in values from .5 to 1

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.806 A:middle
and that will scale speech from

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.296 A:middle
normal speaking rates at 1x all
