willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.186 A:middle
which will give you back an

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.636 A:middle
NSRange which then you can

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
convert into a string range to

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.306 A:middle
use that in your string.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:12.606 A:middle
Now a little demo.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, my friends.

00:04:17.426 --> 00:04:18.976 A:middle
I'm inside the iPhone.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Those are the basics

00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:26.226 A:middle
of AVSpeechSynthesis and, as you

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.796 A:middle
can see, it's very simple to get

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:28.386 A:middle
off the ground.

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.766 A:middle
The next topic is how do you

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:31.746 A:middle
choose a right voice?

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:33.236 A:middle
There are many built-in voices,

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:34.716 A:middle
one for each supported language.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.516 A:middle
Something to note is Siri voices

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.146 A:middle
are not available through this

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:39.446 A:middle
API.

00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:42.356 A:middle
Users can, however, download

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.766 A:middle
higher-quality voices.

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:44.716 A:middle
And when those are downloaded,

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.286 A:middle
they will appear in the list of

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:46.856 A:middle
voices.

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:50.846 A:middle
So you can select a voice using

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.176 A:middle
either an identifier or a

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:52.706 A:middle
language.

00:04:53.246 --> 00:04:54.386 A:middle
If you select a voice by

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:55.486 A:middle
language, it will select the

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.606 A:middle
user's default voice.

00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:58.736 A:middle
So how do we do that?

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.356 A:middle
First you make your utterance
