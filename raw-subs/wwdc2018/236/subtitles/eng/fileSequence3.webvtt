00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.086 A:middle
use the duckOthers option.

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:04.436 A:middle
Another note is that the audio

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.706 A:middle
session will not be set to

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.436 A:middle
inactive after speech is done.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:10.146 A:middle
That's because it's a shared

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.026 A:middle
session only so that if there is

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.436 A:middle
any other audio playing at the

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:14.756 A:middle
same time, we would not want to

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:15.336 A:middle
stop that.

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:17.576 A:middle
So if you want to set the audio

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:18.826 A:middle
session to inactive, you would

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:19.566 A:middle
do that yourself.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.386 A:middle
There are some callback methods

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.736 A:middle
available in AVSpeechSynthesis

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.386 A:middle
that will help inform about the

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:27.716 A:middle
life cycle of an utterance.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.036 A:middle
These are optional methods in

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:31.016 A:middle
the synthesizer delegate

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:31.516 A:middle
protocol.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.656 A:middle
For example, you can know when

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:36.116 A:middle
speech starts, speech finishes,

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:37.946 A:middle
even the character ranges that

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:38.746 A:middle
will be spoken.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:40.506 A:middle
You can also know when speech is

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.676 A:middle
paused or continued.

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
So an example of this in code

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:47.226 A:middle
snippet form, you can set your

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.036 A:middle
synthesizer delegate to an

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:50.586 A:middle
object and then implement these

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.926 A:middle
methods, for example the

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
didStart in which case you'll

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:55.886 A:middle
get the utterance back, the

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:58.586 A:middle
didFinish which will do the

00:03:58.586 --> 00:03:59.976 A:middle
appropriate thing, and then the

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString
