00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.306 A:middle
education app where having

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:02.246 A:middle
synthesized speech provides a

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:03.596 A:middle
good reinforcement for learning

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.215 A:middle
materials.

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.236 A:middle
One example, providing audio

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:08.866 A:middle
updates during a workout can be

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.596 A:middle
communicated effectively using

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:11.496 A:middle
synthesized speech.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.996 A:middle
A note about synthesis and

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.026 A:middle
accessibility.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.286 A:middle
So speech synthesis is a

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.816 A:middle
powerful tool for helping many

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.586 A:middle
users with many disabilities.

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:23.956 A:middle
For example, cognitive users can

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.806 A:middle
get reinforcement about the

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:27.336 A:middle
output that they are

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:28.046 A:middle
experiencing.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:29.776 A:middle
Users who have trouble

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:31.386 A:middle
vocalizing speech can use

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:33.046 A:middle
synthesis to generate speech for

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:33.336 A:middle
them.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.206 A:middle
Non-sighted users use speech

00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:37.566 A:middle
synthesis to consume their

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.336 A:middle
interfaces.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.076 A:middle
However, it's important to note

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.376 A:middle
that it is not a replacement for

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:43.946 A:middle
VoiceOver or other screen reader

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
technologies.

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:46.656 A:middle
For example, speech can overlap

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:47.796 A:middle
with what VoiceOver is speaking

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:48.576 A:middle
at the same time.

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.846 A:middle
And most of the speech won't be

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.626 A:middle
available to any devices that

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.926 A:middle
are connected such as a Braille

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:54.366 A:middle
device.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:56.816 A:middle
Instead, you should make your

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.026 A:middle
app accessible using the

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
UIAccessibility API.
