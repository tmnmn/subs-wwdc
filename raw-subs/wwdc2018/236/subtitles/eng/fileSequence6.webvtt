00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.296 A:middle
normal speaking rates at 1x all

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
the way up to 4x.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.666 A:middle
To do that, you can create a

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:05.926 A:middle
speech utterance and then set

00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:09.056 A:middle
the rate to a float value or you

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:10.366 A:middle
can use some of these constants

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:12.956 A:middle
which are default rate maximum

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:13.526 A:middle
or minimum.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.496 A:middle
Let's talk about pitch and

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:16.836 A:middle
volume.

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:18.316 A:middle
These are also properties you

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.446 A:middle
set on the speech utterance.

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:21.386 A:middle
Pitch controls how high the

00:06:21.386 --> 00:06:23.076 A:middle
voice is or how low.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.046 A:middle
Volume controls the volume of

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:25.986 A:middle
the voice itself.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.496 A:middle
So, for example, we can set

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.146 A:middle
pitch to a very high pitch voice

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:31.786 A:middle
using a one value.

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:33.706 A:middle
We can set volume to a lower

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:35.286 A:middle
volume using .25.

00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:37.116 A:middle
Note that lowering the speech

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.086 A:middle
volume does not affect the

00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:38.996 A:middle
system volume.

00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:43.466 A:middle
Finally, let's talk about

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:44.616 A:middle
attributed strings.

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:46.936 A:middle
Attributed strings allow us to

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:48.716 A:middle
customize how speech sounds

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:49.866 A:middle
using different attributes.

00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.136 A:middle
One available attribute that I'd

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:53.896 A:middle
like to discuss is IPA notation.

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:55.636 A:middle
IPA stands for International

00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.256 A:middle
Phonetic Alphabet, and it allows

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.796 A:middle
us to customize how specialized
