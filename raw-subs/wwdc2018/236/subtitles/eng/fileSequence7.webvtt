00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.796 A:middle
us to customize how specialized

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:02.606 A:middle
names, nouns, and other things

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:03.266 A:middle
are pronounced.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.116 A:middle
It's available in these

00:07:06.116 --> 00:07:06.766 A:middle
languages.

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:10.886 A:middle
And here is an example of what

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:11.566 A:middle
it might look like.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:13.676 A:middle
To pronounce the iPhone in the

00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:15.286 A:middle
way that we are used to, you

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.836 A:middle
would use this IPA notation.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.756 A:middle
Now the obvious question is how

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:20.806 A:middle
do you generate this IPA

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:21.406 A:middle
notation?

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:22.886 A:middle
It is not easy to type with a

00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:23.346 A:middle
keyboard.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.306 A:middle
One way to do that is to use the

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.126 A:middle
pronunciation editor in

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.306 A:middle
accessibility settings.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:30.886 A:middle
So when you go to the settings

00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:33.046 A:middle
app, go into accessibility and

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:33.836 A:middle
speech, you will find

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.376 A:middle
pronunciations and find a screen

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.056 A:middle
like this.

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:37.946 A:middle
You can enter in the phrase that

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:39.536 A:middle
you want to find the correct

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:41.066 A:middle
pronunciation for, tap the

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:42.666 A:middle
microphone button, and then

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.136 A:middle
speak it.

00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:45.796 A:middle
After you're done, you'll be

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:47.516 A:middle
presented with options on

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:48.686 A:middle
possible variations.

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.346 A:middle
As you tap those, it will say

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.036 A:middle
those out loud.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.106 A:middle
You can choose the one that

00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:53.656 A:middle
sounds correct and then copy

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:55.876 A:middle
this value that you get into

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:56.366 A:middle
your code.

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.136 A:middle
So let's see how that's done.

00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:00.966 A:middle
First, we make an attributed
