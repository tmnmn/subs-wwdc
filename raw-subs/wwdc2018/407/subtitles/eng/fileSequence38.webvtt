00:37:59.616 --> 00:38:00.876 A:middle
we don't need.

00:38:01.396 --> 00:38:02.546 A:middle
The second one is that we want

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.506 A:middle
to be proactive, and it's valid

00:38:04.506 --> 00:38:05.256 A:middle
for two things.

00:38:05.256 --> 00:38:07.866 A:middle
It's valid for being proactive

00:38:08.006 --> 00:38:09.716 A:middle
in order to anticipate the work

00:38:09.716 --> 00:38:12.296 A:middle
that we are making it later, we

00:38:12.296 --> 00:38:13.526 A:middle
also want to be proactive and

00:38:13.526 --> 00:38:15.176 A:middle
catch regressions quickly, so

00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:16.116 A:middle
you should make sure that you

00:38:16.116 --> 00:38:17.586 A:middle
have continuous integration

00:38:17.916 --> 00:38:18.716 A:middle
testing in place.

00:38:21.536 --> 00:38:23.116 A:middle
And the last point is we want to

00:38:23.116 --> 00:38:24.726 A:middle
be constant, regardless of the

00:38:24.806 --> 00:38:26.046 A:middle
total amount of data that we

00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:26.566 A:middle
need to load.

00:38:29.496 --> 00:38:31.646 A:middle
Now, if we were taking a naÃ¯ve

00:38:31.646 --> 00:38:32.986 A:middle
approach, and we were loading

00:38:32.986 --> 00:38:34.186 A:middle
everything we needed during

00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:35.366 A:middle
launch, this is how long it

00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:37.806 A:middle
would take roughly for a 30,000

00:38:37.806 --> 00:38:38.556 A:middle
item library.

00:38:39.696 --> 00:38:41.106 A:middle
First you need to initialize the

00:38:41.106 --> 00:38:42.696 A:middle
database, then you need to

00:38:42.696 --> 00:38:43.986 A:middle
prepare some view controllers.

00:38:44.356 --> 00:38:45.516 A:middle
You need to configure the data

00:38:45.516 --> 00:38:47.236 A:middle
sources, load some library

00:38:47.236 --> 00:38:48.586 A:middle
images, and fetch the cloud

00:38:48.586 --> 00:38:49.066 A:middle
status.

00:38:49.986 --> 00:38:52.236 A:middle
And keep in mind that this might

00:38:52.306 --> 00:38:54.496 A:middle
vary as the data grow, and in

00:38:54.496 --> 00:38:56.666 A:middle
fact, the data will grow forever

00:38:56.666 --> 00:38:58.606 A:middle
as people takes pictures every

00:38:59.526 --> 00:38:59.593 A:middle
day.
