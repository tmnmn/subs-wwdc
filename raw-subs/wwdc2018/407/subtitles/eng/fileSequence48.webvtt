00:48:01.156 --> 00:48:03.336 A:middle
Now, we use image raw data so

00:48:03.336 --> 00:48:04.866 A:middle
that we can avoid decoding each

00:48:04.866 --> 00:48:07.766 A:middle
thumbnail as we send.

00:48:08.376 --> 00:48:09.576 A:middle
So basically we are displaying a

00:48:09.576 --> 00:48:10.726 A:middle
random strip of images.

00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:14.286 A:middle
Now, we generate and cache them

00:48:14.286 --> 00:48:15.566 A:middle
on the fly so that we can be

00:48:15.566 --> 00:48:16.206 A:middle
more flexible.

00:48:18.436 --> 00:48:20.086 A:middle
And as we render multiple images

00:48:20.086 --> 00:48:22.026 A:middle
into a single one, we are

00:48:22.026 --> 00:48:23.316 A:middle
registering the number of cells,

00:48:23.316 --> 00:48:24.716 A:middle
layers, objects drastically,

00:48:24.716 --> 00:48:26.006 A:middle
which simplifies the layout and

00:48:26.006 --> 00:48:29.066 A:middle
the time spent building it.

00:48:29.686 --> 00:48:31.266 A:middle
Now, the separate works well,

00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:32.356 A:middle
but it has trade offs to

00:48:32.356 --> 00:48:34.386 A:middle
consider as well, and this is

00:48:34.386 --> 00:48:34.966 A:middle
one of them.

00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:38.606 A:middle
So if someone tries to long

00:48:38.606 --> 00:48:40.996 A:middle
press or force search an item

00:48:40.996 --> 00:48:42.866 A:middle
here, we will need to figure its

00:48:42.916 --> 00:48:44.536 A:middle
position so that we can achieve

00:48:44.536 --> 00:48:45.426 A:middle
the preview correctly.

00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:48.136 A:middle
And as we display a single

00:48:48.136 --> 00:48:50.776 A:middle
image, we need to maintain the

00:48:50.776 --> 00:48:53.156 A:middle
mapping of each individual

00:48:53.156 --> 00:48:54.736 A:middle
image, and its render strip.

00:48:56.086 --> 00:48:57.226 A:middle
Now, you might be thinking, why

00:48:57.226 --> 00:48:58.216 A:middle
are we generating them on the

00:48:58.216 --> 00:48:58.536 A:middle
fly?
