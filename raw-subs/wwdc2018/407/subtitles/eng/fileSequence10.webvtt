00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.506 A:middle
So, if I was writing code

00:10:01.506 --> 00:10:03.106 A:middle
completion unit tests for Xcode,

00:10:03.756 --> 00:10:05.996 A:middle
I'm sorry, integration tests, I

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:08.466 A:middle
would launch the full Xcode app.

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:09.566 A:middle
I would open a source file.

00:10:09.566 --> 00:10:11.136 A:middle
I would navigate to the source

00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:13.366 A:middle
file, and I would type, and I

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:14.396 A:middle
would bring up code completion

00:10:14.486 --> 00:10:15.306 A:middle
over and over again.

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:17.636 A:middle
When I profile this, to see what

00:10:17.636 --> 00:10:18.686 A:middle
Xcode is doing, and how much

00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:20.316 A:middle
time it is taking, I am going to

00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:21.886 A:middle
find that this test is anything

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:22.956 A:middle
but focused and quiet.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:25.476 A:middle
Xcode is going to be doing

00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:26.986 A:middle
drawing and layout as I type.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:28.996 A:middle
It is going to be doing syntax

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:29.906 A:middle
coloring as I type.

00:10:30.556 --> 00:10:31.536 A:middle
In the background, it might be

00:10:31.536 --> 00:10:33.636 A:middle
indexing, fetching get status,

00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:35.506 A:middle
deciding to show new files in

00:10:35.506 --> 00:10:35.976 A:middle
the Assistant Editor,

00:10:36.056 --> 00:10:36.866 A:middle
and all of these things are

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:40.056 A:middle
going to be competing for CPU

00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:41.806 A:middle
resources, along with code

00:10:41.806 --> 00:10:42.246 A:middle
completion.

00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:44.046 A:middle
Maybe when I look in the

00:10:44.046 --> 00:10:45.786 A:middle
Profiler, I'll see that we spend

00:10:45.786 --> 00:10:47.636 A:middle
80% of our time syntax coloring,

00:10:47.916 --> 00:10:50.136 A:middle
and 20% of our time in code

00:10:50.136 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
completion.

00:10:51.086 --> 00:10:52.636 A:middle
And with this data, I would know

00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:54.776 A:middle
that the best way to improve

00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:55.976 A:middle
code completion performance

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.696 A:middle
would be to defer syntax

00:10:57.746 --> 00:10:58.076 A:middle
coloring.

00:10:58.686 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
I will never gain that type of
