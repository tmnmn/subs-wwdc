00:18:59.996 --> 00:19:02.036 A:middle
this call, which is to IDE

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:04.636 A:middle
Navigator, replacement view, did

00:19:04.636 --> 00:19:05.576 A:middle
install view controller.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:07.106 A:middle
Now, I'm familiar with this API,

00:19:07.106 --> 00:19:08.746 A:middle
because it's an internal API of

00:19:08.746 --> 00:19:09.176 A:middle
Xcode.

00:19:10.156 --> 00:19:12.686 A:middle
And in the trace, I can see over

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:13.636 A:middle
here on the left-hand side of

00:19:13.636 --> 00:19:14.686 A:middle
the window that it is

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:18.656 A:middle
responsible for 1.19 seconds of

00:19:18.656 --> 00:19:19.846 A:middle
the total time we're recording,

00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:21.596 A:middle
or 45% of the time.

00:19:22.176 --> 00:19:24.196 A:middle
That is far and away above my

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:25.356 A:middle
expectations for how much this

00:19:25.356 --> 00:19:27.756 A:middle
method should cost.

00:19:27.936 --> 00:19:29.526 A:middle
However, it's hard to focus on

00:19:29.526 --> 00:19:30.386 A:middle
what is happening here.

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.336 A:middle
Right? I'm, there is all this

00:19:32.336 --> 00:19:33.346 A:middle
other stuff at the bottom of the

00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.926 A:middle
trace, and it looks like I'm,

00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:37.596 A:middle
you know, 30 or 40 stack ranges

00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:37.736 A:middle
deep.

00:19:38.056 --> 00:19:39.096 A:middle
That can be intimidating.

00:19:39.456 --> 00:19:40.726 A:middle
I want to show you how to focus.

00:19:41.276 --> 00:19:43.006 A:middle
The first technique is back here

00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:46.976 A:middle
in that call tree popover again.

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:49.126 A:middle
I'm going to use this popover to

00:19:49.126 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
choose the flattened recursion.

00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:55.126 A:middle
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:19:55.196 --> 00:19:56.326 A:middle
And now you can see that, that

00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:57.526 A:middle
repeated set of method calls

00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:00.466 A:middle
that was right here, oops, has
