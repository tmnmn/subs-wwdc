00:36:58.746 --> 00:37:00.256 A:middle
The first part is being spent in

00:37:00.256 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
DYD, this is the loader that is

00:37:02.156 --> 00:37:03.466 A:middle
going to load and link all of

00:37:03.466 --> 00:37:05.416 A:middle
your dependent libraries, but

00:37:05.416 --> 00:37:06.436 A:middle
it's also going to run your

00:37:06.436 --> 00:37:07.576 A:middle
static initializers.

00:37:08.766 --> 00:37:10.316 A:middle
And your control over that part

00:37:10.426 --> 00:37:11.476 A:middle
is limited, but it's not

00:37:11.476 --> 00:37:11.886 A:middle
impossible.

00:37:12.576 --> 00:37:14.886 A:middle
I would encourage you to watch

00:37:14.886 --> 00:37:17.166 A:middle
the DYD session from last year

00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:21.496 A:middle
in order to get more details on

00:37:21.496 --> 00:37:21.896 A:middle
that part.

00:37:23.566 --> 00:37:25.686 A:middle
Now DYD is also calling Main in

00:37:25.686 --> 00:37:27.486 A:middle
your object table, which leads

00:37:27.486 --> 00:37:28.716 A:middle
us to the second part here,

00:37:29.106 --> 00:37:30.356 A:middle
where you have lots of control

00:37:30.356 --> 00:37:32.236 A:middle
over, and this part, you need to

00:37:32.236 --> 00:37:34.016 A:middle
make sure that it stays under

00:37:34.016 --> 00:37:35.056 A:middle
500 milliseconds.

00:37:35.976 --> 00:37:37.376 A:middle
Now, the first [inaudible] pass

00:37:37.376 --> 00:37:38.386 A:middle
that is being scheduled right

00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:39.786 A:middle
after the Did Finish launching

00:37:40.276 --> 00:37:41.286 A:middle
will mark the end of your

00:37:41.286 --> 00:37:42.796 A:middle
launch, and this is basically

00:37:42.796 --> 00:37:43.946 A:middle
when your app should be usable.

00:37:46.016 --> 00:37:47.556 A:middle
There are a few principles that

00:37:47.606 --> 00:37:49.116 A:middle
we will be referring to during

00:37:49.116 --> 00:37:51.056 A:middle
this session, and these are

00:37:51.056 --> 00:37:52.316 A:middle
really the common pillars of the

00:37:52.316 --> 00:37:53.456 A:middle
performance work that we

00:37:53.456 --> 00:37:53.846 A:middle
achieved.

00:37:55.116 --> 00:37:56.976 A:middle
The first one is that we want to

00:37:56.976 --> 00:37:59.566 A:middle
be lazy and defer the work that

00:37:59.616 --> 00:38:00.876 A:middle
we don't need.
