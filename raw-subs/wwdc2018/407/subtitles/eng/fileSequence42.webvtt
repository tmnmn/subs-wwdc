00:41:59.396 --> 00:42:01.086 A:middle
content that we need here.

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.046 A:middle
In that case here, we are only

00:42:04.046 --> 00:42:05.016 A:middle
going to load the visible

00:42:05.016 --> 00:42:07.466 A:middle
content, which in our case is

00:42:07.466 --> 00:42:09.096 A:middle
going to be between 7 to 10

00:42:09.096 --> 00:42:09.616 A:middle
Moments.

00:42:10.956 --> 00:42:12.536 A:middle
Since our deficit is limited,

00:42:12.876 --> 00:42:14.616 A:middle
and finite, we can allow

00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:16.066 A:middle
ourselves to do it synchronously

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:18.376 A:middle
on the main thread.

00:42:18.696 --> 00:42:20.896 A:middle
Now, we also want to anticipate

00:42:20.896 --> 00:42:23.526 A:middle
and schedule the work so that we

00:42:23.526 --> 00:42:25.546 A:middle
can start loading the remaining

00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:26.596 A:middle
data as synchronously.

00:42:27.156 --> 00:42:28.406 A:middle
And we do that on the bug run

00:42:28.406 --> 00:42:30.236 A:middle
thread, with the right quality

00:42:30.316 --> 00:42:31.356 A:middle
of service to make sure that it

00:42:31.356 --> 00:42:32.556 A:middle
doesn't preempt the main thread

00:42:32.556 --> 00:42:33.886 A:middle
from running.

00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:40.516 A:middle
Now we are aiming at 100

00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:41.416 A:middle
milliseconds here.

00:42:44.706 --> 00:42:48.266 A:middle
So lastly, our data sources are

00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:50.226 A:middle
also providing some images and

00:42:50.226 --> 00:42:51.456 A:middle
let's see how we optimize that

00:42:51.506 --> 00:42:51.736 A:middle
part.

00:42:53.666 --> 00:42:54.916 A:middle
So this was by far the biggest

00:42:54.916 --> 00:42:55.936 A:middle
chunk here that we are all

00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:57.986 A:middle
attacking, and when we realized

00:42:57.986 --> 00:42:59.066 A:middle
that we were spending multiple

00:42:59.066 --> 00:43:00.376 A:middle
seconds loading this image
