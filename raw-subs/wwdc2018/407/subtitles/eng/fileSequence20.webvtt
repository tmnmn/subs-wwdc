00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:00.466 A:middle
that was right here, oops, has

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.086 A:middle
been collapsed.

00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:04.536 A:middle
I'm sorry, let me scroll down.

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:06.466 A:middle
That has been collapsed.

00:20:06.816 --> 00:20:08.436 A:middle
In fact, I'm confident that I

00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:09.586 A:middle
want to continue my performance

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:11.556 A:middle
investigation inside of this IDE

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:14.506 A:middle
Navigator area, API call, and I

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.336 A:middle
can refocus the entire call tree

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.376 A:middle
by context, clicking here, and

00:20:19.376 --> 00:20:20.746 A:middle
choosing Focus on Subtree.

00:20:21.516 --> 00:20:22.446 A:middle
And Instruments is going to take

00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:23.896 A:middle
that symbol up to the top of the

00:20:23.896 --> 00:20:25.386 A:middle
call graph, it's going to remove

00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:26.556 A:middle
everything else, and it is going

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.456 A:middle
to reset the percentages at 100%

00:20:28.726 --> 00:20:30.166 A:middle
so I can focus on just this.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.096 A:middle
Now, I can continue to walk this

00:20:33.096 --> 00:20:35.686 A:middle
sample with the arrow keys to

00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:36.486 A:middle
see what we're doing.

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:38.496 A:middle
And I'm familiar with these

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:38.906 A:middle
APIs.

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.046 A:middle
And it looks like we're doing

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:41.196 A:middle
state restoration.

00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:43.136 A:middle
And as I continue to expand

00:20:43.136 --> 00:20:45.936 A:middle
this, I can see that we are sort

00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:47.176 A:middle
of deep inside the table view,

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:49.696 A:middle
and in addition to there being

00:20:49.696 --> 00:20:51.476 A:middle
this sort of hot call path, you

00:20:51.476 --> 00:20:52.986 A:middle
know, that is taking large

00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:54.116 A:middle
number of the total percentage,

00:20:54.436 --> 00:20:55.246 A:middle
there's all these other

00:20:55.246 --> 00:20:56.566 A:middle
incidental samples as well.

00:20:58.266 --> 00:20:59.896 A:middle
It's easy to get distracted by

00:20:59.896 --> 00:21:00.236 A:middle
these.
