00:40:59.936 --> 00:41:01.756 A:middle
ensure that only the visible

00:41:01.756 --> 00:41:02.376 A:middle
views are loaded.

00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:06.116 A:middle
It's easy, and we often regress

00:41:06.116 --> 00:41:07.806 A:middle
on that part, so you should

00:41:07.806 --> 00:41:11.376 A:middle
really be careful about that.

00:41:12.016 --> 00:41:12.706 A:middle
So preparing the view

00:41:12.706 --> 00:41:14.106 A:middle
controllers, we are now aiming

00:41:14.106 --> 00:41:15.696 A:middle
for 120 milliseconds.

00:41:16.626 --> 00:41:18.376 A:middle
But preparing view controllers

00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:19.646 A:middle
implies configuring the data

00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:21.586 A:middle
sources, and let's look at that

00:41:21.586 --> 00:41:22.216 A:middle
chunk next.

00:41:25.056 --> 00:41:26.716 A:middle
So the Moments view is a

00:41:26.716 --> 00:41:27.996 A:middle
representation of these things,

00:41:27.996 --> 00:41:30.086 A:middle
events in your life, and the UI

00:41:30.086 --> 00:41:31.376 A:middle
represents that by having this

00:41:31.426 --> 00:41:32.796 A:middle
group of photos, and these

00:41:32.866 --> 00:41:33.266 A:middle
headers.

00:41:34.206 --> 00:41:35.866 A:middle
In this library, for example, we

00:41:35.866 --> 00:41:38.596 A:middle
might have 500 moments, and in

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:40.026 A:middle
order to build a view, we need

00:41:40.026 --> 00:41:40.766 A:middle
to load all the moments up

00:41:40.766 --> 00:41:40.976 A:middle
front.

00:41:43.236 --> 00:41:44.706 A:middle
But the only thing we need

00:41:44.956 --> 00:41:46.846 A:middle
really for these moments is only

00:41:46.846 --> 00:41:48.666 A:middle
the meta data so we can build

00:41:48.666 --> 00:41:48.986 A:middle
the view.

00:41:49.706 --> 00:41:50.676 A:middle
We don't need your content.

00:41:51.226 --> 00:41:54.846 A:middle
So the first thing we do is we

00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.366 A:middle
fire that query, which is super

00:41:56.366 --> 00:41:56.726 A:middle
fast.

00:41:56.926 --> 00:41:59.356 A:middle
And then we are only loading the

00:41:59.396 --> 00:42:01.086 A:middle
content that we need here.
