00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:00.736 A:middle
start to load, but then you'll

00:33:00.736 --> 00:33:01.766 A:middle
keep scrolling and then you'll

00:33:01.766 --> 00:33:02.886 A:middle
experience some frame drops

00:33:02.886 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
because the views are being

00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:04.326 A:middle
updated.

00:33:05.556 --> 00:33:06.836 A:middle
Well, our goal is to not show

00:33:06.836 --> 00:33:07.626 A:middle
views like this.

00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:09.876 A:middle
We think this is not providing a

00:33:09.926 --> 00:33:12.066 A:middle
great user experience, but we

00:33:12.066 --> 00:33:13.366 A:middle
understand that sometimes it's

00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:14.156 A:middle
unavoidable.

00:33:14.556 --> 00:33:15.706 A:middle
But when it's too frequent, this

00:33:15.706 --> 00:33:16.666 A:middle
isn't really great.

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:19.666 A:middle
Now, when you work on an app,

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:20.756 A:middle
you want to make sure that it's

00:33:20.756 --> 00:33:22.456 A:middle
responsive, and usable at once.

00:33:23.576 --> 00:33:25.296 A:middle
You also want to make sure that

00:33:25.296 --> 00:33:26.516 A:middle
the animations are smooth.

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:30.516 A:middle
And these two attributes are

00:33:30.516 --> 00:33:31.796 A:middle
really crucial to providing a

00:33:31.796 --> 00:33:32.786 A:middle
great user experience.

00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:35.766 A:middle
If the users don't find your app

00:33:35.766 --> 00:33:37.256 A:middle
relatable or pertinent, they

00:33:37.256 --> 00:33:38.146 A:middle
might stop using it.

00:33:39.526 --> 00:33:40.706 A:middle
Now, to illustrate these two

00:33:40.706 --> 00:33:42.626 A:middle
points, I would like to give you

00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:43.426 A:middle
two examples.

00:33:43.716 --> 00:33:45.726 A:middle
And the first one is going to be

00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:47.406 A:middle
how we optimize launching to

00:33:47.406 --> 00:33:48.166 A:middle
this moment view.

00:33:48.886 --> 00:33:50.506 A:middle
The second one is how we build

00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:52.576 A:middle
the collections and years view

00:33:52.576 --> 00:33:53.866 A:middle
for good scrolling preference.

00:33:56.696 --> 00:33:59.876 A:middle
First, let's do launching
