00:31:59.316 --> 00:32:00.296 A:middle
directly from photos.

00:32:01.306 --> 00:32:02.556 A:middle
So first, let's talk about

00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:03.536 A:middle
photos for a second.

00:32:04.076 --> 00:32:05.276 A:middle
We are all familiar with this

00:32:05.276 --> 00:32:05.466 A:middle
app.

00:32:06.026 --> 00:32:07.766 A:middle
It lets you store, browse, and

00:32:07.846 --> 00:32:09.296 A:middle
experience your favorite

00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:09.696 A:middle
moments.

00:32:10.236 --> 00:32:11.686 A:middle
So you can browse your favorite

00:32:11.716 --> 00:32:13.526 A:middle
moments from the moments view,

00:32:13.646 --> 00:32:14.596 A:middle
that you can see here.

00:32:14.596 --> 00:32:15.496 A:middle
It's is the default view.

00:32:15.926 --> 00:32:17.526 A:middle
But you can also get another

00:32:17.526 --> 00:32:19.456 A:middle
view from the collection, or the

00:32:19.456 --> 00:32:19.926 A:middle
years.

00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:22.166 A:middle
And I'll talk more about this

00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:22.736 A:middle
view later.

00:32:23.446 --> 00:32:25.306 A:middle
Now, libraries today can go from

00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:28.346 A:middle
1,000 to 100,000 assets previous

00:32:29.126 --> 00:32:30.066 A:middle
depending on your love for

00:32:30.066 --> 00:32:30.636 A:middle
photography.

00:32:31.196 --> 00:32:33.036 A:middle
And we all love capturing those

00:32:33.036 --> 00:32:34.696 A:middle
fun and precious moments we live

00:32:34.696 --> 00:32:34.976 A:middle
every day.

00:32:36.336 --> 00:32:37.366 A:middle
So we are patient enough to

00:32:37.366 --> 00:32:38.846 A:middle
capture them, but we are less

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:40.156 A:middle
patient when something like this

00:32:40.156 --> 00:32:40.576 A:middle
appears.

00:32:41.286 --> 00:32:42.346 A:middle
How would you feel if something

00:32:42.346 --> 00:32:44.226 A:middle
moments like this would be

00:32:44.226 --> 00:32:45.296 A:middle
displayed in Photos the first

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.926 A:middle
time you launch the app?

00:32:47.386 --> 00:32:48.636 A:middle
Now, you may also experience

00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:50.596 A:middle
something like this, where we

00:32:50.596 --> 00:32:51.716 A:middle
are showing a lot of

00:32:51.716 --> 00:32:53.106 A:middle
placeholders, and that's really

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:53.586 A:middle
not great.

00:32:54.266 --> 00:32:55.356 A:middle
Maybe you're soft scrolling,

00:32:55.856 --> 00:32:57.216 A:middle
you'll be lost in this gray

00:32:57.216 --> 00:32:58.936 A:middle
area, the [inaudible] would

00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:00.736 A:middle
start to load, but then you'll
