00:36:00.996 --> 00:36:02.256 A:middle
placeholder or [inaudible].

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:04.346 A:middle
And I Have to be honest with

00:36:04.346 --> 00:36:06.686 A:middle
you, we-- you might see some

00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:07.886 A:middle
placeholders the first time you

00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:09.536 A:middle
synchronize with iClub, but when

00:36:09.536 --> 00:36:11.196 A:middle
the data is local, we really try

00:36:11.266 --> 00:36:13.746 A:middle
our best to not display any.

00:36:13.996 --> 00:36:15.446 A:middle
Now, what do we mean by instant?

00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:17.606 A:middle
Well, the time it takes to

00:36:17.606 --> 00:36:18.836 A:middle
launch should be the same time

00:36:18.836 --> 00:36:20.106 A:middle
as the zoom animation from the

00:36:20.106 --> 00:36:20.646 A:middle
home screen.

00:36:21.086 --> 00:36:22.506 A:middle
That is usually between 500 and

00:36:22.506 --> 00:36:24.796 A:middle
600 milliseconds, and that way,

00:36:25.176 --> 00:36:26.386 A:middle
the transition from the home

00:36:26.386 --> 00:36:27.726 A:middle
screen to the application is

00:36:27.836 --> 00:36:29.426 A:middle
seamless for the user, and the

00:36:29.426 --> 00:36:31.036 A:middle
user can start interacting with

00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:32.576 A:middle
it, as soon as the animation is

00:36:32.626 --> 00:36:32.876 A:middle
done.

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:34.666 A:middle
And by the way, this is the

00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:35.986 A:middle
lowest recommendation, not

00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:37.546 A:middle
something just for photos, so

00:36:37.546 --> 00:36:40.186 A:middle
it's valid for any apps.

00:36:40.346 --> 00:36:41.666 A:middle
Now, let's look at how photos

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:42.266 A:middle
launches today.

00:36:43.436 --> 00:36:44.956 A:middle
If we look more closely at what

00:36:44.956 --> 00:36:46.576 A:middle
is happening exactly, you can

00:36:46.576 --> 00:36:48.656 A:middle
see that photos is all set up

00:36:48.656 --> 00:36:50.146 A:middle
and ready before the animation

00:36:50.146 --> 00:36:50.576 A:middle
is done.

00:36:53.466 --> 00:36:55.216 A:middle
And if we dive into the launch

00:36:55.216 --> 00:36:57.356 A:middle
anatomy, you will see there is

00:36:57.356 --> 00:36:58.326 A:middle
mainly two parts.

00:36:58.746 --> 00:37:00.256 A:middle
The first part is being spent in
