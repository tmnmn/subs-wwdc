00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:01.116 A:middle
That definitely doesn't meet my

00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
expectations as far as

00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:04.036 A:middle
performance goes, and we need to

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:04.596 A:middle
fix this.

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:06.376 A:middle
So let's take a look at how you

00:12:06.376 --> 00:12:06.826 A:middle
would do that.

00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:09.106 A:middle
First, I'm going to launch

00:12:09.106 --> 00:12:09.566 A:middle
Instruments.

00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:10.716 A:middle
That is our profiling tool.

00:12:11.436 --> 00:12:12.686 A:middle
You can do that from the Xcode

00:12:12.686 --> 00:12:14.586 A:middle
menu, under Open Developer Tool,

00:12:14.886 --> 00:12:15.506 A:middle
Instruments.

00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:17.766 A:middle
Now, I'm currently in Xcode 9,

00:12:18.106 --> 00:12:19.146 A:middle
so if I choose this, it's going

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:20.036 A:middle
to launch the Instruments from

00:12:20.036 --> 00:12:21.476 A:middle
Xcode 9, and of course, I want

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:22.606 A:middle
the Instruments from Xcode 10,

00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:23.766 A:middle
which I've put here in my doc.

00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:26.066 A:middle
So I'm going to hide Xcode, and

00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:28.956 A:middle
bring up Instruments.

00:12:29.146 --> 00:12:30.366 A:middle
Now, when Instruments launches,

00:12:31.796 --> 00:12:33.026 A:middle
we're presented with a list of

00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:34.226 A:middle
profiling tools that we could

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:35.546 A:middle
use to measure our application.

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.426 A:middle
There's all kinds of tools here.

00:12:37.786 --> 00:12:38.736 A:middle
They can measure graphics

00:12:38.736 --> 00:12:41.186 A:middle
utilization, memory consumption,

00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:44.006 A:middle
IO, and time in general.

00:12:45.726 --> 00:12:47.096 A:middle
It can be intimidating to know

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:48.406 A:middle
which one of these profilers to

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:49.676 A:middle
start with.

00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:53.936 A:middle
I would encourage all of you, if

00:12:53.936 --> 00:12:55.596 A:middle
you just learn one of these

00:12:55.596 --> 00:12:56.976 A:middle
tools, it should be the Time

00:12:56.976 --> 00:12:57.516 A:middle
Profiler.

00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
I use it for 95% or more of my
