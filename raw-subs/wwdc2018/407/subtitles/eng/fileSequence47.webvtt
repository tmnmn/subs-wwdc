00:46:59.356 --> 00:47:01.486 A:middle
Now, let's take a step back, and

00:47:01.486 --> 00:47:02.636 A:middle
look at what we are trying to

00:47:02.636 --> 00:47:03.176 A:middle
achieve here.

00:47:03.866 --> 00:47:05.076 A:middle
We wanted to have this portable

00:47:05.076 --> 00:47:06.896 A:middle
view, with sections and mini

00:47:06.896 --> 00:47:07.466 A:middle
cells in it.

00:47:09.846 --> 00:47:11.226 A:middle
And that is basically what your

00:47:11.226 --> 00:47:12.836 A:middle
Collection view is providing,

00:47:12.836 --> 00:47:13.076 A:middle
right?

00:47:13.636 --> 00:47:15.036 A:middle
Except that in this extreme

00:47:15.036 --> 00:47:16.246 A:middle
case, we are restricting the

00:47:16.246 --> 00:47:17.506 A:middle
limit of what we could achieve

00:47:17.506 --> 00:47:18.576 A:middle
with a basic approach.

00:47:18.746 --> 00:47:20.546 A:middle
And that resulted in too many

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:21.616 A:middle
views, too many layers.

00:47:23.796 --> 00:47:26.256 A:middle
But also in an increased layered

00:47:26.256 --> 00:47:28.396 A:middle
complexity, and that also had an

00:47:28.396 --> 00:47:30.086 A:middle
increased memory cost.

00:47:31.706 --> 00:47:33.086 A:middle
So we needed to innovate here,

00:47:33.846 --> 00:47:35.126 A:middle
and we did that by restricting

00:47:35.126 --> 00:47:36.436 A:middle
the number of views drastically

00:47:36.436 --> 00:47:37.826 A:middle
while still using a collection

00:47:37.826 --> 00:47:37.966 A:middle
view.

00:47:40.176 --> 00:47:42.066 A:middle
We used a technique more

00:47:42.066 --> 00:47:43.466 A:middle
commonly used in video games,

00:47:43.466 --> 00:47:44.606 A:middle
that is called atlasing.

00:47:45.146 --> 00:47:47.106 A:middle
And it basically consists of

00:47:47.106 --> 00:47:48.766 A:middle
combining a set of images into a

00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:49.406 A:middle
single one.

00:47:50.536 --> 00:47:52.186 A:middle
We do that efficiently by using

00:47:52.186 --> 00:47:53.806 A:middle
only very small thumbnails

00:47:53.806 --> 00:47:56.736 A:middle
first, then we stamp all the raw

00:47:56.736 --> 00:47:58.856 A:middle
image data on the canvas we are

00:47:58.856 --> 00:47:59.716 A:middle
using as a strip.
