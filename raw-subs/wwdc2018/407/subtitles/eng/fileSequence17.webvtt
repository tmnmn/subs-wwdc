00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:00.556 A:middle
Sometimes you'll have much more.

00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:01.716 A:middle
Depends on how concurrent your

00:17:01.716 --> 00:17:02.436 A:middle
application is.

00:17:03.306 --> 00:17:04.796 A:middle
I often like to collapse these

00:17:04.796 --> 00:17:06.276 A:middle
in the name of focusing, and I

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.756 A:middle
also like to collapse them so

00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:10.356 A:middle
they're based on the top level

00:17:10.356 --> 00:17:11.976 A:middle
functions executing in each of

00:17:11.976 --> 00:17:13.346 A:middle
the threads, rather than the

00:17:13.346 --> 00:17:14.636 A:middle
thread IDs, because that

00:17:14.636 --> 00:17:16.165 A:middle
corresponds better with how I

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.406 A:middle
use Grand Central Dispatch.

00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:19.715 A:middle
Down in the bottom of the

00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:21.076 A:middle
Instruments window, I'm going to

00:17:21.076 --> 00:17:22.236 A:middle
click on this button that says

00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:24.576 A:middle
Call Tree, and I'm going to zoom

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:25.536 A:middle
in on it, so you can see what

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:26.076 A:middle
I'm about to do.

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:27.935 A:middle
There are several filters

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:28.556 A:middle
available here.

00:17:28.906 --> 00:17:30.136 A:middle
One of them is separate by

00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:30.516 A:middle
thread.

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.756 A:middle
It is on by default.

00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:33.176 A:middle
I am going to go ahead and

00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:35.466 A:middle
disable that, and instead, all

00:17:35.466 --> 00:17:36.326 A:middle
of the threads are going to be

00:17:36.326 --> 00:17:37.586 A:middle
grouped by their top level entry

00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:38.926 A:middle
point, rather than their thread

00:17:39.596 --> 00:17:39.666 A:middle
ID.

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:45.646 A:middle
Now, looking at this trace, I

00:17:45.646 --> 00:17:46.946 A:middle
can see that of all these

00:17:46.946 --> 00:17:49.336 A:middle
threads running, which by the

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:50.816 A:middle
way, below the main trace, which

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:53.126 A:middle
is the aggregate CPU usage, the

00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:54.416 A:middle
CPU usage is broken down per

00:17:54.416 --> 00:17:56.086 A:middle
thread, I can see that almost

00:17:56.086 --> 00:17:57.046 A:middle
all the other threads were

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.456 A:middle
largely inactive during this

00:17:58.456 --> 00:17:58.826 A:middle
trace.

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:00.836 A:middle
I can focus on just the main
