00:44:59.486 --> 00:45:00.816 A:middle
the most important part of that

00:45:01.246 --> 00:45:02.626 A:middle
is to really make sure that you

00:45:02.626 --> 00:45:03.596 A:middle
think about the cost of

00:45:03.636 --> 00:45:04.656 A:middle
preparing your content.

00:45:05.296 --> 00:45:07.466 A:middle
And what I mean by think is

00:45:07.466 --> 00:45:09.086 A:middle
really measure it.

00:45:10.606 --> 00:45:12.806 A:middle
Now, you should strive for doing

00:45:12.806 --> 00:45:13.746 A:middle
work in constant time,

00:45:13.746 --> 00:45:14.926 A:middle
regardless of the total amount

00:45:14.926 --> 00:45:15.896 A:middle
of data you are loading.

00:45:16.676 --> 00:45:17.796 A:middle
In our case, really have

00:45:17.796 --> 00:45:19.526 A:middle
unbonded data assets, and we

00:45:19.746 --> 00:45:21.976 A:middle
need to stay constant.

00:45:24.756 --> 00:45:25.846 A:middle
Now that we have launched the

00:45:25.846 --> 00:45:27.746 A:middle
app, we need to start using it.

00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:28.866 A:middle
And let's see how we did

00:45:29.096 --> 00:45:30.256 A:middle
collections and [inaudible] for

00:45:30.256 --> 00:45:31.146 A:middle
good [inaudible] performance.

00:45:31.226 --> 00:45:34.416 A:middle
So as I mentioned earlier, our

00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:37.236 A:middle
users can seamlessly transition

00:45:37.236 --> 00:45:39.136 A:middle
with animation from the Moments,

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:40.966 A:middle
through the collections, to the

00:45:40.966 --> 00:45:41.496 A:middle
years view.

00:45:44.316 --> 00:45:46.206 A:middle
And this is a complex hierarchy.

00:45:46.886 --> 00:45:48.306 A:middle
We have thousands of pictures to

00:45:48.306 --> 00:45:48.746 A:middle
display.

00:45:49.606 --> 00:45:51.116 A:middle
We need to support live updates,

00:45:51.686 --> 00:45:53.436 A:middle
we need to also support

00:45:53.436 --> 00:45:55.186 A:middle
animation between these layers,

00:45:55.816 --> 00:45:57.276 A:middle
and we also have some gestures.
