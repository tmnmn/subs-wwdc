00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:00.806 A:middle
going to begin making changes,

00:25:01.046 --> 00:25:01.716 A:middle
then you make a bunch of

00:25:01.716 --> 00:25:02.996 A:middle
changes, and then you say you're

00:25:02.996 --> 00:25:05.046 A:middle
done, and it computes something

00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:05.856 A:middle
that happened for the whole

00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:07.356 A:middle
range of your changes, more

00:25:07.356 --> 00:25:08.656 A:middle
efficiently than if it had done

00:25:08.656 --> 00:25:10.116 A:middle
them all individually.

00:25:11.126 --> 00:25:12.306 A:middle
So at this point, I would head

00:25:12.306 --> 00:25:14.336 A:middle
over to the NS Outline View, or

00:25:14.336 --> 00:25:15.996 A:middle
NS Table View API, and I would

00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:17.296 A:middle
look for some such method.

00:25:17.686 --> 00:25:19.646 A:middle
And there is exactly one there.

00:25:19.646 --> 00:25:20.936 A:middle
In NS Table View, there is

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:22.176 A:middle
methods for beginning and end

00:25:22.176 --> 00:25:23.546 A:middle
updating, that allow the table

00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:25.096 A:middle
view to coalesce, and make all

00:25:25.096 --> 00:25:26.296 A:middle
this work significantly more

00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:26.666 A:middle
efficient.

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:28.856 A:middle
Of course, we adopted that in

00:25:28.896 --> 00:25:29.606 A:middle
Xcode 10.

00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:32.966 A:middle
Let me show you.

00:25:33.046 --> 00:25:34.376 A:middle
I'm going to launch Xcode 10.

00:25:38.056 --> 00:25:39.136 A:middle
I'm going to open the source as

00:25:39.136 --> 00:25:43.086 A:middle
an application, and I'm going to

00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:44.056 A:middle
create a couple of tabs.

00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:46.116 A:middle
And you can see, there is no

00:25:46.116 --> 00:25:47.666 A:middle
awful flashing, and the tabs

00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:48.626 A:middle
open much more quickly.

00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:52.686 A:middle
Now, I'd like the tabs to open

00:25:52.876 --> 00:25:54.846 A:middle
even quicker than that, right?

00:25:54.846 --> 00:25:55.916 A:middle
So what am I going to do next?

00:25:56.596 --> 00:25:57.586 A:middle
I got lucky here.

00:25:58.536 --> 00:25:59.496 A:middle
It's not every day that you're

00:25:59.496 --> 00:26:00.956 A:middle
going to go into the trace, and
