00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:00.836 A:middle
I can focus on just the main

00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:03.036 A:middle
thread by selecting it here, and

00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:04.626 A:middle
now I'm only looking at traces

00:18:04.776 --> 00:18:06.476 A:middle
from the main thread during this

00:18:06.526 --> 00:18:07.046 A:middle
time period.

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:09.606 A:middle
I'm ready to start digging into

00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:11.336 A:middle
this call hierarchy, so I can

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:12.376 A:middle
see what my application was

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:12.676 A:middle
doing.

00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:15.106 A:middle
Often, I'll walk this with the

00:18:15.106 --> 00:18:17.116 A:middle
keyboard, by just pressing right

00:18:17.116 --> 00:18:18.356 A:middle
arrow and down, over and over

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:18.666 A:middle
again.

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:21.026 A:middle
But I'd like to show you the

00:18:21.026 --> 00:18:22.526 A:middle
heaviest back trace inspector

00:18:22.526 --> 00:18:24.136 A:middle
that Instruments offers.

00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:25.416 A:middle
If your Inspector is not

00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:26.886 A:middle
visible, you can toggle it with

00:18:26.886 --> 00:18:28.756 A:middle
this button, and the heaviest

00:18:28.756 --> 00:18:29.746 A:middle
back trace will be available

00:18:29.836 --> 00:18:31.706 A:middle
here, in this tab, Extended

00:18:31.706 --> 00:18:32.046 A:middle
Detail.

00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:34.296 A:middle
Now, the heaviest back trace is

00:18:34.296 --> 00:18:35.496 A:middle
just the trace that occurred

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:36.566 A:middle
most frequently.

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:37.486 A:middle
It's the back trace that

00:18:37.486 --> 00:18:39.196 A:middle
happened most frequently while

00:18:39.196 --> 00:18:40.706 A:middle
we were recording under the

00:18:40.706 --> 00:18:41.476 A:middle
current selection.

00:18:42.116 --> 00:18:43.516 A:middle
And you can use this to quickly

00:18:43.516 --> 00:18:45.176 A:middle
navigate many frames deep at a

00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:45.556 A:middle
time.

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:47.846 A:middle
I typically look through here,

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:49.366 A:middle
looking for my own APIs, and

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:50.816 A:middle
things that would surprise me

00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:51.856 A:middle
for taking up this amount of

00:18:51.856 --> 00:18:54.336 A:middle
time, or for areas where we make

00:18:54.336 --> 00:18:56.036 A:middle
a significant branching point in

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:57.306 A:middle
the number of samples.

00:18:58.356 --> 00:18:59.996 A:middle
Now, looking through here, I see

00:18:59.996 --> 00:19:02.036 A:middle
this call, which is to IDE
