00:49:00.016 --> 00:49:01.736 A:middle
Well, we need to support live

00:49:01.736 --> 00:49:03.626 A:middle
updates, that's the reason.

00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:05.526 A:middle
We need also to support

00:49:05.526 --> 00:49:06.536 A:middle
different view sizes.

00:49:07.426 --> 00:49:08.656 A:middle
For example, we have landscape

00:49:08.656 --> 00:49:09.016 A:middle
here.

00:49:09.516 --> 00:49:11.476 A:middle
But we also have portraits.

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:16.276 A:middle
And also we can do that because

00:49:16.276 --> 00:49:17.096 A:middle
we can [inaudible] because our

00:49:17.096 --> 00:49:18.786 A:middle
user's labor typically grows

00:49:18.786 --> 00:49:20.606 A:middle
organically over a long period

00:49:20.606 --> 00:49:22.766 A:middle
of time, and the cases where we

00:49:22.766 --> 00:49:24.076 A:middle
might need to generate thousands

00:49:24.076 --> 00:49:25.016 A:middle
of them are pretty rare.

00:49:27.716 --> 00:49:29.086 A:middle
Now, you may be wondering also

00:49:29.086 --> 00:49:30.236 A:middle
why are we not generating the

00:49:30.236 --> 00:49:31.016 A:middle
whole section then?

00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:33.776 A:middle
Well the answer is that our

00:49:33.776 --> 00:49:35.306 A:middle
design record is to do this cool

00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:36.966 A:middle
animation, where you can see

00:49:36.966 --> 00:49:37.926 A:middle
that the collections are

00:49:37.926 --> 00:49:39.036 A:middle
expanding into their own

00:49:39.036 --> 00:49:40.436 A:middle
sections or collapsing into

00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:42.196 A:middle
group ones, and the other way

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:42.986 A:middle
around.

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:47.206 A:middle
So if there is one thing that

00:49:47.206 --> 00:49:48.376 A:middle
you should also remember from

00:49:48.376 --> 00:49:49.776 A:middle
that second part is you should

00:49:49.776 --> 00:49:50.916 A:middle
really think about the layout

00:49:50.916 --> 00:49:53.036 A:middle
course of your hierarchy and

00:49:53.036 --> 00:49:54.506 A:middle
measure it.

00:49:56.356 --> 00:49:58.326 A:middle
Lastly, you should always think

00:49:58.326 --> 00:49:59.106 A:middle
about performance.

00:49:59.566 --> 00:50:01.066 A:middle
At Photos, we care deeply about
