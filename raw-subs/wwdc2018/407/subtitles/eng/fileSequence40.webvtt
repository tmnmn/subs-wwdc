00:39:59.576 --> 00:40:01.086 A:middle
and we want to avoid the complex

00:40:01.086 --> 00:40:04.006 A:middle
query as much as possible as

00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:04.876 A:middle
well.

00:40:05.276 --> 00:40:06.986 A:middle
And we sometimes we understand

00:40:06.986 --> 00:40:08.646 A:middle
that we need this, and for these

00:40:08.686 --> 00:40:10.676 A:middle
cases, we are setting up some

00:40:10.676 --> 00:40:12.016 A:middle
indexes, so that we can speed

00:40:12.016 --> 00:40:12.276 A:middle
them up.

00:40:15.676 --> 00:40:17.396 A:middle
Now we are aiming for, at most,

00:40:17.396 --> 00:40:19.546 A:middle
30 milliseconds spent in that

00:40:19.546 --> 00:40:20.406 A:middle
initialization.

00:40:21.286 --> 00:40:22.526 A:middle
So next, let's look at how we

00:40:22.526 --> 00:40:23.246 A:middle
are preparing our view

00:40:23.246 --> 00:40:23.826 A:middle
controllers.

00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:25.986 A:middle
So we have four tabs

00:40:25.986 --> 00:40:27.796 A:middle
representing the main features

00:40:27.906 --> 00:40:29.486 A:middle
of the app.

00:40:29.656 --> 00:40:30.966 A:middle
And so the first thing that we

00:40:30.966 --> 00:40:32.826 A:middle
need to be careful of is we want

00:40:32.826 --> 00:40:33.926 A:middle
to minimize the work that is

00:40:33.926 --> 00:40:35.756 A:middle
being done in the initialization

00:40:35.756 --> 00:40:37.306 A:middle
of these three non-visible ones,

00:40:37.746 --> 00:40:39.896 A:middle
and the rule that we are trying

00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:41.516 A:middle
to follow here is to do as

00:40:41.566 --> 00:40:42.906 A:middle
little work as possible in the

00:40:42.906 --> 00:40:43.666 A:middle
initializers.

00:40:44.396 --> 00:40:45.436 A:middle
We really want to do the bare

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:47.246 A:middle
minimum, and note all the data

00:40:47.246 --> 00:40:47.946 A:middle
in the view that loads.

00:40:50.486 --> 00:40:52.716 A:middle
This also allows us to

00:40:52.786 --> 00:40:54.646 A:middle
initialize our controllers in

00:40:54.706 --> 00:40:56.446 A:middle
constant time.

00:40:58.206 --> 00:40:59.936 A:middle
Now, lastly, we also want to

00:40:59.936 --> 00:41:01.756 A:middle
ensure that only the visible
