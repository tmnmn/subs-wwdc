00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
I use it for 95% or more of my

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:01.166 A:middle
performance work.

00:13:01.736 --> 00:13:03.246 A:middle
When your users complain about

00:13:03.246 --> 00:13:04.546 A:middle
your app being slow, they're

00:13:04.546 --> 00:13:05.726 A:middle
complaining about it taking too

00:13:05.726 --> 00:13:07.796 A:middle
long, and long is time.

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.116 A:middle
If it turns out that you're slow

00:13:10.116 --> 00:13:10.926 A:middle
because you're doing too much

00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:12.636 A:middle
IO, that is going to correlate

00:13:12.636 --> 00:13:13.706 A:middle
with time, and you will be able

00:13:13.706 --> 00:13:14.696 A:middle
to see this with the Time

00:13:14.696 --> 00:13:15.036 A:middle
Profiler.

00:13:15.036 --> 00:13:17.146 A:middle
So if you learn just one

00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:18.376 A:middle
instrument, it should be the

00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:19.126 A:middle
Time Profiler.

00:13:20.276 --> 00:13:21.756 A:middle
Let's take a look at how that

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:22.636 A:middle
works.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:26.646 A:middle
I'm going to launch the Time

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:28.496 A:middle
Profiler by just double clicking

00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:31.246 A:middle
on it here, and make Instruments

00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:32.226 A:middle
take the full best op.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.396 A:middle
Now, we'd like to record Xcode.

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:38.086 A:middle
In the upper left-hand corner of

00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:39.836 A:middle
the Instruments window, you can

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:41.126 A:middle
control which process you're

00:13:41.126 --> 00:13:42.466 A:middle
going to attach to and record.

00:13:43.096 --> 00:13:45.236 A:middle
By default, hitting this record

00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:46.726 A:middle
button would record all

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:47.636 A:middle
processes on my Mac.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.926 A:middle
I just want to focus on Xcode.

00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:56.866 A:middle
I'll switch this popover to

00:13:56.956 --> 00:13:59.046 A:middle
Xcode and hit record.

00:13:59.536 --> 00:14:00.786 A:middle
Now, I like to keep an eye on
