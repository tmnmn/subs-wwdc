00:30:58.676 --> 00:31:00.096 A:middle
you're using dictionaries like

00:31:00.096 --> 00:31:01.366 A:middle
they were objects, then you

00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:02.636 A:middle
probably know you're doing this,

00:31:02.926 --> 00:31:04.216 A:middle
if you have a bunch of string

00:31:04.216 --> 00:31:06.166 A:middle
constants for all the keys, then

00:31:06.166 --> 00:31:07.466 A:middle
you can get a big improvement to

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:09.186 A:middle
code clarity, to code

00:31:09.186 --> 00:31:11.396 A:middle
completion, to re-factoring, to

00:31:11.396 --> 00:31:12.396 A:middle
making the validating your

00:31:12.396 --> 00:31:14.046 A:middle
source code, by using specific

00:31:14.526 --> 00:31:14.966 A:middle
types.

00:31:15.076 --> 00:31:16.136 A:middle
It couldn't be easier with

00:31:16.136 --> 00:31:18.066 A:middle
strucks and swift with their

00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:19.196 A:middle
implicit initializers and

00:31:19.196 --> 00:31:20.816 A:middle
conformance to equitable hash.

00:31:21.336 --> 00:31:23.646 A:middle
And this can just be hands-down

00:31:23.646 --> 00:31:24.586 A:middle
an improvement to your source

00:31:24.586 --> 00:31:26.206 A:middle
code, and you'd be surprised at

00:31:26.206 --> 00:31:27.916 A:middle
how much time you're spending in

00:31:27.916 --> 00:31:29.546 A:middle
string hashing and string

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:31.126 A:middle
equation if you were doing this

00:31:31.126 --> 00:31:32.546 A:middle
millions of times on lots of

00:31:32.546 --> 00:31:33.316 A:middle
small objects.

00:31:34.516 --> 00:31:35.736 A:middle
So with that, I'd like to turn

00:31:35.736 --> 00:31:37.386 A:middle
it over to Matthew to talk to

00:31:37.386 --> 00:31:38.966 A:middle
you about how we've applied

00:31:39.056 --> 00:31:40.226 A:middle
these techniques inside of

00:31:40.226 --> 00:31:40.686 A:middle
photos.

00:31:42.516 --> 00:31:47.866 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:48.366 --> 00:31:48.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Jim.

00:31:49.966 --> 00:31:50.656 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:52.746 A:middle
I'm Matthew Lucas, an engineer

00:31:52.806 --> 00:31:56.076 A:middle
in the photos team, and today I

00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:57.536 A:middle
want to give you some practical

00:31:57.536 --> 00:31:59.316 A:middle
examples on performance from

00:31:59.316 --> 00:32:00.296 A:middle
directly from photos.
