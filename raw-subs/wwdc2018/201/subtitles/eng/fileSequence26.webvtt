00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:01.116 A:middle
implications when you develop

00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:02.616 A:middle
your apps and different scripts

00:26:02.976 --> 00:26:05.616 A:middle
because some concepts don't map

00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:06.776 A:middle
across scripts as easily as

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:07.126 A:middle
others.

00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:08.466 A:middle
So, let me show you a few

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:09.136 A:middle
examples of this.

00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:12.566 A:middle
Let's talk about typefaces.

00:26:13.986 --> 00:26:15.876 A:middle
So, here you see the Health app

00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:16.716 A:middle
in English.

00:26:17.246 --> 00:26:19.546 A:middle
So, you see a lot of labels.

00:26:21.156 --> 00:26:22.566 A:middle
Now, you see the same app in

00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:23.056 A:middle
Catalan.

00:26:23.786 --> 00:26:27.946 A:middle
And lastly, you see the same app

00:26:27.946 --> 00:26:28.656 A:middle
in Vietnamese.

00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:31.336 A:middle
Now, the thing that I'd like to

00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:34.056 A:middle
call your attention to is that

00:26:34.056 --> 00:26:36.106 A:middle
all the text here on screen is

00:26:36.106 --> 00:26:37.606 A:middle
rendered using our system font,

00:26:37.746 --> 00:26:38.376 A:middle
San Francisco.

00:26:39.546 --> 00:26:41.106 A:middle
And the other thing I'd like for

00:26:41.106 --> 00:26:42.456 A:middle
you to notice is that everything

00:26:42.456 --> 00:26:43.276 A:middle
is rendered beautifully.

00:26:44.156 --> 00:26:45.636 A:middle
That's because San Francisco has

00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:47.076 A:middle
support for a huge variety of

00:26:47.076 --> 00:26:47.916 A:middle
different languages.

00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:50.036 A:middle
And when you use the system font

00:26:50.036 --> 00:26:51.446 A:middle
in your apps, you're guaranteed

00:26:51.446 --> 00:26:52.566 A:middle
to get that support for free.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:56.736 A:middle
Now, any text label that you

00:26:56.736 --> 00:26:58.476 A:middle
create in Xcode will get

00:26:58.526 --> 00:26:59.676 A:middle
San Francisco by default.
