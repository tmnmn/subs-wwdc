00:32:59.486 --> 00:33:02.096 A:middle
What do I mean by a style?

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:04.496 A:middle
So, broadly speaking, I'm

00:33:04.496 --> 00:33:06.316 A:middle
referring to aspects of your

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:07.616 A:middle
text that you choose once you've

00:33:07.616 --> 00:33:08.666 A:middle
chosen a typeface.

00:33:09.176 --> 00:33:11.276 A:middle
So, let's say the font weight,

00:33:11.746 --> 00:33:13.616 A:middle
like how bold it is, or whether

00:33:13.616 --> 00:33:16.036 A:middle
it's italicized, and what the

00:33:16.086 --> 00:33:17.246 A:middle
size of the font may be.

00:33:19.546 --> 00:33:21.636 A:middle
So, the key thing to keep in

00:33:21.636 --> 00:33:23.246 A:middle
mind is that some aspects

00:33:23.816 --> 00:33:26.156 A:middle
translate better to other

00:33:26.156 --> 00:33:27.286 A:middle
languages and others don't.

00:33:27.286 --> 00:33:29.086 A:middle
So, let's take a look at an

00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:31.436 A:middle
example of where something might

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:32.136 A:middle
not translate.

00:33:32.876 --> 00:33:34.306 A:middle
So, here we have a simple string

00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:34.816 A:middle
in English.

00:33:35.586 --> 00:33:36.866 A:middle
We've italicized Mars and 2

00:33:36.866 --> 00:33:37.946 A:middle
Travelers to indicate that

00:33:37.946 --> 00:33:39.266 A:middle
they're variables, so they can

00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:39.646 A:middle
change.

00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:42.936 A:middle
And this is how it translates

00:33:42.936 --> 00:33:43.966 A:middle
into traditional Chinese.

00:33:45.496 --> 00:33:46.376 A:middle
There are a couple of issues

00:33:46.916 --> 00:33:47.000 A:middle
here.

00:33:48.936 --> 00:33:51.426 A:middle
Mars is italicized in English.

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:54.126 A:middle
It's not italicized in Chinese.

00:33:54.336 --> 00:33:54.696 A:middle
Why?

00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:56.716 A:middle
Because italicization is not a

00:33:56.716 --> 00:33:57.726 A:middle
concept in Chinese.

00:33:57.856 --> 00:33:58.926 A:middle
And it's not a concept in,

00:33:58.926 --> 00:34:00.596 A:middle
actually, most scripts outside
