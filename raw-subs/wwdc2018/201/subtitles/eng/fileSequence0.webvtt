My name is Joaquim.

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:33.836 A:middle
I don't think I have to

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:34.926 A:middle

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:39.706 A:middle

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.346 A:middle
I'm going to do a brief

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:44.476 A:middle
introduction, like I started

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:44.866 A:middle
doing.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:46.856 A:middle

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:50.976 A:middle
And also, cover some really fun

00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:54.636 A:middle
