00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:00.306 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:24:01.056 --> 00:24:01.866 A:middle
Let's talk about text.

00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:06.546 A:middle
At Apple, a high quality

00:24:06.546 --> 00:24:08.096 A:middle
typographical experience is a

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:09.786 A:middle
key part of our design process.

00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:13.906 A:middle
And it's very important to us

00:24:14.356 --> 00:24:17.486 A:middle
how text looks on screen and how

00:24:17.486 --> 00:24:18.166 A:middle
it's designed.

00:24:19.336 --> 00:24:21.446 A:middle
And also, the way that it

00:24:21.446 --> 00:24:23.216 A:middle
translates to other languages.

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:29.016 A:middle
So, let me walk you through some

00:24:29.196 --> 00:24:30.806 A:middle
key aspects that we keep in mind

00:24:30.806 --> 00:24:32.346 A:middle
when we localize our own apps

00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:33.246 A:middle
into other languages.

00:24:33.656 --> 00:24:34.886 A:middle
And how you can take advantage

00:24:34.886 --> 00:24:36.416 A:middle
of these things to make your

00:24:36.656 --> 00:24:37.886 A:middle
apps look great in other

00:24:37.886 --> 00:24:38.316 A:middle
languages.

00:24:41.226 --> 00:24:42.616 A:middle
Now, I'm going to talk about

00:24:42.616 --> 00:24:44.426 A:middle
three main topics, set up some

00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:45.866 A:middle
fundamentals with languages and

00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:46.126 A:middle
scripts.

00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:48.356 A:middle
And then, dive into typefaces

00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:49.026 A:middle
and styles.

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:51.176 A:middle
Let's talk about languages and

00:24:51.796 --> 00:24:52.000 A:middle
scripts.

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:56.276 A:middle
What is a script?

00:24:56.556 --> 00:24:57.966 A:middle
So, when I'm talking about

00:24:57.966 --> 00:24:59.026 A:middle
script, I don't mean a Bash

00:24:59.026 --> 00:25:00.206 A:middle
script or a Python script.
