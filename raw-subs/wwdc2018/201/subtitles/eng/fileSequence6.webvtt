00:05:59.536 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
books, most books published in

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:03.196 A:middle
traditional Chinese and Japanese

00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:05.206 A:middle
are presented in vertical and

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:05.876 A:middle
right to left.

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:07.436 A:middle
And so, knowing about these

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:09.886 A:middle
formats and knowing about the

00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:10.886 A:middle
context in which it's

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:12.396 A:middle
appropriate to present these and

00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:13.856 A:middle
adapting your layout for these

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:15.476 A:middle
could be an important aspect of

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:15.836 A:middle
your app.

00:06:16.406 --> 00:06:18.186 A:middle
And are why frameworks alongside

00:06:18.186 --> 00:06:19.806 A:middle
our text frameworks like TextKit

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:21.566 A:middle
and CoreText can help you make

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:22.486 A:middle
sure you're doing the right

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.076 A:middle
thing in every single one of

00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:24.666 A:middle
these cases.

00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:29.516 A:middle
Going a little bit higher level,

00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:31.156 A:middle
even things like names.

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:32.966 A:middle
Depending on where you grew up,

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:34.496 A:middle
you might have a first, middle,

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:35.196 A:middle
and last name.

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.276 A:middle
Or a family name that comes

00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:38.906 A:middle
before your given name.

00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:40.856 A:middle
And again, knowing how to

00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:42.416 A:middle
present these, and even asking

00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:44.376 A:middle
your user about these could be a

00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:45.526 A:middle
crucial part of your app.

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:47.276 A:middle
And this is something that users

00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:49.596 A:middle
expect that you get right and

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:50.936 A:middle
know about the details and

00:06:51.206 --> 00:06:52.906 A:middle
intricacies of formatting names.

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:54.116 A:middle
And we have

00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:55.546 A:middle
PersonNameComponentsFormatter

00:06:55.546 --> 00:06:57.216 A:middle
API that help you do this.
