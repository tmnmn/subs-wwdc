00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:00.656 A:middle
There are so many things to

00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:02.496 A:middle
cover there from the decimal

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:03.836 A:middle
separator to the thousand

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:04.326 A:middle
separator.

00:05:04.326 --> 00:05:06.076 A:middle
And even, the entire class of

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:07.986 A:middle
digits used to represent and

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:08.936 A:middle
talk about numbers.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.526 A:middle
These can change between

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:10.986 A:middle
regions.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.196 A:middle
And if you use number

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:13.876 A:middle
formatters, your app gets this

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.036 A:middle
behavior for free.

00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:17.156 A:middle
And this is important not only

00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:18.996 A:middle
for consistency, but also,

00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:19.766 A:middle
understandability.

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:24.866 A:middle
Text is, also, another great

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.896 A:middle
topic with many different areas.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.716 A:middle
And depending on the language or

00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.386 A:middle
languages that you grew up

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:32.846 A:middle
learning and writing, and the

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:34.086 A:middle
scripts that those language are

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:34.606 A:middle
written in.

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:35.896 A:middle
You might have thought that

00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:36.976 A:middle
there are some properties that

00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:38.946 A:middle
are completely immutable across

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:39.866 A:middle
other scripts and other

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:40.516 A:middle
languages.

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:42.296 A:middle
And that might not, necessarily,

00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:42.606 A:middle
hold.

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:44.246 A:middle
One example, probably the

00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:45.476 A:middle
biggest example, is script

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:46.356 A:middle
directionality.

00:05:46.356 --> 00:05:48.046 A:middle
So, some languages, like Arabic

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:49.706 A:middle
and Hebrew, and in this case

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:51.536 A:middle
Urdu, are written and read from

00:05:51.536 --> 00:05:52.196 A:middle
right to left.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:53.756 A:middle
Which, is completely the other

00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:55.406 A:middle
way from English, from what you

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:56.116 A:middle
might be used to.

00:05:57.026 --> 00:05:59.536 A:middle
And taking this further, many

00:05:59.536 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
books, most books published in
