00:16:58.326 --> 00:17:00.136 A:middle
going to select the first, the

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:01.026 A:middle
same Bounded String

00:17:01.026 --> 00:17:02.156 A:middle
Pseudolanguage we just used.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:02.886 A:middle
Great.

00:17:03.896 --> 00:17:06.296 A:middle
Because we don't have the fixed

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:07.935 A:middle
width constraint, anymore, our

00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:08.935 A:middle
Browse button can now

00:17:08.935 --> 00:17:11.256 A:middle
accommodate a slightly longer

00:17:12.195 --> 00:17:12.346 A:middle
string.

00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:13.586 A:middle
Another very useful

00:17:13.586 --> 00:17:14.925 A:middle
pseudolanguage is the Double

00:17:14.925 --> 00:17:15.816 A:middle
Length Pseudolanguage.

00:17:16.425 --> 00:17:18.096 A:middle
It's for verifying your layout

00:17:18.096 --> 00:17:19.756 A:middle
against potential languages that

00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:21.636 A:middle
have longer string length, like

00:17:21.636 --> 00:17:23.506 A:middle
German, Finnish, or Russian.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.046 A:middle
They can sometimes be two times

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:26.925 A:middle
longer than English.

00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:28.806 A:middle
Let's see if that works.

00:17:29.476 --> 00:17:32.096 A:middle
Now, the Browse button is still

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:32.426 A:middle
okay.

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.306 A:middle
But our tag line is clipped by

00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:35.116 A:middle
the screen boundaries.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
When I select the label, I can

00:17:38.076 --> 00:17:39.766 A:middle
see that we only have a center X

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:40.306 A:middle
constraint.

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:42.276 A:middle
We don't have any leading or

00:17:42.276 --> 00:17:43.976 A:middle
trailing space constraint, so

00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:45.516 A:middle
that the label can overflow.

00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:48.216 A:middle
Let's add a leading space

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:50.026 A:middle
constraint to fix that.

00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:51.586 A:middle
Again, I'm holding down the

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:54.226 A:middle
Control key, drag from the label

00:17:54.226 --> 00:17:56.176 A:middle
to [inaudible] view, and select

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:57.676 A:middle
Leading Space to Safe Area.

00:17:57.676 --> 00:18:01.416 A:middle
I can select the constraint to
