00:19:59.596 --> 00:20:01.466 A:middle
UITableView and other standard

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:02.366 A:middle
UIKit components.

00:20:03.216 --> 00:20:04.526 A:middle
The system had done the hard

00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:05.486 A:middle
work for us.

00:20:06.076 --> 00:20:07.806 A:middle
All the section titles are now

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:09.206 A:middle
at the right side, which is the

00:20:09.206 --> 00:20:10.456 A:middle
leading side for right to left.

00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:12.756 A:middle
The chevrons here are at the

00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:14.086 A:middle
left side, which is the trailing

00:20:14.086 --> 00:20:14.386 A:middle
side.

00:20:15.596 --> 00:20:17.326 A:middle
I'm going to go to Jupiter, this

00:20:17.326 --> 00:20:17.586 A:middle
time.

00:20:19.046 --> 00:20:20.976 A:middle
And you may notice that the Back

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:22.556 A:middle
button is now at the top right

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.356 A:middle
corner, instead of top left.

00:20:25.306 --> 00:20:26.966 A:middle
That is, actually, very natural

00:20:26.966 --> 00:20:28.046 A:middle
for right to left languages.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.596 A:middle
Let's select a location on

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.000 A:middle
Jupiter.

00:20:32.626 --> 00:20:35.206 A:middle
So, here's our Travel Details

00:20:35.206 --> 00:20:35.516 A:middle
page.

00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:37.436 A:middle
Everything seems to be okay,

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:38.966 A:middle
except the stepper and the

00:20:38.966 --> 00:20:39.706 A:middle
Traveler label.

00:20:40.546 --> 00:20:41.816 A:middle
The first issue is that the

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:42.966 A:middle
stepper should be at the

00:20:42.966 --> 00:20:44.456 A:middle
trailing side, which is the left

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:45.376 A:middle
side for right to left.

00:20:46.126 --> 00:20:47.506 A:middle
The Traveler label should be at

00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:48.616 A:middle
the leading side, which is the

00:20:48.616 --> 00:20:49.306 A:middle
right side, here.

00:20:50.076 --> 00:20:51.996 A:middle
And also, there's an unnecessary

00:20:51.996 --> 00:20:53.646 A:middle
spacing for the Traveler label.

00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:56.186 A:middle
Let's fix that in that Interface

00:20:56.186 --> 00:20:56.486 A:middle
Builder.

00:20:57.106 --> 00:21:01.756 A:middle
Let me locate our trouble zone
