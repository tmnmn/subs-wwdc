00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.596 A:middle
These are some examples of the

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:03.006 A:middle
Formatter APIs that I talked

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:03.306 A:middle
about.

00:08:03.376 --> 00:08:04.906 A:middle
And we've, also, got some great

00:08:04.906 --> 00:08:05.926 A:middle
sessions that go into great

00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:07.896 A:middle
detail on how to further tailor

00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:09.316 A:middle
these for your app, as well.

00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:14.276 A:middle
So, let's start our first deep

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:16.746 A:middle
dive in to layout and some of

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:17.726 A:middle
the goals related to

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:19.326 A:middle
internationalization when it

00:08:19.326 --> 00:08:20.986 A:middle
comes to adaptive layouts.

00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:24.656 A:middle
Because, really, the core goal

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:27.096 A:middle
of an adaptive layout is to

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:29.236 A:middle
present all kinds of different

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:29.856 A:middle
information.

00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:31.806 A:middle
And when you're adapting your

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:33.876 A:middle
application for other languages,

00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:36.056 A:middle
probably, the biggest guarantee

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:37.126 A:middle
that you'll get is that these

00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:38.126 A:middle
translation lengths are going to

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:38.635 A:middle
be different.

00:08:39.145 --> 00:08:40.226 A:middle
They're going to be much shorter

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:41.525 A:middle
or much longer, depending on the

00:08:41.525 --> 00:08:42.086 A:middle
language.

00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:44.236 A:middle
And this is something that your

00:08:44.236 --> 00:08:45.546 A:middle
design and layout should adapt

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:45.866 A:middle
for.

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:49.466 A:middle
On top of this, there's also

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:50.846 A:middle
directionality, like I mentioned

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:51.286 A:middle
before.

00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:53.306 A:middle
Because some languages are

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:54.876 A:middle
written in right to left this

00:08:54.876 --> 00:08:56.656 A:middle
has some design considerations,

00:08:56.996 --> 00:08:58.106 A:middle
not just in the text that you

00:08:58.106 --> 00:08:59.866 A:middle
have in your app, but also, the

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:01.146 A:middle
way you present information.
