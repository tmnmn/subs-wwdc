00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:01.496 A:middle
I can see that there's a wording

00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:02.746 A:middle
in Xcode.

00:16:04.956 --> 00:16:06.656 A:middle
The wording shows that we have a

00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:08.476 A:middle
fixed width constraint and that

00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:09.266 A:middle
may cause clipping.

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:11.816 A:middle
If I want to know more

00:16:11.816 --> 00:16:13.256 A:middle
information, I can click on the

00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:13.736 A:middle
I button.

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:15.976 A:middle
I'm going to fix the issue by

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.766 A:middle
click the growth, sorry.

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:19.166 A:middle
By click the Warning sign.

00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:21.006 A:middle
Here are three options.

00:16:21.216 --> 00:16:22.326 A:middle
I'm going to select the first

00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:23.876 A:middle
one, which is simply remove the

00:16:23.876 --> 00:16:25.606 A:middle
constraint to allow the button

00:16:25.606 --> 00:16:26.846 A:middle
to be wider when there's more

00:16:26.846 --> 00:16:27.276 A:middle
content.

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:28.926 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:30.286 A:middle
Okay.

00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:31.366 A:middle
No other layout issues.

00:16:31.816 --> 00:16:33.926 A:middle
And then, I'm going to show you

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.686 A:middle
a very simple way to verify the

00:16:35.686 --> 00:16:36.636 A:middle
change that was made.

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:39.326 A:middle
I'm going to go to the Assistant

00:16:39.326 --> 00:16:40.726 A:middle
Editor at the top right corner,

00:16:40.986 --> 00:16:41.866 A:middle
the middle button here.

00:16:42.426 --> 00:16:46.426 A:middle
Here I can select Preview and

00:16:46.426 --> 00:16:47.466 A:middle
Main tell Storyboard.

00:16:48.756 --> 00:16:50.546 A:middle
The Preview pane allows you to

00:16:50.546 --> 00:16:52.236 A:middle
view your layout in multiple

00:16:52.306 --> 00:16:53.766 A:middle
screen sizes and different

00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:54.926 A:middle
languages without running the

00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:55.166 A:middle
app.

00:16:56.696 --> 00:16:58.106 A:middle
On the bottom right corner, I'm

00:16:58.326 --> 00:17:00.136 A:middle
