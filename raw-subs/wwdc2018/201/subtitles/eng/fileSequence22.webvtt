00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:00.516 A:middle
Now, my two views are inside

00:22:00.516 --> 00:22:01.416 A:middle
this UIStackView.

00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:03.446 A:middle
The only thing left is to add

00:22:03.446 --> 00:22:04.846 A:middle
constraints to the Stack View

00:22:04.846 --> 00:22:05.416 A:middle
itself.

00:22:05.416 --> 00:22:08.236 A:middle
I'm going to select Stack View,

00:22:08.846 --> 00:22:10.276 A:middle
click the Add Constraints

00:22:10.316 --> 00:22:10.596 A:middle
button.

00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:13.556 A:middle
I'm entering four zeros, here,

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:15.276 A:middle
because I want the Stack View to

00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:17.096 A:middle
fill the table view cell as much

00:22:17.096 --> 00:22:17.716 A:middle
as possible.

00:22:18.586 --> 00:22:20.166 A:middle
And I like to select the

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:21.516 A:middle
Constrain to margins here,

00:22:22.026 --> 00:22:23.276 A:middle
because I want some default

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:24.346 A:middle
margins for the Stack View.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.176 A:middle
And I want the leading edge to

00:22:26.176 --> 00:22:28.006 A:middle
align with the cell separators.

00:22:28.566 --> 00:22:29.776 A:middle
And add four constraints.

00:22:30.856 --> 00:22:31.356 A:middle
There you go.

00:22:32.816 --> 00:22:34.516 A:middle
And I'm going to verify my

00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:34.896 A:middle
change.

00:22:39.266 --> 00:22:39.446 A:middle
Yep.

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:40.086 A:middle
Browse.

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:42.916 A:middle
This time, I'd like to visit

00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:43.116 A:middle
Earth.

00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:46.046 A:middle
And I'd like to go through

00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:47.896 A:middle
Lisbon, Portugal, to visit

00:22:47.896 --> 00:22:48.656 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:52.576 A:middle
Do that. Now, as you can see,

00:22:52.576 --> 00:22:54.486 A:middle
because our Traveler label and

00:22:54.486 --> 00:22:55.946 A:middle
the stepper is now inside a

00:22:55.946 --> 00:22:57.656 A:middle
UIStackView, we get right to

00:22:57.656 --> 00:22:58.676 A:middle
left support for free.

00:22:59.626 --> 00:23:02.246 A:middle
Let's book this travel.
