00:35:58.596 --> 00:36:00.766 A:middle
use something like using a

00:36:02.016 --> 00:36:02.666 A:middle
different color.

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:04.966 A:middle
For example, here we use black

00:36:04.966 --> 00:36:07.146 A:middle
color for the math segment and

00:36:07.226 --> 00:36:08.206 A:middle
gray for the remainder of the

00:36:08.206 --> 00:36:08.486 A:middle
word.

00:36:08.936 --> 00:36:09.926 A:middle
This works really well.

00:36:10.566 --> 00:36:13.866 A:middle
Now, you'll see some dotted

00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:15.626 A:middle
circles on the keyboard.

00:36:15.696 --> 00:36:16.786 A:middle
That's perfectly fine.

00:36:16.886 --> 00:36:18.416 A:middle
They're dependent marks.

00:36:21.906 --> 00:36:24.196 A:middle
And here's the same example in

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:24.646 A:middle
Arabic.

00:36:25.146 --> 00:36:26.986 A:middle
Again, the same approach is used

00:36:27.046 --> 00:36:28.836 A:middle
all over iOS and macOS, and it

00:36:28.836 --> 00:36:30.496 A:middle
works really well for many

00:36:30.496 --> 00:36:30.966 A:middle
purposes.

00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:34.306 A:middle
And I should also mention that

00:36:34.306 --> 00:36:36.336 A:middle
this is really easy to do with

00:36:36.336 --> 00:36:37.500 A:middle
attributed strings.

00:36:40.596 --> 00:36:43.676 A:middle
Finally, let's go over

00:36:43.676 --> 00:36:44.566 A:middle
everything that we've talked

00:36:44.566 --> 00:36:44.876 A:middle
about.

00:36:48.576 --> 00:36:50.456 A:middle
First off, it's important to

00:36:50.766 --> 00:36:52.356 A:middle
start planning early in your

00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:54.806 A:middle
apps, not only the development,

00:36:54.906 --> 00:36:56.096 A:middle
but also, the design phase.

00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:00.776 A:middle
Once you know the languages
