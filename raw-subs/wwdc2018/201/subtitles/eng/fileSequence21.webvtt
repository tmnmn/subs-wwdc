00:20:57.106 --> 00:21:01.756 A:middle
Let me locate our trouble zone

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.056 A:middle
cell, is here.

00:21:04.336 --> 00:21:04.486 A:middle
Okay.

00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:08.926 A:middle
Zooming in a little bit.

00:21:09.536 --> 00:21:12.486 A:middle
When I select the Traveler label

00:21:12.486 --> 00:21:14.596 A:middle
and the stepper I can see that

00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:15.906 A:middle
there's no constraint on them.

00:21:16.186 --> 00:21:16.876 A:middle
That's not good.

00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:19.236 A:middle
And of course, Xcode has a

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.006 A:middle
warning for that.

00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:22.906 A:middle
So, one way to resolve the issue

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.196 A:middle
is to add a leading space

00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:26.086 A:middle
constraint for the Travelers and

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:27.526 A:middle
a trailing space constraint for

00:21:27.526 --> 00:21:28.046 A:middle
the stepper.

00:21:28.896 --> 00:21:30.266 A:middle
Leading and Trailing will

00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:32.246 A:middle
translate to right and left for

00:21:32.246 --> 00:21:33.156 A:middle
right to left languages.

00:21:34.186 --> 00:21:35.896 A:middle
However, here I'm going to show

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.866 A:middle
you an even simpler way, which

00:21:37.866 --> 00:21:40.086 A:middle
is to use UIStackView, a

00:21:40.086 --> 00:21:41.656 A:middle
high-level container view that

00:21:41.656 --> 00:21:43.246 A:middle
uses Auto Layout under the hood.

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:45.876 A:middle
By using Stack View I can get

00:21:45.876 --> 00:21:47.286 A:middle
right to left support for free.

00:21:47.746 --> 00:21:49.786 A:middle
Let me select the two views.

00:21:50.836 --> 00:21:53.566 A:middle
And click the Embed down here at

00:21:53.566 --> 00:21:54.796 A:middle
the bottom right corner.

00:21:56.276 --> 00:21:58.876 A:middle
Select Stack View.

00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:00.516 A:middle
Now, my two views are inside
