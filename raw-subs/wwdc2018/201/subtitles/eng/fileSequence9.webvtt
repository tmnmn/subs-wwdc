00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:01.146 A:middle
way you present information.

00:09:01.446 --> 00:09:03.026 A:middle
Especially, horizontally flowing

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:05.136 A:middle
information and how that general

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:06.846 A:middle
flow should adapt for both

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:10.966 A:middle
script and writing directions.

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:13.236 A:middle
So, a great starting point to

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:14.716 A:middle
help you do all of this is Auto

00:09:14.716 --> 00:09:15.066 A:middle
Layout.

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:16.226 A:middle
You might have heard of Auto

00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:16.916 A:middle
Layout, before.

00:09:17.686 --> 00:09:19.116 A:middle
This is a powerful technology

00:09:19.116 --> 00:09:20.266 A:middle
that is at the core of our

00:09:20.266 --> 00:09:20.966 A:middle
layout engine.

00:09:21.736 --> 00:09:23.006 A:middle
And Auto Layout, instead of

00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:26.026 A:middle
describing explicit frames or

00:09:26.116 --> 00:09:27.606 A:middle
positions of your controls and

00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:30.286 A:middle
labels, describes constraints or

00:09:30.286 --> 00:09:31.586 A:middle
relationships between these

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:32.016 A:middle
views.

00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:33.666 A:middle
And therefore, how they're

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:34.876 A:middle
positioned relative to each

00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:36.216 A:middle
other and how they're allowed to

00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.866 A:middle
grow relative to each other.

00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:41.686 A:middle
On top of this constraint-based

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:43.466 A:middle
system we have the idea of

00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:44.356 A:middle
leading and trailing

00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:45.036 A:middle
constraints.

00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:46.976 A:middle
And what this means is that

00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:48.466 A:middle
this, essentially, describes

00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:50.166 A:middle
properties that are left and

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:51.896 A:middle
right in a language like English

00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:54.376 A:middle
that automatically evaluate to

00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:56.486 A:middle
right and left, respectively, in

00:09:56.486 --> 00:09:57.596 A:middle
a language like Arabic and

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:57.966 A:middle
Hebrew.

00:09:58.696 --> 00:09:59.806 A:middle
And this means that with Auto

00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:01.336 A:middle
Layout you can create these
