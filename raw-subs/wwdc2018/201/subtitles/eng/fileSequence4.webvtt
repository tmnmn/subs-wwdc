00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:04.226 A:middle
for business.

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:05.716 A:middle
And these all have different

00:04:05.716 --> 00:04:07.726 A:middle
properties like leap months and

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:09.506 A:middle
leap years and different numbers

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:10.636 A:middle
of days and different numbers of

00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:11.096 A:middle
months.

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:14.136 A:middle
And so, being precise about

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:15.976 A:middle
these and knowing how to present

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:17.976 A:middle
these appropriately means being

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:19.125 A:middle
internationally aware.

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:21.706 A:middle
This is an example of the iOS

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:23.956 A:middle
Calendar app showing the Chinese

00:04:23.956 --> 00:04:25.456 A:middle
Lunar calendar on top of the

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:26.416 A:middle
Gregorian calendar.

00:04:27.056 --> 00:04:28.446 A:middle
And we have a set of API's in

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:30.236 A:middle
Calendar and alongside Date

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:31.956 A:middle
Formatter that help you do this.

00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:36.446 A:middle
Could also talk about units and

00:04:36.446 --> 00:04:37.006 A:middle
measurements.

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:39.376 A:middle
Whether it's presenting things

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:41.076 A:middle
in the metric versus the

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:43.126 A:middle
imperial system, or even

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:45.176 A:middle
temperatures like Celsius or

00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:45.666 A:middle
Fahrenheit.

00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:47.716 A:middle
Your app should be aware of the

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.036 A:middle
appropriate regional defaults

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:51.356 A:middle
for these, and also, respond to

00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:52.336 A:middle
changes in the user's

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:52.886 A:middle
preference.

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:57.326 A:middle
And not only that, whether

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:58.846 A:middle
they're units or not, even

00:04:58.846 --> 00:04:59.696 A:middle
numbers themselves.
