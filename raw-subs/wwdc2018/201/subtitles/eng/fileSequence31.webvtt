00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:02.726 A:middle
And the key concept that I want

00:31:02.726 --> 00:31:03.976 A:middle
to introduce you to, here, is

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:05.286 A:middle
called a Cascade List.

00:31:05.856 --> 00:31:08.746 A:middle
So, a Cascade List says if I'm

00:31:08.746 --> 00:31:11.326 A:middle
looking to render this Chinese

00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:14.086 A:middle
character and this first font

00:31:14.086 --> 00:31:15.796 A:middle
doesn't have it, what font

00:31:15.796 --> 00:31:17.396 A:middle
should I use after this to look

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:18.166 A:middle
for this character?

00:31:18.556 --> 00:31:19.666 A:middle
Now, if you don't specify a

00:31:19.666 --> 00:31:20.876 A:middle
Cascade List you're going to get

00:31:20.876 --> 00:31:21.606 A:middle
the system font.

00:31:22.066 --> 00:31:23.376 A:middle
But if you do have a Cascade

00:31:23.376 --> 00:31:24.646 A:middle
List, then you can specify other

00:31:24.646 --> 00:31:26.426 A:middle
fonts to try before falling back

00:31:26.646 --> 00:31:27.446 A:middle
to the system font.

00:31:28.426 --> 00:31:29.526 A:middle
So, in this case, we create a

00:31:29.526 --> 00:31:30.586 A:middle
Cascade List with a font

00:31:30.586 --> 00:31:32.096 A:middle
descriptor for our font for

00:31:32.096 --> 00:31:34.046 A:middle
Chinese that we hand-picked.

00:31:34.836 --> 00:31:36.306 A:middle
Now, if your app supports

00:31:36.306 --> 00:31:37.316 A:middle
multiple scripts you add

00:31:37.316 --> 00:31:39.036 A:middle
multiple things here and that's

00:31:39.286 --> 00:31:40.516 A:middle
as simple as it works.

00:31:41.616 --> 00:31:43.056 A:middle
And once you've got a Cascade

00:31:43.056 --> 00:31:44.046 A:middle
List you create a new font

00:31:44.046 --> 00:31:44.556 A:middle
descriptor.

00:31:44.556 --> 00:31:45.656 A:middle
And then, you create a new font.

00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:46.566 A:middle
Pretty straightforward.

00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:50.136 A:middle
And also, make sure that if your

00:31:50.136 --> 00:31:51.846 A:middle
app used dynamic type, which it

00:31:51.846 --> 00:31:54.506 A:middle
really should, then your font

00:31:54.506 --> 00:31:55.706 A:middle
should adjust to that, as well.

00:31:55.706 --> 00:31:57.066 A:middle
And again, that's as simple as

00:31:57.066 --> 00:31:57.736 A:middle
an API call.

00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:00.286 A:middle
Let's see some examples.
