00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:00.296 A:middle
Internationalization is a

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:01.886 A:middle
crucial concept and we're going

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:02.956 A:middle
to go over some of the details

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.885 A:middle
as to why it applies to every

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:06.146 A:middle
single app, regardless of the

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:07.086 A:middle
set of languages that you

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:07.596 A:middle
support.

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:10.776 A:middle
And once again, this is all

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.006 A:middle
about reaching out to more

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:12.426 A:middle
people.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.106 A:middle
It's enabling everybody to learn

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.146 A:middle
about and use your app.

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.826 A:middle
Regardless of the language they

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.166 A:middle
speak or the country that they

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.626 A:middle
live in, or the country that

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:20.176 A:middle
they grew up in.

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:21.746 A:middle
And it's important to note that

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:23.176 A:middle
those last two might be

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:23.946 A:middle
different, as well.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:24.936 A:middle
And that's something that's

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:25.886 A:middle
worth keeping in mind.

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.676 A:middle
So, internationalization covers

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:32.446 A:middle
a wide range of topics, and

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:34.116 A:middle
potentially, every single aspect

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:35.066 A:middle
of your app.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:36.736 A:middle
And if you're new to the topic,

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:38.596 A:middle
probably, the best way to think

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.126 A:middle
about it is that

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:41.536 A:middle
internationalization is best

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:43.546 A:middle
applied as a constant process.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.116 A:middle
It's a discussion that belongs

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:46.386 A:middle
in every single stage of your

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:47.386 A:middle
app.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:48.846 A:middle
Whether it's the initial

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:51.306 A:middle
inception, its design, to its

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:52.446 A:middle
implementation, and even

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.726 A:middle
distributing it on the App

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:54.106 A:middle
Store.

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:55.496 A:middle
Things like your App Store

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:56.936 A:middle
screenshots and even your app's

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.426 A:middle
name should be open for

00:01:58.426 --> 00:01:59.976 A:middle
discussion in an international

00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:00.606 A:middle
context.
