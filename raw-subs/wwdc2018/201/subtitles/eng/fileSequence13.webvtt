00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:01.326 A:middle
a pseudolanguage and this

00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:03.466 A:middle
changes a few details of the

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:04.616 A:middle
layout and text of your app.

00:13:05.246 --> 00:13:06.346 A:middle
One example is the bounded

00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:07.596 A:middle
string pseudolanguage.

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.156 A:middle
This adds a few characters at

00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:10.966 A:middle
the beginning and end of every

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:12.066 A:middle
single UI string that you

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:12.466 A:middle
display.

00:13:13.066 --> 00:13:15.496 A:middle
And then, you can see, make sure

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:17.506 A:middle
that there aren't truncations or

00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:18.736 A:middle
unexpected clippings in the

00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:19.506 A:middle
content of your app.

00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:20.836 A:middle
So, this is a really useful one.

00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:21.906 A:middle
And we have many more

00:13:21.906 --> 00:13:23.006 A:middle
pseudolanguages that can help

00:13:23.006 --> 00:13:25.996 A:middle
you out, as well.

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:28.336 A:middle
Specifically, for Auto Layout we

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:31.326 A:middle
have Auto Layout warnings built

00:13:31.326 --> 00:13:31.916 A:middle
into Xcode.

00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:33.786 A:middle
So, Xcode can tell you about

00:13:33.786 --> 00:13:35.786 A:middle
common antipatterns right within

00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:36.596 A:middle
an interface builder.

00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:38.056 A:middle
And this can be things like

00:13:38.356 --> 00:13:40.406 A:middle
fixed width constraints or too

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:41.896 A:middle
few constraints on a control or

00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:43.606 A:middle
label that might, potentially,

00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:45.686 A:middle
introduce issues at runtime,

00:13:45.836 --> 00:13:47.186 A:middle
especially, in other languages.

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:52.076 A:middle
So, with that, I'd like to hand

00:13:52.076 --> 00:13:53.566 A:middle
it over to Dongyuan, who's going

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:55.016 A:middle
to give you a demo of all of

00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:55.676 A:middle
this in action.

00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:56.916 A:middle
Thank you, so much.

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:57.946 A:middle
And hope you have a great week.

00:13:58.226 --> 00:13:58.626 A:middle
Thank you, [inaudible].
