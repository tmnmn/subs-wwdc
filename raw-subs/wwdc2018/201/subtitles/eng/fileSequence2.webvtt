00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:00.606 A:middle
context.

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:04.206 A:middle
And like I said before, this

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:06.186 A:middle
covers a wide variety of topics.

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:10.006 A:middle
At Apple, we have a lot of

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:11.566 A:middle
firsthand experience about this.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:14.166 A:middle
So, we estimate that over 70% of

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.556 A:middle
our customers are outside of the

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:16.196 A:middle
United States.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.326 A:middle
And this means that when

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:20.186 A:middle
somebody downloads your app they

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:21.776 A:middle
expect that app to match your

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:22.816 A:middle
language preferences.

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:24.666 A:middle
And not only that, but also, be

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.116 A:middle
aware of any details that might

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:27.196 A:middle
be related to their region

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:28.166 A:middle
settings, as well.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:33.076 A:middle
We support exactly 38 different

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:36.176 A:middle
written languages and many, many

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.896 A:middle
more keyboards and input methods

00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:40.506 A:middle
for people to type and text.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.256 A:middle
And what this means for you, is

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:44.056 A:middle
you have a rock solid foundation

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:44.896 A:middle
to get started with.

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:47.076 A:middle
Every single one of our API's

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:48.696 A:middle
supports these languages and

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:49.276 A:middle
input methods.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:50.796 A:middle
And this means that you can get

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:52.116 A:middle
started right away by using

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:54.276 A:middle
these and you're off to a great

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.986 A:middle
start in providing really great

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.256 A:middle
international support to your

00:02:58.886 --> 00:02:58.966 A:middle
app.
