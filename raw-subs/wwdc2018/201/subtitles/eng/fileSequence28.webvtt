00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:00.946 A:middle
vacation look to it, which it

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:01.936 A:middle
doesn't right now, because

00:28:01.936 --> 00:28:02.816 A:middle
everything is in the system

00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:03.116 A:middle
font.

00:28:03.256 --> 00:28:05.266 A:middle
So, we decided that the title of

00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:06.706 A:middle
the font should evoke the

00:28:06.706 --> 00:28:07.616 A:middle
personality of the app.

00:28:08.996 --> 00:28:10.096 A:middle
And so, we looked at a few

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:11.496 A:middle
different fun fonts to choose

00:28:11.496 --> 00:28:11.786 A:middle
from.

00:28:13.096 --> 00:28:14.006 A:middle
We looked at this one, for

00:28:14.006 --> 00:28:14.486 A:middle
starters.

00:28:14.956 --> 00:28:16.636 A:middle
But as Joaquim mentioned from

00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:18.436 A:middle
the start, we like to keep

00:28:18.626 --> 00:28:20.486 A:middle
localization as a central part

00:28:20.486 --> 00:28:21.736 A:middle
of our development and design

00:28:22.056 --> 00:28:22.556 A:middle
process.

00:28:22.806 --> 00:28:24.556 A:middle
So, the first thing we did was

00:28:25.316 --> 00:28:26.796 A:middle
to check does this work for all

00:28:26.796 --> 00:28:27.556 A:middle
the languages we need to

00:28:27.556 --> 00:28:28.006 A:middle
support?

00:28:28.096 --> 00:28:29.616 A:middle
Well, we already had a French

00:28:29.616 --> 00:28:30.326 A:middle
localization.

00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:31.516 A:middle
So, we tried it out.

00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:33.976 A:middle
As it turns out, it doesn't.

00:28:34.656 --> 00:28:37.076 A:middle
So, we kept looking at our short

00:28:37.076 --> 00:28:39.286 A:middle
list of options.

00:28:39.746 --> 00:28:40.846 A:middle
And we looked at this other

00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:41.326 A:middle
typeface.

00:28:42.396 --> 00:28:44.106 A:middle
And when we tried it out in

00:28:44.166 --> 00:28:45.576 A:middle
French, voila!

00:28:45.936 --> 00:28:47.496 A:middle
It works because it supports all

00:28:47.496 --> 00:28:48.256 A:middle
the characters needed for

00:28:48.256 --> 00:28:48.576 A:middle
French.

00:28:49.156 --> 00:28:49.946 A:middle
So, that's great news.

00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:54.416 A:middle
So, the next step for our app

00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:55.766 A:middle
was to expand to Vietnamese.

00:28:55.766 --> 00:28:57.556 A:middle
But we didn't have a Vietnamese

00:28:57.556 --> 00:28:58.486 A:middle
localization, yet.

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:01.356 A:middle
So, one great tool that you can
