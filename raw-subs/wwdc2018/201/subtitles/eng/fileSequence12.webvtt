00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:02.086 A:middle
If your labels and your controls

00:12:02.086 --> 00:12:04.026 A:middle
are either in stack views in

00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:05.236 A:middle
these high-level components that

00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:06.646 A:middle
I mentioned before, or

00:12:06.646 --> 00:12:07.896 A:middle
positioned using Auto Layout

00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:09.896 A:middle
itself, this work is pretty much

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:10.656 A:middle
done for you.

00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:11.796 A:middle
You're already allowing your

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:13.756 A:middle
labels to grow and your controls

00:12:13.756 --> 00:12:15.406 A:middle
to take up the content that they

00:12:15.406 --> 00:12:16.126 A:middle
need to take up.

00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:17.896 A:middle
And then, it just becomes a

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:19.866 A:middle
matter of prioritizing how you

00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:21.666 A:middle
want to let them grow relative

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.856 A:middle
to each other.

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.546 A:middle
So, this is great.

00:12:26.806 --> 00:12:28.106 A:middle
Let's say you've done all this.

00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:29.786 A:middle
And how, exactly, do you make

00:12:29.786 --> 00:12:31.356 A:middle
sure that your app is checking

00:12:31.356 --> 00:12:32.736 A:middle
off all the right boxes in terms

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:34.846 A:middle
of adaptive layout and

00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:36.016 A:middle
responding to all of these

00:12:36.016 --> 00:12:36.386 A:middle
things?

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.036 A:middle
Well, the good news is that

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:39.206 A:middle
Xcode provides a number of

00:12:39.206 --> 00:12:40.506 A:middle
features for you to test.

00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:42.906 A:middle
And not only that, it allows you

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:44.486 A:middle
to test early and find these out

00:12:44.526 --> 00:12:45.936 A:middle
quickly in the development, and

00:12:45.936 --> 00:12:47.086 A:middle
early on in the development of

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:47.446 A:middle
your app.

00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:50.056 A:middle
One example is pseudolanguages.

00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:51.636 A:middle
Pseudolanguages are great,

00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:53.516 A:middle
especially, when you haven't yet

00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:54.786 A:middle
added language support to your

00:12:54.786 --> 00:12:54.996 A:middle
app.

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:56.466 A:middle
So, what you can do from within

00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:59.746 A:middle
Xcode is run your application in

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:01.326 A:middle
a pseudolanguage and this
