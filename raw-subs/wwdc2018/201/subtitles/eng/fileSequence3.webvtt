00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:02.216 A:middle
So, for example, this might

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:04.406 A:middle
entail presenting dates and

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:05.256 A:middle
times.

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:05.796 A:middle
This wouldn't be an

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:06.876 A:middle
international talk if I didn't

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:07.976 A:middle
talk about dates and times.

00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:09.086 A:middle
But it's important to think

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:09.556 A:middle
about, right?

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.106 A:middle
Because people have different

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:12.386 A:middle
expectations around the world.

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:14.346 A:middle
This is the [inaudible] Sao

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:15.446 A:middle
Bento in Portugal.

00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:16.546 A:middle
It's a lovely train station.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.836 A:middle
But my focus today isn't so much

00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:21.506 A:middle
the train station as much as the

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:22.856 A:middle
way the times are presented in

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:23.596 A:middle
the train station.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.886 A:middle
And if you go there, you might

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:25.996 A:middle
notice that everything is in

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:27.056 A:middle
24-hour time.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.676 A:middle
And this is true, not just in

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.736 A:middle
train stations, but it's

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:32.776 A:middle
commonplace everywhere in many

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:33.366 A:middle
countries.

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:35.586 A:middle
And so, your app should know

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:37.756 A:middle
about these and present time

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:39.186 A:middle
accordingly, depending on the

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:39.476 A:middle
region.

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:41.196 A:middle
And you can do this using date

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:41.706 A:middle
formatter.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:43.216 A:middle
It's a set of APIs we provide

00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:44.066 A:middle
that lets you do this.

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:45.526 A:middle
And it really does all the heavy

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:46.866 A:middle
lifting for you.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.946 A:middle
Another example is calendars.

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:52.126 A:middle
There are many different

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:53.486 A:middle
calendrical systems around the

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:53.816 A:middle
world.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.416 A:middle
And it's also important to note

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:57.866 A:middle
that many people use more than

00:03:57.866 --> 00:03:59.466 A:middle
one on a daily basis.

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:01.546 A:middle
They might use one for religious
