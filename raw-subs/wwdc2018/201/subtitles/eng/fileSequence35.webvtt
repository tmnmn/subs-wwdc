00:35:01.476 --> 00:35:02.596 A:middle
Let's say we have an app with a

00:35:02.656 --> 00:35:04.696 A:middle
Search feature and we want to

00:35:04.696 --> 00:35:05.866 A:middle
highlight the part of the

00:35:05.866 --> 00:35:07.326 A:middle
results that matched to make it

00:35:07.326 --> 00:35:08.266 A:middle
clear to the user what's

00:35:08.266 --> 00:35:08.706 A:middle
happening.

00:35:09.636 --> 00:35:11.066 A:middle
Now, this works really well for

00:35:11.066 --> 00:35:13.756 A:middle
English, by using a bolder

00:35:13.756 --> 00:35:14.986 A:middle
weight for the matched segment.

00:35:15.676 --> 00:35:19.716 A:middle
It works really badly for Hindi.

00:35:20.226 --> 00:35:23.446 A:middle
So, what you're seeing here, so

00:35:23.476 --> 00:35:24.916 A:middle
anybody who can read Hindi will

00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:26.056 A:middle
tell you that everything on the

00:35:26.056 --> 00:35:27.176 A:middle
right-hand side looks completely

00:35:27.176 --> 00:35:27.596 A:middle
broken.

00:35:28.406 --> 00:35:31.096 A:middle
Any time you see a dotted circle

00:35:31.346 --> 00:35:33.646 A:middle
inside a Hindi word, something

00:35:33.646 --> 00:35:34.926 A:middle
has gone very, very wrong.

00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:37.396 A:middle
And the reason this is happening

00:35:37.796 --> 00:35:39.286 A:middle
is because even though it's the

00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:40.826 A:middle
same font family, different

00:35:40.826 --> 00:35:42.716 A:middle
weights within that font are,

00:35:42.716 --> 00:35:43.926 A:middle
actually, a different font.

00:35:44.326 --> 00:35:45.446 A:middle
And you can't have the

00:35:45.446 --> 00:35:46.996 A:middle
appropriate joining behavior for

00:35:46.996 --> 00:35:48.956 A:middle
languages like Hindi if you have

00:35:48.996 --> 00:35:49.836 A:middle
two different fonts.

00:35:51.466 --> 00:35:54.026 A:middle
So, one easy way to solve this

00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:55.856 A:middle
problem is use a different kind

00:35:55.856 --> 00:35:57.316 A:middle
of emphasis at a character

00:35:57.316 --> 00:35:57.526 A:middle
level.

00:35:57.526 --> 00:35:58.596 A:middle
So, at a character level you can

00:35:58.596 --> 00:36:00.766 A:middle
use something like using a
