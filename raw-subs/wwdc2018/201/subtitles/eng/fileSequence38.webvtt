00:37:58.766 --> 00:38:00.696 A:middle
here is that every localization

00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:02.266 A:middle
of your app is a unique

00:38:02.266 --> 00:38:02.866 A:middle
experience.

00:38:03.556 --> 00:38:05.456 A:middle
And you need to make sure that

00:38:05.456 --> 00:38:07.626 A:middle
your intent that you specified

00:38:07.686 --> 00:38:08.976 A:middle
in your development language

00:38:09.336 --> 00:38:10.706 A:middle
actually makes it over to all

00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:11.686 A:middle
the other languages that you

00:38:11.726 --> 00:38:12.176 A:middle
support.

00:38:12.176 --> 00:38:14.006 A:middle
And that nothing is lost along

00:38:14.006 --> 00:38:14.296 A:middle
the way.

00:38:15.946 --> 00:38:16.806 A:middle
Thank you, very much.
