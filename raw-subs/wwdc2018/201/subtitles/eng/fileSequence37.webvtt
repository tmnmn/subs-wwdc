00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:00.776 A:middle
Once you know the languages

00:37:00.776 --> 00:37:02.096 A:middle
you're going to localize into

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.246 A:middle
and plan to extend to in the

00:37:04.246 --> 00:37:06.796 A:middle
future, internationalize as you

00:37:06.796 --> 00:37:07.106 A:middle
go.

00:37:07.816 --> 00:37:09.746 A:middle
Technologies like Auto Layout,

00:37:09.966 --> 00:37:12.626 A:middle
StackViews, and dynamic type are

00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:14.536 A:middle
very simple to adopt while

00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:15.266 A:middle
you're in the process of

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:16.156 A:middle
building your feature.

00:37:16.586 --> 00:37:17.996 A:middle
But if you finish your project

00:37:17.996 --> 00:37:19.636 A:middle
and try to come back and use

00:37:19.636 --> 00:37:20.426 A:middle
them, then you may have to

00:37:20.426 --> 00:37:21.846 A:middle
completely rearchitect your app.

00:37:21.846 --> 00:37:24.206 A:middle
And that will be a lot of work.

00:37:25.486 --> 00:37:28.056 A:middle
If you're doing something for

00:37:28.056 --> 00:37:29.576 A:middle
which you feel, oh, yeah, there

00:37:29.576 --> 00:37:30.696 A:middle
should be an API for this,

00:37:30.696 --> 00:37:30.916 A:middle
right?

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.916 A:middle
There probably is an API for it.

00:37:33.316 --> 00:37:35.866 A:middle
So, make sure that when you're

00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:37.546 A:middle
doing something like formatting

00:37:37.546 --> 00:37:41.076 A:middle
any kind of data, to make sure

00:37:41.076 --> 00:37:42.096 A:middle
to look to see if there's a

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:42.906 A:middle
formatter class.

00:37:43.206 --> 00:37:44.276 A:middle
And also, make sure to look to

00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:45.706 A:middle
see if there is an API for

00:37:45.706 --> 00:37:46.776 A:middle
anything you're doing with text

00:37:47.576 --> 00:37:48.656 A:middle
before trying to ruin your own

00:37:48.656 --> 00:37:49.366 A:middle
implementation.

00:37:51.766 --> 00:37:55.266 A:middle
And lastly, ensure that nothing

00:37:55.266 --> 00:37:56.396 A:middle
is lost in translation.

00:37:56.676 --> 00:37:58.766 A:middle
So, the key thing to realize

00:37:58.766 --> 00:38:00.696 A:middle
here is that every localization
