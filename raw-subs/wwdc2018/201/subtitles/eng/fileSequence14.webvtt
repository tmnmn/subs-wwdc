00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:01.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Joaquim.

00:14:09.486 --> 00:14:10.376 A:middle
Hi, I'm Dongyuan.

00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:13.266 A:middle
Let me show you some techniques

00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:14.536 A:middle
to [inaudible] and some common

00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:16.136 A:middle
pitfalls to avoid in real world.

00:14:17.316 --> 00:14:18.706 A:middle
Here's an app called Vacation

00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:20.456 A:middle
Planet, which is the first

00:14:20.456 --> 00:14:23.416 A:middle
interplanetary travel agent that

00:14:23.416 --> 00:14:24.906 A:middle
allows you to book travel for

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.236 A:middle
not only other countries, but

00:14:26.496 --> 00:14:27.886 A:middle
also, as you can see in this

00:14:27.886 --> 00:14:29.186 A:middle
table view, other planets.

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:32.426 A:middle
So, I wanted to go to the moon

00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:33.956 A:middle
for quite a few times.

00:14:34.466 --> 00:14:35.446 A:middle
So, I can do that, this time.

00:14:36.896 --> 00:14:38.326 A:middle
And here are all the locations

00:14:38.326 --> 00:14:40.116 A:middle
available on the moon and their

00:14:40.116 --> 00:14:41.086 A:middle
distance from Earth.

00:14:42.246 --> 00:14:43.496 A:middle
Let me choose the location like

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:44.416 A:middle
the Clavius Base.

00:14:45.806 --> 00:14:47.496 A:middle
And here is our Travel Details

00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:47.766 A:middle
page.

00:14:48.906 --> 00:14:50.266 A:middle
It seems pretty cheap for one

00:14:50.266 --> 00:14:50.536 A:middle
trip.

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:51.836 A:middle
So, I'm going to buy more

00:14:51.836 --> 00:14:52.296 A:middle
tickets.

00:14:52.986 --> 00:14:54.886 A:middle
Let's buy three of them.

00:14:56.336 --> 00:14:57.216 A:middle
And there we go.

00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.286 A:middle
As you can see, because we
