00:33:58.926 --> 00:34:00.596 A:middle
actually, most scripts outside

00:34:00.596 --> 00:34:01.696 A:middle
of Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek.

00:34:03.406 --> 00:34:04.936 A:middle
So, a design that uses italics,

00:34:05.366 --> 00:34:06.186 A:middle
probably, won't work.

00:34:06.996 --> 00:34:08.886 A:middle
The other thing to note is that

00:34:08.886 --> 00:34:10.076 A:middle
in Chinese there are no spaces

00:34:10.076 --> 00:34:11.326 A:middle
between words, and also, there

00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:13.206 A:middle
is no concept of uppercase and

00:34:13.206 --> 00:34:13.936 A:middle
lowercase letters.

00:34:14.306 --> 00:34:15.626 A:middle
So, you kind of lose a natural

00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:17.085 A:middle
distinction that you get in

00:34:17.085 --> 00:34:18.485 A:middle
English when you translate it

00:34:19.326 --> 00:34:19.976 A:middle
into Chinese.

00:34:20.286 --> 00:34:21.985 A:middle
A couple of small things to

00:34:21.985 --> 00:34:23.255 A:middle
note, also, is that the word

00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:25.775 A:middle
order is different.

00:34:25.896 --> 00:34:27.406 A:middle
And also, because the 2 still

00:34:27.406 --> 00:34:29.106 A:middle
comes from the Latin script and

00:34:29.106 --> 00:34:30.646 A:middle
is still italicized, it doesn't

00:34:30.646 --> 00:34:31.806 A:middle
look great.

00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:34.315 A:middle
So, how can you fix this?

00:34:35.846 --> 00:34:38.346 A:middle
Well, the keys to realizing that

00:34:38.346 --> 00:34:39.755 A:middle
you're doing emphasis, not

00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:41.106 A:middle
necessarily italics.

00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:42.886 A:middle
And emphasis can be done in

00:34:42.886 --> 00:34:43.835 A:middle
multiple different ways.

00:34:44.045 --> 00:34:44.956 A:middle
This is a great way to do

00:34:44.956 --> 00:34:46.096 A:middle
emphasis that works across

00:34:46.186 --> 00:34:47.186 A:middle
several different languages.

00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:48.386 A:middle
In fact, it works for all the

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:49.926 A:middle
languages that we support, which

00:34:49.926 --> 00:34:52.636 A:middle
is to bold a given word.

00:34:53.166 --> 00:34:57.256 A:middle
Lastly, let's talk about

00:34:57.366 --> 00:34:58.866 A:middle
emphasis at a character level or

00:34:58.866 --> 00:34:59.916 A:middle
sub-word level.
