00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:01.076 A:middle
app in Hebrew, this is the

00:11:01.076 --> 00:11:01.796 A:middle
result I would get.

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:03.176 A:middle
Because that information would

00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:04.366 A:middle
adapt automatically.

00:11:04.616 --> 00:11:06.106 A:middle
Because StackView is aware of

00:11:06.106 --> 00:11:07.616 A:middle
these concepts and uses Auto

00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:07.926 A:middle
Layout

00:11:07.926 --> 00:11:09.026 A:middle
under the hood.

00:11:09.966 --> 00:11:11.936 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:14.586 A:middle
about Auto Layout and details on

00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:16.116 A:middle
how to adapt your application

00:11:16.116 --> 00:11:16.846 A:middle
for different writing

00:11:16.846 --> 00:11:18.436 A:middle
directions, these are some great

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:20.866 A:middle
starting points to check out, as

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:22.156 A:middle
well.

00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:25.596 A:middle
So, when it comes to the text in

00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:27.216 A:middle
your app and the content in your

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:29.156 A:middle
app the key goal here and,

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:30.456 A:middle
obviously, the number one

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.796 A:middle
recommendation is to simply not

00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:33.976 A:middle
assume fixed widths.

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:35.676 A:middle
If you don't do that you're off

00:11:35.676 --> 00:11:37.046 A:middle
to a great starting point in

00:11:37.046 --> 00:11:38.956 A:middle
terms of allowing your app to

00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:40.966 A:middle
adapt to, not only different

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.616 A:middle
changes in length horizontally.

00:11:42.616 --> 00:11:44.026 A:middle
But even, potentially, allow

00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:45.946 A:middle
your labels to grow vertically

00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:47.436 A:middle
and adapt to multiple lines if

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:48.016 A:middle
necessary.

00:11:48.746 --> 00:11:49.486 A:middle
And this is something you'll

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:51.036 A:middle
have to decide in your app and

00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:53.026 A:middle
your app's design on what you

00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:54.506 A:middle
want to prioritize in terms of

00:11:54.906 --> 00:11:56.546 A:middle
what is allowed to grow and use

00:11:56.546 --> 00:11:58.546 A:middle
up the real estate of your app.

00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:02.086 A:middle
If your labels and your controls
