00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:02.706 A:middle
So, again, we want to write a 2

00:11:02.706 --> 00:11:04.196 A:middle
by 2 group of pixels, and from

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.066 A:middle
that we need to read from a 4 by

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:07.186 A:middle
4 group of pixels.

00:11:07.826 --> 00:11:09.086 A:middle
So, the first thing we're going

00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:10.406 A:middle
to do is specify that we want a

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:11.346 A:middle
group destination.

00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:13.306 A:middle
If you look at the function

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:14.866 A:middle
declaration, it now has a group

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:17.286 A:middle
destination, H datatype.

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:19.106 A:middle
Then, we're going to get the

00:11:19.106 --> 00:11:20.246 A:middle
destination coordinate like we

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.606 A:middle
had before, and that will point

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:22.716 A:middle
to the center of a pixel.

00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:24.676 A:middle
However, that coordinate

00:11:24.676 --> 00:11:26.246 A:middle
actually represents the

00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:29.086 A:middle
coordinate of a group of 2 by 2

00:11:29.086 --> 00:11:29.596 A:middle
pixels.

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:32.006 A:middle
The next thing we're going to do

00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:34.636 A:middle
in order to fill in this 2 by 2

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:36.346 A:middle
group of pixels is do a bunch of

00:11:36.346 --> 00:11:37.196 A:middle
reads from the image.

00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:40.396 A:middle
So, the first gather read is

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:41.976 A:middle
going to read from a 2 by 2

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:43.816 A:middle
group of pixels -- in this case,

00:11:43.816 --> 00:11:45.306 A:middle
the lower left-hand corner of

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:46.456 A:middle
our 16.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.176 A:middle
And it's going to return the

00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:51.276 A:middle
value of the red channel in a

00:11:51.766 --> 00:11:53.596 A:middle
half-four array.

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:56.596 A:middle
The four parameters will be

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
stored in this order, which is

00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:01.126 A:middle
X, Y, Z, W going in a
