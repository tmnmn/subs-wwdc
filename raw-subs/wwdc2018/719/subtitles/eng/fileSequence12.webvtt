00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:01.126 A:middle
X, Y, Z, W going in a

00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:02.466 A:middle
counter-clockwise direction.

00:12:02.466 --> 00:12:04.006 A:middle
This is the same direction that

00:12:04.006 --> 00:12:05.096 A:middle
is used in Metal, if you're

00:12:05.096 --> 00:12:07.776 A:middle
familiar with the gather

00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:08.816 A:middle
operations in Metal.

00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:11.506 A:middle
So, again in that one

00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:12.686 A:middle
instruction we've done four

00:12:12.686 --> 00:12:13.966 A:middle
reads and we're going to repeat

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.356 A:middle
this process for the other

00:12:15.356 --> 00:12:16.056 A:middle
groups of four.

00:12:16.196 --> 00:12:17.946 A:middle
So, we're going to get group 2,

00:12:18.296 --> 00:12:20.006 A:middle
group 3, and group 4.

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:22.346 A:middle
Now that we've done all 16

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:23.626 A:middle
reads, we need to figure out

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.186 A:middle
what values go in what

00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:25.866 A:middle
locations.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:27.286 A:middle
So, the first thing we're going

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:29.626 A:middle
to do is get the appropriate

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:31.466 A:middle
channels of this 3 by 3 sub

00:12:31.466 --> 00:12:34.066 A:middle
group and average them together.

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:35.396 A:middle
And then we're going to store

00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:38.486 A:middle
those channels into the result 1

00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:38.886 A:middle
variable.

00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:40.486 A:middle
And we're going to repeat this

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:42.016 A:middle
process for the other four

00:12:42.016 --> 00:12:45.576 A:middle
result pixels that we want to

00:12:45.576 --> 00:12:46.106 A:middle
write -- R1, R2, R3, and R4.

00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:48.616 A:middle
And the last thing we're going

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:50.366 A:middle
to do is called "Destination

00:12:50.366 --> 00:12:52.956 A:middle
Write" to write the 4 pixels all

00:12:52.956 --> 00:12:53.806 A:middle
in one operation.

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:55.256 A:middle
So note, this is a little

00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:56.756 A:middle
different from a traditional CI

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.006 A:middle
kernel where you would've

00:12:58.006 --> 00:13:00.536 A:middle
returned a value from your
