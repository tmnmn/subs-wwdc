00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:01.076 A:middle
Python and Objective C and

00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:02.216 A:middle
[inaudible] in the context of

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:03.476 A:middle
Coco app development.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.266 A:middle
But since then it's been

00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:06.276 A:middle
extended to support most Apple

00:19:06.276 --> 00:19:07.426 A:middle
frameworks.

00:19:08.136 --> 00:19:11.426 A:middle
The calling syntax for PyObjC is

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:12.636 A:middle
very simple, you take your

00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:14.126 A:middle
existing Objective C code and

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:14.906 A:middle
you place columns with

00:19:14.906 --> 00:19:15.446 A:middle
underscore.

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:17.336 A:middle
There's a few more intricacies

00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:18.476 A:middle
and I encourage you to look at

00:19:18.476 --> 00:19:19.676 A:middle
the API if you'd like more

00:19:19.676 --> 00:19:20.206 A:middle
information.

00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:22.716 A:middle
But let's take our CIVector

00:19:22.716 --> 00:19:23.836 A:middle
class as an example here.

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:25.556 A:middle
So here we have some Objective C

00:19:25.556 --> 00:19:26.776 A:middle
code where we create an instance

00:19:26.776 --> 00:19:28.016 A:middle
of a CIVector by calling

00:19:28.016 --> 00:19:31.386 A:middle
CIVector, Vector with X, Y, Z,

00:19:31.386 --> 00:19:31.866 A:middle
W.

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:34.086 A:middle
Let's take a look a the PyObjC

00:19:34.086 --> 00:19:34.336 A:middle
code.

00:19:34.786 --> 00:19:35.436 A:middle
It's very similar.

00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:36.886 A:middle
We import the CIVector from the

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:39.376 A:middle
Quartz umbrella package and we

00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:40.506 A:middle
can call a vector with X, Y, Z,

00:19:40.506 --> 00:19:41.906 A:middle
W and the CIVector class

00:19:41.906 --> 00:19:42.246 A:middle
directly.

00:19:42.736 --> 00:19:45.396 A:middle
One thing you may note here is

00:19:45.396 --> 00:19:46.496 A:middle
that the code does not exactly

00:19:46.496 --> 00:19:47.276 A:middle
look Python-like.

00:19:48.106 --> 00:19:49.076 A:middle
And so, we're going to address

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:50.086 A:middle
that in just a few minutes.

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:55.076 A:middle
[inaudible] gram for

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:55.766 A:middle
PyCoreImage.

00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:57.446 A:middle
So the rendering back in is then

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:59.006 A:middle
using Core Image, and Core Image

00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:00.476 A:middle
is very close to the hardware,
