capture time; exist tags, as

00:23:01.416 --> 00:23:04.456 A:middle
well as embedded metadata such

00:23:04.456 --> 00:23:06.266 A:middle
as portrait map and portrait

00:23:06.266 --> 00:23:07.086 A:middle
depth information.

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.866 A:middle
Core Image handles color

00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:11.786 A:middle
management very well.

00:23:11.786 --> 00:23:13.086 A:middle
This is a difficult topic on its

00:23:13.086 --> 00:23:14.496 A:middle
own that a lot of frameworks

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:15.226 A:middle
don't handle.

00:23:16.376 --> 00:23:17.696 A:middle
Core Image supports many battery

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:20.536 A:middle
conditions, infinite images, and

00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:21.856 A:middle
has more than 200 built-in

00:23:21.856 --> 00:23:23.046 A:middle
filters that you can use, so you

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:24.066 A:middle
don't need to invent the wheel.

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:26.226 A:middle
All right, so I don't think I

00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:27.306 A:middle
need to convince you that that's

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:28.826 A:middle
a lot of information and if

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:30.246 A:middle
you're trying to use Core Image

00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:31.156 A:middle
in your prototype and your

00:23:31.156 --> 00:23:34.546 A:middle
workflow, the learning curve can

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:35.186 A:middle
be quite steep.

00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:36.796 A:middle
So what we did is we kept the

00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:38.486 A:middle
best of that list, made a few

00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:39.956 A:middle
simplifications, which,

00:23:39.956 --> 00:23:41.376 A:middle
remember, these simplifications

00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:42.636 A:middle
can all be overridden at one

00:23:42.636 --> 00:23:42.996 A:middle
time.

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:44.076 A:middle
And since we'll be giving you a

00:23:44.076 --> 00:23:45.536 A:middle
weighted code, you can actually

00:23:45.536 --> 00:23:46.846 A:middle
hardcode these changes in if

00:23:46.846 --> 00:23:48.356 A:middle
this was your prototyping stack.

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:50.726 A:middle
The first thing we did is that

00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:51.596 A:middle
we still have the

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:54.036 A:middle
high-performance feature of Core

00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:54.356 A:middle
Image.

00:23:54.356 --> 00:23:55.226 A:middle
We still render to a Metal

00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:55.736 A:middle
backend.

00:23:56.586 --> 00:23:57.566 A:middle
Most all formats are still

00:23:57.566 --> 00:23:59.566 A:middle
supported in and out and we can

00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:00.836 A:middle
still extract capture time of
