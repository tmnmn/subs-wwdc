00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:00.176 A:middle
an output, which has been run

00:40:00.176 --> 00:40:01.336 A:middle
through the underlying neural

00:40:01.336 --> 00:40:01.846 A:middle
network.

00:40:01.846 --> 00:40:02.916 A:middle
It's really that's simple;

00:40:02.916 --> 00:40:03.986 A:middle
extremely powerful.

00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:05.966 A:middle
Just to show you how simple the

00:40:05.966 --> 00:40:07.326 A:middle
code is, let's take a look at

00:40:07.326 --> 00:40:08.386 A:middle
Swift.

00:40:09.286 --> 00:40:10.076 A:middle
So, we have an input image on

00:40:10.076 --> 00:40:11.436 A:middle
the left-hand side, all we need

00:40:11.436 --> 00:40:12.676 A:middle
to do is call applying filter.

00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:14.556 A:middle
But as a new filter that we've

00:40:14.556 --> 00:40:15.676 A:middle
entered -- are introducing this

00:40:15.676 --> 00:40:16.846 A:middle
year and give your [inaudible]

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.346 A:middle
in the model.

00:40:18.566 --> 00:40:19.486 A:middle
It's really that simple.

00:40:19.566 --> 00:40:21.346 A:middle
And if you'd like to look at

00:40:21.346 --> 00:40:22.746 A:middle
other ways to leverage machine

00:40:22.746 --> 00:40:23.856 A:middle
learning in your image

00:40:23.856 --> 00:40:24.826 A:middle
processing applications, I

00:40:24.826 --> 00:40:26.776 A:middle
encourage you to look at the

00:40:26.776 --> 00:40:28.266 A:middle
other sessions on A Guide to

00:40:28.266 --> 00:40:29.916 A:middle
Turi Create as well as Vision

00:40:29.916 --> 00:40:30.556 A:middle
with CoreML.

00:40:33.106 --> 00:40:33.366 A:middle
All right.

00:40:33.366 --> 00:40:35.246 A:middle
On a related topic, one of the

00:40:35.246 --> 00:40:37.026 A:middle
common operations we carry in

00:40:37.026 --> 00:40:38.156 A:middle
our training datasets in machine

00:40:38.156 --> 00:40:39.946 A:middle
learning is data augmentation.

00:40:40.636 --> 00:40:43.126 A:middle
And data augmentation can

00:40:43.306 --> 00:40:43.976 A:middle
dramatically increase the

00:40:43.976 --> 00:40:45.776 A:middle
robustness of your neural

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:46.186 A:middle
networks.

00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:47.166 A:middle
In this particular case, let's

00:40:47.166 --> 00:40:49.026 A:middle
say we're doing object

00:40:49.026 --> 00:40:51.416 A:middle
classification and we're trying

00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:52.526 A:middle
to determine whether that image

00:40:52.526 --> 00:40:56.726 A:middle
is a bridge or has water in it.

00:40:57.006 --> 00:41:00.216 A:middle
So, augmentation is on your
