00:20:59.546 --> 00:21:00.696 A:middle
All right.

00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:02.116 A:middle
So, let's take an example how

00:21:02.116 --> 00:21:03.086 A:middle
you can apply a filter using

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:04.326 A:middle
PyCoreImage, and you'll see just

00:21:04.326 --> 00:21:05.376 A:middle
how simple and powerful the

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:06.196 A:middle
framework is.

00:21:06.526 --> 00:21:07.996 A:middle
So, the very first thing you

00:21:07.996 --> 00:21:09.466 A:middle
want to do is import your CIMG

00:21:09.466 --> 00:21:10.726 A:middle
class from your PyCoreImage

00:21:10.726 --> 00:21:13.086 A:middle
package, which we can then use

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:14.126 A:middle
to load the image from file.

00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:17.766 A:middle
Note that at this point we don't

00:21:17.766 --> 00:21:18.656 A:middle
have a pixel buffer.

00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:21.296 A:middle
Core Image creates recipes for

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:22.626 A:middle
images and in [inaudible] the

00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:24.836 A:middle
recipe is just giving

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:25.816 A:middle
instruction to load the image

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:26.276 A:middle
from file.

00:21:26.626 --> 00:21:28.546 A:middle
You can create a more

00:21:28.546 --> 00:21:30.166 A:middle
complicated graph by applying a

00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.686 A:middle
filter, by just calling the CI

00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:33.716 A:middle
filter name on it and passing

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:34.596 A:middle
the input primaries in this

00:21:34.596 --> 00:21:35.366 A:middle
case, a radius.

00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:36.726 A:middle
And we can that we are

00:21:36.726 --> 00:21:37.796 A:middle
assembling a more complicated

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:38.226 A:middle
graph.

00:21:38.226 --> 00:21:40.006 A:middle
And if we zoom on it, we can see

00:21:40.006 --> 00:21:41.276 A:middle
that we have out blur processor

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:41.996 A:middle
right at the middle.

00:21:43.146 --> 00:21:44.766 A:middle
If you want to get your pixel

00:21:44.766 --> 00:21:46.066 A:middle
buffer representation, what you

00:21:46.066 --> 00:21:47.956 A:middle
can do is call render on your

00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:48.866 A:middle
CIMG instance.

00:21:48.986 --> 00:21:50.896 A:middle
And what you get out is a proper

00:21:50.896 --> 00:21:52.000 A:middle
unit by buffer.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:57.206 A:middle
So, to make that possible, we

00:21:57.206 --> 00:21:57.876 A:middle
need to make a few

00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.666 A:middle
simplifications on how Core

00:21:59.666 --> 00:22:00.716 A:middle
Image is called or do a bit of
