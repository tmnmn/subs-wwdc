00:34:59.536 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
kernels inline and execute them

00:35:00.986 --> 00:35:02.476 A:middle
on the fly and modify them on

00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:02.836 A:middle
the fly.

00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:04.000 A:middle
So, let's take a look at that.

00:35:09.046 --> 00:35:09.216 A:middle
All right.

00:35:09.786 --> 00:35:11.406 A:middle
So, the first thing I want to

00:35:11.406 --> 00:35:12.736 A:middle
show is how to use color

00:35:12.736 --> 00:35:13.206 A:middle
kernels.

00:35:13.356 --> 00:35:14.956 A:middle
So, color kernels are kernels

00:35:14.956 --> 00:35:16.626 A:middle
that only take a pixel in and

00:35:16.626 --> 00:35:18.796 A:middle
spit a pixel out and don't make

00:35:18.796 --> 00:35:20.466 A:middle
any other samples around that

00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:20.856 A:middle
pixel.

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:22.866 A:middle
So, here's our input image and

00:35:22.866 --> 00:35:23.576 A:middle
here's our kernel.

00:35:23.826 --> 00:35:25.346 A:middle
So what we actually get in is a

00:35:25.346 --> 00:35:27.566 A:middle
color and we turn a color out.

00:35:27.716 --> 00:35:30.506 A:middle
So, let's take a look at this

00:35:30.506 --> 00:35:31.076 A:middle
effect here.

00:35:31.076 --> 00:35:32.566 A:middle
I'm going to be swapping my red

00:35:32.566 --> 00:35:34.246 A:middle
and blue channels with my blue

00:35:34.246 --> 00:35:35.356 A:middle
and red channels and we'll be

00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:36.006 A:middle
inverting them.

00:35:36.826 --> 00:35:38.226 A:middle
Not a terribly exciting effect,

00:35:38.226 --> 00:35:39.376 A:middle
but what I want to show you is

00:35:39.376 --> 00:35:41.476 A:middle
that I can do things like, start

00:35:42.676 --> 00:35:44.396 A:middle
typing away, and say, maybe I

00:35:44.396 --> 00:35:45.966 A:middle
want to scale my red channel by

00:35:45.966 --> 00:35:49.226 A:middle
my blue channel and I want to

00:35:49.226 --> 00:35:50.366 A:middle
just play with the amount of

00:35:50.366 --> 00:35:51.756 A:middle
scaling I'm playing here, so we

00:35:51.756 --> 00:35:54.716 A:middle
can go from .25 to pretty high

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:56.946 A:middle
values if we want to and

00:35:56.946 --> 00:35:57.916 A:middle
generate interesting effects

00:35:57.916 --> 00:35:58.116 A:middle
here.

00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:00.336 A:middle
It's extremely powerful, and
