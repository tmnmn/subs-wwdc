00:16:59.626 --> 00:17:00.866 A:middle
prototyping environment, a lot

00:17:00.866 --> 00:17:01.736 A:middle
of the memory management is

00:17:01.736 --> 00:17:02.586 A:middle
taken care of for you.

00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:04.266 A:middle
So, you don't often run into

00:17:04.266 --> 00:17:05.606 A:middle
issues of memory pressure and

00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:07.366 A:middle
memory consumption until it's

00:17:07.366 --> 00:17:09.626 A:middle
pretty late in the game.

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:11.886 A:middle
Another topic, of course, that's

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:15.016 A:middle
important to consider is

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:16.076 A:middle
performance.

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.886 A:middle
Oftentimes, the prototypes are

00:17:17.886 --> 00:17:19.796 A:middle
already using CPU code, and we

00:17:19.796 --> 00:17:21.455 A:middle
over - sometimes-- we often

00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:22.695 A:middle
over-estimate the amount of

00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:23.896 A:middle
performance we can get from

00:17:23.896 --> 00:17:25.536 A:middle
pointing our CP Code to GP Code,

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:26.306 A:middle
thinking that everything is

00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:27.106 A:middle
going to get real-time.

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.616 A:middle
So, what if we could catch these

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:33.106 A:middle
concerns way, way earlier on in

00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:34.146 A:middle
our prototyping and workflow?

00:17:35.116 --> 00:17:36.356 A:middle
Well, we believe we have a

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:37.086 A:middle
solution for you.

00:17:37.606 --> 00:17:39.476 A:middle
And it's called PyCoreImage.

00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:41.136 A:middle
Python bindings for Core Image.

00:17:42.386 --> 00:17:43.526 A:middle
So, this is combining the

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:45.636 A:middle
high-performance rendering of

00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:48.066 A:middle
Core Image with the flexibility

00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:49.136 A:middle
of the Python programming

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.256 A:middle
language together.

00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:52.366 A:middle
And by using Core Image, you

00:17:52.366 --> 00:17:54.066 A:middle
also inherit its support for

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:56.466 A:middle
both iOS and Mac OS along with

00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:58.106 A:middle
more than 200 built-in filters.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.626 A:middle
Let's take a look at what's
