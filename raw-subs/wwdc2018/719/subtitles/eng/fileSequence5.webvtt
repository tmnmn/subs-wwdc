00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:00.306 A:middle
runtime.

00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:03.776 A:middle
As before, you substantiate a

00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:06.326 A:middle
kernel based on this code by

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:08.136 A:middle
using the kernel with Metal

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:10.196 A:middle
function name and binary data.

00:05:11.526 --> 00:05:14.206 A:middle
The advantage here is that this

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.896 A:middle
data can be applied without

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:18.526 A:middle
paying the cost of an additional

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:18.946 A:middle
compile.

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:21.776 A:middle
The caveat, however, is it works

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:23.676 A:middle
on Metal backed CI context.

00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:25.606 A:middle
But it gives a big performance

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:27.606 A:middle
advantage.

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:29.976 A:middle
So, starting in this release

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:31.606 A:middle
we're going to be marking the CI

00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:33.296 A:middle
kernel language as deprecated,

00:05:33.786 --> 00:05:35.206 A:middle
because while we will continue

00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:37.486 A:middle
to support this language, we

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:39.106 A:middle
feel that the new way of writing

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.636 A:middle
Metal kernels offers a lot of

00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:41.606 A:middle
advantages to you, the

00:05:41.606 --> 00:05:42.096 A:middle
developer.

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.236 A:middle
For one thing, you get the

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:44.956 A:middle
performance advantage I outlined

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:46.496 A:middle
earlier, but it also gives you

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:48.606 A:middle
the advantage of getting build

00:05:48.606 --> 00:05:50.476 A:middle
time syntax coloring on your

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:52.726 A:middle
code and great debugging tools

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:54.596 A:middle
when you're working with your

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:56.946 A:middle
Metal source.

00:05:57.956 --> 00:05:58.916 A:middle
So, great.

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:03.246 A:middle
