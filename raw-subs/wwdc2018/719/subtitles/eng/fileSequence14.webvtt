00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:00.116 A:middle
Good afternoon everyone.

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:01.496 A:middle
It's great to be here.

00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:03.036 A:middle
My name is Emmanuel, I'm an

00:14:03.036 --> 00:14:04.116 A:middle
engineer on a Core Image team.

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:07.036 A:middle
So, during the next half of this

00:14:07.036 --> 00:14:08.766 A:middle
session, we'll shift our focus

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:10.206 A:middle
away from the Core Image Engine

00:14:10.356 --> 00:14:12.946 A:middle
and explore novel ways to

00:14:12.946 --> 00:14:14.066 A:middle
prototype using Core Image.

00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:17.266 A:middle
We'll also see how we can

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:18.206 A:middle
leverage Core Image in your

00:14:18.206 --> 00:14:19.286 A:middle
machine learning applications.

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:20.806 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:23.356 A:middle
Since I want to talk about

00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:24.966 A:middle
prototyping, let's take a look

00:14:25.076 --> 00:14:27.076 A:middle
at the lifecycle of an image

00:14:27.076 --> 00:14:27.816 A:middle
processing filter.

00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:33.136 A:middle
So, let's say that we are trying

00:14:33.136 --> 00:14:34.696 A:middle
to come up with a foreground to

00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:35.676 A:middle
background segmentation.

00:14:35.836 --> 00:14:38.506 A:middle
And here, what this means

00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:39.546 A:middle
precisely is that we'd like to

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.076 A:middle
get a mask which is 1.0 in the

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:43.076 A:middle
foreground; 0.0 in the

00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:44.596 A:middle
background and has continuous

00:14:44.596 --> 00:14:45.426 A:middle
values in between.

00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:48.256 A:middle
The difficulty in implementing

00:14:48.256 --> 00:14:49.986 A:middle
such a filter heavily depends on

00:14:49.986 --> 00:14:51.056 A:middle
the nature of data you have

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:51.576 A:middle
available.

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:54.466 A:middle
So, for example, if you have an

00:14:54.466 --> 00:14:56.006 A:middle
additional depth buffer,

00:14:56.406 --> 00:14:58.926 A:middle
alongside your RGB image, things

00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
can become easier.
