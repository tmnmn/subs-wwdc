00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.626 A:middle
Let's take a look at what's

00:18:00.626 --> 00:18:02.296 A:middle
under the hood of PyCoreImage.

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:05.906 A:middle
So, PyCoreImage is made of three

00:18:05.906 --> 00:18:06.656 A:middle
main pieces.

00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:09.366 A:middle
It uses Core Image for its

00:18:09.366 --> 00:18:10.086 A:middle
rendering back end.

00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:12.216 A:middle
It uses Python for the

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.806 A:middle
programming interface.

00:18:14.296 --> 00:18:16.796 A:middle
And it had -- it also has a thin

00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:19.106 A:middle
layer of an [inaudible] code to

00:18:19.106 --> 00:18:20.416 A:middle
allow interoperability with your

00:18:20.416 --> 00:18:21.356 A:middle
existing code bases.

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:24.526 A:middle
We believe PyCoreImage can now

00:18:24.526 --> 00:18:25.686 A:middle
allow you to reduce the friction

00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:27.466 A:middle
between your prototyping and

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:28.206 A:middle
product-ready code.

00:18:28.796 --> 00:18:30.126 A:middle
If you'd like to stay in a

00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:31.576 A:middle
Swift-centric environment, a lot

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:32.686 A:middle
of that can be done as well

00:18:32.686 --> 00:18:34.316 A:middle
using Swift playgrounds, and we

00:18:34.316 --> 00:18:35.066 A:middle
encourage you to look at a

00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:36.146 A:middle
session on creating your own

00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:38.936 A:middle
Swift playgrounds subscription.

00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:42.256 A:middle
All right.

00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:44.086 A:middle
Let's take a look at the main

00:18:44.086 --> 00:18:45.386 A:middle
components of PyCoreImage.

00:18:46.266 --> 00:18:48.276 A:middle
So, PyCoreImage leverages Python

00:18:48.276 --> 00:18:50.036 A:middle
bindings for objective C, PyObjC

00:18:50.036 --> 00:18:52.536 A:middle
and interestingly, we've been

00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:54.256 A:middle
shipping PyObjC since Mac OS

00:18:54.256 --> 00:18:55.156 A:middle
10.5 Leopard.

00:18:56.276 --> 00:18:58.096 A:middle
It was initially implemented as

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:59.316 A:middle
a bidirectional bridge between

00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:01.076 A:middle
Python and Objective C and
