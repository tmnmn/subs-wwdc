00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:00.956 A:middle
So, all of that is handled for

00:26:00.956 --> 00:26:02.226 A:middle
you under the hood.

00:26:02.956 --> 00:26:04.266 A:middle
Core Image also supports

00:26:04.366 --> 00:26:05.746 A:middle
residual images, such as

00:26:05.746 --> 00:26:08.006 A:middle
creating images from a color or

00:26:08.006 --> 00:26:08.856 A:middle
creating an image from a

00:26:08.856 --> 00:26:09.406 A:middle
generator.

00:26:11.156 --> 00:26:12.546 A:middle
Let's have a look at how to

00:26:12.546 --> 00:26:13.296 A:middle
apply filters now.

00:26:14.526 --> 00:26:16.126 A:middle
So, applying a filter has never

00:26:16.126 --> 00:26:16.476 A:middle
been easier.

00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:17.936 A:middle
You take a CIImage instance,

00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:19.676 A:middle
call the filter name directly on

00:26:19.676 --> 00:26:21.666 A:middle
it and pass the list of input

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:22.266 A:middle
primaries.

00:26:23.026 --> 00:26:24.476 A:middle
Every CIImage instance is

00:26:24.476 --> 00:26:26.496 A:middle
augmented with more than 200

00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:28.536 A:middle
lambda expressions, which

00:26:28.536 --> 00:26:30.516 A:middle
directly map to the Core Image

00:26:30.516 --> 00:26:30.996 A:middle
filters.

00:26:31.216 --> 00:26:33.406 A:middle
If you're in Swift, this is the

00:26:33.406 --> 00:26:34.726 A:middle
syntax you've seen before I'm

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.476 A:middle
sure, applying filter, passing

00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:38.106 A:middle
the filter name as well as the

00:26:38.106 --> 00:26:39.866 A:middle
list of input arguments as a

00:26:39.866 --> 00:26:41.536 A:middle
dictionary of key value pairs.

00:26:42.856 --> 00:26:45.376 A:middle
To apply kernels, you can go

00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:46.876 A:middle
applykernel in your CIMG

00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:48.966 A:middle
instance, passing of the source

00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:50.346 A:middle
string containing your kernel

00:26:50.346 --> 00:26:52.316 A:middle
code and the list of input

00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:53.976 A:middle
parameters to that kernel, and

00:26:53.976 --> 00:26:55.376 A:middle
we'll have a look at this in

00:26:55.376 --> 00:26:55.906 A:middle
just a second.

00:26:57.526 --> 00:26:58.806 A:middle
Then you just specify the extent

00:26:58.806 --> 00:26:59.456 A:middle
in which you're applying that

00:26:59.456 --> 00:27:00.746 A:middle
kernel, as well as a region of
