00:40:57.006 --> 00:41:00.216 A:middle
So, augmentation is on your

00:41:00.216 --> 00:41:01.846 A:middle
original trend dataset will

00:41:01.846 --> 00:41:03.066 A:middle
increase yet the number of

00:41:03.066 --> 00:41:04.206 A:middle
images you have in that dataset

00:41:04.206 --> 00:41:06.306 A:middle
without needing to gather new

00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:06.806 A:middle
images.

00:41:07.466 --> 00:41:08.286 A:middle
You essentially get them for

00:41:08.286 --> 00:41:08.586 A:middle
free.

00:41:09.046 --> 00:41:10.506 A:middle
So, there's many operations you

00:41:10.506 --> 00:41:11.176 A:middle
can carry.

00:41:11.446 --> 00:41:12.696 A:middle
One of them is just changing its

00:41:12.696 --> 00:41:13.116 A:middle
appearance.

00:41:13.116 --> 00:41:14.156 A:middle
For example, the tense, the

00:41:14.156 --> 00:41:15.626 A:middle
temperature and the white point

00:41:15.626 --> 00:41:16.156 A:middle
of your image.

00:41:17.236 --> 00:41:18.496 A:middle
Changing the spectral properties

00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:19.946 A:middle
of your image by adding noise.

00:41:21.466 --> 00:41:22.606 A:middle
Or changing the geometry of your

00:41:22.606 --> 00:41:23.806 A:middle
image by applying transforms.

00:41:25.026 --> 00:41:26.306 A:middle
Well, it turns out all of these

00:41:26.306 --> 00:41:27.636 A:middle
are trivial to achieve using

00:41:27.636 --> 00:41:28.146 A:middle
Core Image.

00:41:28.926 --> 00:41:29.786 A:middle
Let's take a look at a few

00:41:29.786 --> 00:41:31.476 A:middle
filters and how you can use them

00:41:31.666 --> 00:41:32.726 A:middle
for your data augmentation

00:41:32.726 --> 00:41:33.176 A:middle
purposes.

00:41:34.816 --> 00:41:35.716 A:middle
So, we have our input image on

00:41:35.716 --> 00:41:36.556 A:middle
the left-hand side here.

00:41:37.306 --> 00:41:38.606 A:middle
And we can change the

00:41:38.606 --> 00:41:40.016 A:middle
temperature and tint using CI

00:41:40.016 --> 00:41:40.716 A:middle
Temperature and Tint.

00:41:41.806 --> 00:41:43.096 A:middle
We can adjust the brightness,

00:41:43.186 --> 00:41:44.846 A:middle
contrast, as well as saturation

00:41:44.846 --> 00:41:47.296 A:middle
in your images using CI color

00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:47.906 A:middle
controls.

00:41:49.066 --> 00:41:50.126 A:middle
Change the frequency spectrum of

00:41:50.126 --> 00:41:51.896 A:middle
your image using CI dither as

00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:53.006 A:middle
well as CI GaussianBlur.

00:41:53.566 --> 00:41:56.066 A:middle
And change the geometry of your

00:41:56.066 --> 00:41:57.736 A:middle
image using affine transforms.

00:41:58.586 --> 00:42:00.386 A:middle
Let's take a look at all of this
