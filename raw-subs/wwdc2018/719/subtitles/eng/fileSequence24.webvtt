00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:00.836 A:middle
still extract capture time of

00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:02.456 A:middle
the data as well as portrait

00:24:02.456 --> 00:24:04.756 A:middle
depth and matte information.

00:24:05.656 --> 00:24:06.536 A:middle
Last but not least, you have

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:08.086 A:middle
more than 200 built-in filters

00:24:08.086 --> 00:24:08.776 A:middle
that you can use.

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:11.306 A:middle
The first change we made is that

00:24:11.306 --> 00:24:12.826 A:middle
by default, all your renders

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:14.676 A:middle
will be done using full 32-bit

00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:14.986 A:middle
float.

00:24:16.676 --> 00:24:18.506 A:middle
Second change, everything will

00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:20.266 A:middle
be done using SRGB color spaces.

00:24:21.516 --> 00:24:22.956 A:middle
Third, all the boundary

00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:24.196 A:middle
conditions will be handled with

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.166 A:middle
clamped and cropping.

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:26.426 A:middle
What that means is, if you're

00:24:26.426 --> 00:24:27.866 A:middle
applying convolution or

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:29.796 A:middle
creation, for example, your

00:24:29.796 --> 00:24:30.916 A:middle
image will be repeated

00:24:30.916 --> 00:24:31.616 A:middle
infinitely.

00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:33.926 A:middle
A filter will be applied, and

00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:34.716 A:middle
the resulting image will be

00:24:34.716 --> 00:24:36.296 A:middle
cropped back to your input size.

00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:38.236 A:middle
This is a setting that can also

00:24:38.236 --> 00:24:40.526 A:middle
be overridden at one time.

00:24:41.616 --> 00:24:44.146 A:middle
Finally, infinite images become

00:24:44.146 --> 00:24:45.826 A:middle
finite so that we can get their

00:24:45.956 --> 00:24:48.596 A:middle
pixel buffer representation, and

00:24:49.546 --> 00:24:52.326 A:middle
that's what really PyCoreImage

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:52.976 A:middle
is under the hood.

00:24:53.466 --> 00:24:57.086 A:middle
So, before looking at a great

00:24:57.086 --> 00:24:59.076 A:middle
demo of all of this in practice,

00:24:59.076 --> 00:24:59.986 A:middle
I just want to go through

00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:01.926 A:middle
quickly a cheat sheet for
