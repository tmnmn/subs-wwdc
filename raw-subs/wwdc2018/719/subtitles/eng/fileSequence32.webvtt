00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:01.596 A:middle
around and go from NumPy to Core

00:32:01.656 --> 00:32:01.886 A:middle
Image.

00:32:02.506 --> 00:32:04.596 A:middle
To do this, let's start with a

00:32:04.596 --> 00:32:05.576 A:middle
NumPy array-- that's

00:32:05.576 --> 00:32:06.146 A:middle
non-trivial.

00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:08.066 A:middle
In this case, a random -- a

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:10.046 A:middle
random buffer where 75% of the

00:32:10.046 --> 00:32:11.346 A:middle
values have been [inaudible] to

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:11.746 A:middle
black.

00:32:12.926 --> 00:32:15.396 A:middle
First thing I do here is wrap my

00:32:15.396 --> 00:32:16.646 A:middle
NumPy array into my CIMG

00:32:16.646 --> 00:32:18.566 A:middle
constructor, and we can see that

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:19.946 A:middle
we have again, our CIMG class

00:32:19.946 --> 00:32:21.656 A:middle
instance and the backing

00:32:21.726 --> 00:32:22.336 A:middle
CIImage.

00:32:23.576 --> 00:32:26.376 A:middle
Now that I have my CIImage, I

00:32:26.376 --> 00:32:27.606 A:middle
can apply a variety of filters

00:32:27.606 --> 00:32:27.866 A:middle
on it.

00:32:28.296 --> 00:32:29.936 A:middle
So, the first thing I do is I'll

00:32:29.936 --> 00:32:30.756 A:middle
apply this blur.

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:33.036 A:middle
I'll use a wire filter; a light

00:32:33.036 --> 00:32:33.396 A:middle
tunnel.

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:35.576 A:middle
Change of contrast in my image.

00:32:36.036 --> 00:32:38.006 A:middle
The exposure adjustment as well

00:32:38.006 --> 00:32:38.866 A:middle
as the gamma value.

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:40.706 A:middle
Let's take a look at these

00:32:40.706 --> 00:32:41.916 A:middle
filters side-by-side.

00:32:42.556 --> 00:32:44.346 A:middle
So at this blur, light tunnel,

00:32:44.346 --> 00:32:45.966 A:middle
exposure adjust; gamma adjust,

00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:47.506 A:middle
here's our final effect.

00:32:48.396 --> 00:32:49.576 A:middle
Pretty fun and really easy to

00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:49.986 A:middle
work with.

00:32:52.586 --> 00:32:53.336 A:middle
So we -- let's put it all

00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:53.746 A:middle
together.

00:32:53.746 --> 00:32:54.916 A:middle
So, I'm going to start with a

00:32:54.916 --> 00:32:57.316 A:middle
new image here, and what I'll be

00:32:57.316 --> 00:32:59.246 A:middle
showing you in this demo is, how

00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:00.536 A:middle
we can do bend processing.
