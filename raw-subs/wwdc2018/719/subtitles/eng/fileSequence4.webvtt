00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:02.476 A:middle
The traditional way is to use

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.646 A:middle
the CI kernel language.

00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:05.396 A:middle
And in this case, you have a

00:04:05.396 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
string inside your source file;

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.356 A:middle
either your Swift code or your

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:09.256 A:middle
objective C code.

00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:11.726 A:middle
And at run time you make a call,

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:13.686 A:middle
to say, kernel with source.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.016 A:middle
And later on, when you create an

00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:18.706 A:middle
image based on that kernel, you

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:20.446 A:middle
can then render that to any type

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:21.565 A:middle
of Core Image context, whether

00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:24.156 A:middle
that context is backed by Metal

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.476 A:middle
or open GL.

00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:28.066 A:middle
When it comes time to render,

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:29.736 A:middle
however, that source needs to be

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:30.346 A:middle
translated.

00:04:30.346 --> 00:04:31.556 A:middle
It needs to be translated either

00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:34.856 A:middle
to Metal or GLSL, and that step

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:35.666 A:middle
has a cost.

00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:38.006 A:middle
Eventually then, that code is

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:40.056 A:middle
compiled to the GPU instruction

00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:41.426 A:middle
set and then executed.

00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:45.046 A:middle
Starting last year in iOS 11, we

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:46.586 A:middle
added a new way of writing CI

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:47.616 A:middle
kernels, which has some

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:48.926 A:middle
significant advantages.

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.896 A:middle
And that's CI kernels based on

00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:51.986 A:middle
the Metal shading language.

00:04:52.686 --> 00:04:54.556 A:middle
In this case, you have your

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:56.056 A:middle
source in your project and this

00:04:56.056 --> 00:04:57.826 A:middle
is -- this source is complied at

00:04:57.826 --> 00:04:59.836 A:middle
build time rather than at

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:00.306 A:middle
runtime.
