00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:01.126 A:middle
so that the assumption is that a

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.906 A:middle
subsequent render can be made as

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:03.776 A:middle
fast as possible.

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:05.946 A:middle
There are, sometimes, however,

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.546 A:middle
when you might want to turn off

00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:08.886 A:middle
caching of intermediates.

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:10.756 A:middle
So, for example, if you

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.106 A:middle
application is going to be doing

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:14.436 A:middle
a batch export of 100 images,

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.306 A:middle
there is little benefit of

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:17.656 A:middle
caching the first one, because

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:18.776 A:middle
you'll be rendering a completely

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:20.026 A:middle
different image afterwards.

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:21.956 A:middle
So, you can do that today in

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:23.336 A:middle
your application by using the

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.936 A:middle
context option cache

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:26.046 A:middle
intermediates and setting that

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:26.976 A:middle
value to false.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.176 A:middle
However, if you are also using

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.966 A:middle
this new API that we spoke

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.466 A:middle
about, you can still turn on

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:35.836 A:middle
caching of intermediates, even

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.676 A:middle
if this context option is turned

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:38.436 A:middle
off.

00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:39.686 A:middle
So, this allows you to really

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:40.806 A:middle
make sure that we cache

00:03:40.806 --> 00:03:41.956 A:middle
something and don't cache

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:42.686 A:middle
anything else.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.846 A:middle
The next subject I'd like to

00:03:46.846 --> 00:03:48.606 A:middle
talk about is some new features

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:50.446 A:middle
we've added to the kernel

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.876 A:middle
language that allows us to apply

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:53.656 A:middle
image processing.

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:56.596 A:middle
So, one thing to keep in mind is

00:03:56.596 --> 00:03:58.216 A:middle
that we have two different ways

00:03:58.216 --> 00:03:59.386 A:middle
of writing kernels in Core

00:03:59.386 --> 00:03:59.696 A:middle
Image.
