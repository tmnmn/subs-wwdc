00:37:59.336 --> 00:38:01.086 A:middle
changes there in real time.

00:38:02.426 --> 00:38:04.116 A:middle
The other thing I wanted to show

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:06.546 A:middle
you is how to load metadata from

00:38:06.546 --> 00:38:07.126 A:middle
your images.

00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:09.696 A:middle
So, here I have an image that

00:38:09.696 --> 00:38:11.116 A:middle
has portrait effect matte loaded

00:38:11.116 --> 00:38:12.616 A:middle
in, as well as portrait depth

00:38:12.616 --> 00:38:12.806 A:middle
data.

00:38:14.216 --> 00:38:15.106 A:middle
Here are the images

00:38:15.106 --> 00:38:15.726 A:middle
side-by-side.

00:38:16.416 --> 00:38:18.206 A:middle
The image on the left is the RGB

00:38:18.206 --> 00:38:18.646 A:middle
image.

00:38:18.646 --> 00:38:20.296 A:middle
In the center is the depth data.

00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:21.066 A:middle
On the right-hand side is a

00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:22.326 A:middle
high-quality portrait effects

00:38:22.326 --> 00:38:23.786 A:middle
map, which we introduced in

00:38:23.786 --> 00:38:24.686 A:middle
another session today.

00:38:25.566 --> 00:38:27.256 A:middle
We can also look at the exist

00:38:27.256 --> 00:38:29.086 A:middle
tags directly by looking at the

00:38:29.086 --> 00:38:31.906 A:middle
underlying CIImage from CIMG

00:38:31.966 --> 00:38:33.486 A:middle
instances and calling

00:38:33.486 --> 00:38:33.996 A:middle
properties.

00:38:35.006 --> 00:38:36.166 A:middle
Here, we get information

00:38:36.526 --> 00:38:37.656 A:middle
pertaining to the actual capture

00:38:37.656 --> 00:38:38.056 A:middle
itself.

00:38:40.056 --> 00:38:41.206 A:middle
Like I said, we introduce the

00:38:41.206 --> 00:38:42.776 A:middle
portrait effects matte at

00:38:42.776 --> 00:38:44.466 A:middle
another session, Session 503, so

00:38:44.466 --> 00:38:45.666 A:middle
I highly encourage you to look

00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:45.916 A:middle
at it.

00:38:45.916 --> 00:38:47.166 A:middle
So without going into the

00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:49.436 A:middle
details here, I'm going to be

00:38:49.436 --> 00:38:50.206 A:middle
choosing this filter.

00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:51.676 A:middle
If you are interested to know

00:38:51.676 --> 00:38:53.896 A:middle
how we did this, I highly

00:38:53.896 --> 00:38:55.376 A:middle
encourage you to take a look at

00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:55.796 A:middle
this session.

00:38:57.226 --> 00:38:58.626 A:middle
Pretty fun stuff [applause].

00:38:59.696 --> 00:39:01.106 A:middle
Thank you.
