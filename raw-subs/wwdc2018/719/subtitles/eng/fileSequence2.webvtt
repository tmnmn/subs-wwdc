00:01:58.796 --> 00:02:00.776 A:middle
scenarios where you don't want

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:02.766 A:middle
to concatenate as much as

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:03.226 A:middle
possible.

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:05.216 A:middle
For example, your application

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.886 A:middle
might have an expensive filter

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:08.476 A:middle
early on in the filter chain.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.876 A:middle
And the user of your application

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:12.376 A:middle
at a given moment in time might

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:13.486 A:middle
be adjusting a filter that

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:15.146 A:middle
follows it in the graph.

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:16.786 A:middle
And this is a classic situation

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.076 A:middle
where it's a good idea to have

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.216 A:middle
an intermediate buffer at a

00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:22.116 A:middle
location like this in between.

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:24.546 A:middle
The idea is that by having an

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:26.346 A:middle
intermediate buffer here, the

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.186 A:middle
cost of the expensive filter

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.126 A:middle
does not have to be paid for

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:32.726 A:middle
again when you adjust a

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:33.566 A:middle
secondary filter.

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.426 A:middle
So, how do you do this in your

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:36.036 A:middle
application?

00:02:36.036 --> 00:02:38.006 A:middle
We have a new API, very aptly

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:39.846 A:middle
named, inserting intermediate.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.486 A:middle
So, let's talk about how this

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:43.756 A:middle
affects our results.

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:44.736 A:middle
What we do is instead of

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:45.896 A:middle
concatenating as much as

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:47.616 A:middle
possible, we will respect that

00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:49.516 A:middle
location of the intermediate and

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
concatenate as much as possible

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:51.746 A:middle
around it.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.246 A:middle
Some notes on this.

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:55.966 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind, is

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.846 A:middle
that by default, Core Image

00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:59.496 A:middle
cashes all intermediate buffers

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:01.126 A:middle
so that the assumption is that a
