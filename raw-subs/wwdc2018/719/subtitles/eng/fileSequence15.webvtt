00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
can become easier.

00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:01.456 A:middle
And if you're interested to

00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:03.736 A:middle
combine RGB images with depth

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.576 A:middle
information, I highly encourage

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:07.466 A:middle
you to look at the session on

00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:08.676 A:middle
creating photo and video effects

00:15:08.676 --> 00:15:09.116 A:middle
using that.

00:15:10.506 --> 00:15:12.736 A:middle
Today, I don't want to focus on

00:15:12.736 --> 00:15:13.706 A:middle
these other sources of

00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:15.016 A:middle
information, but I want to focus

00:15:15.016 --> 00:15:16.296 A:middle
on prototyping in general, so --

00:15:16.956 --> 00:15:20.726 A:middle
so let's say that -- so, we have

00:15:20.726 --> 00:15:23.766 A:middle
this filter well-drafted, and we

00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:24.946 A:middle
know the effect we're trying to

00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:25.906 A:middle
come up with, so in this

00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:26.926 A:middle
particular case, a foreground

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:27.716 A:middle
and background mask.

00:15:28.526 --> 00:15:30.246 A:middle
The very next natural step is to

00:15:30.246 --> 00:15:32.286 A:middle
try implementing it, and you

00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:33.256 A:middle
pick your favorite prototype in

00:15:33.256 --> 00:15:34.826 A:middle
the stack and you start hacking

00:15:34.826 --> 00:15:36.806 A:middle
away and combining different

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:37.986 A:middle
filters together and showing

00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:39.506 A:middle
them in such a way that you

00:15:39.886 --> 00:15:41.446 A:middle
achieve the filter effect that

00:15:41.446 --> 00:15:42.436 A:middle
you're looking after.

00:15:44.006 --> 00:15:45.446 A:middle
So, let's say you did just that,

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:46.796 A:middle
and here we have an example of

00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:49.826 A:middle
such a foreground to background

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:50.476 A:middle
mask.

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:52.906 A:middle
Now, if you're in an iOS or Mac

00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:54.576 A:middle
OS environment, the very next

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.086 A:middle
natural step is to deploy that

00:15:57.086 --> 00:15:57.686 A:middle
algorithm.

00:15:57.686 --> 00:16:00.226 A:middle
So, you have a variety of
