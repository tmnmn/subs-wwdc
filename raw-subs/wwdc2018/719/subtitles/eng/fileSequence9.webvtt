00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:01.236 A:middle
9 samples from the input image

00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:02.556 A:middle
and we're only using the red

00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:03.106 A:middle
channel of it.

00:09:03.756 --> 00:09:05.486 A:middle
And then once we have those 9

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:06.596 A:middle
values, we're going to average

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:08.146 A:middle
those 9 values and write them

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:09.516 A:middle
out in the traditional way by

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:11.146 A:middle
returning a single vec4 pixel

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:11.996 A:middle
value.

00:09:12.606 --> 00:09:15.586 A:middle
Now, first step to make this

00:09:15.586 --> 00:09:16.776 A:middle
faster is to convert this to

00:09:16.776 --> 00:09:16.976 A:middle
Metal.

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:18.366 A:middle
This is actually quite simple.

00:09:18.366 --> 00:09:19.576 A:middle
So, we start with code that

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:20.876 A:middle
looks like this, which is our

00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:22.196 A:middle
traditional CI kernel language.

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:23.646 A:middle
And with effectively, some

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.796 A:middle
searching and replacing in your

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:26.646 A:middle
code, you could update this to

00:09:26.646 --> 00:09:28.686 A:middle
the new Metal-based CI kernel

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:29.136 A:middle
language.

00:09:29.346 --> 00:09:30.186 A:middle
There's a couple things that are

00:09:30.186 --> 00:09:31.086 A:middle
important to notice here.

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:33.806 A:middle
We have added a destination

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.096 A:middle
parameter to the kernel, and

00:09:35.096 --> 00:09:36.606 A:middle
this is important if you're

00:09:37.106 --> 00:09:38.236 A:middle
checking for the destination

00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:39.756 A:middle
coordinate inside your shader,

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:41.436 A:middle
which a convolution-like kernel

00:09:41.436 --> 00:09:42.156 A:middle
like this does.

00:09:42.686 --> 00:09:44.056 A:middle
And then we're using the new,

00:09:44.056 --> 00:09:45.686 A:middle
more modern syntax to sample

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.146 A:middle
from the input by just saying

00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:49.056 A:middle
sample -- s.sample and

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:49.986 A:middle
s.transform.

00:09:50.806 --> 00:09:52.246 A:middle
And the last thing we've done

00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:53.416 A:middle
when we've updated this code is

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:55.666 A:middle
to change the traditional vec4

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.266 A:middle
and vec2 parameter types to

00:09:57.706 --> 00:09:59.756 A:middle
float 4 and float 2.
