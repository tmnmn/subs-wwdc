00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:04.226 A:middle
This is our input image, and now

00:30:04.226 --> 00:30:05.386 A:middle
I want to apply a filter on it,

00:30:05.546 --> 00:30:07.136 A:middle
so let's take a look at the 200

00:30:07.136 --> 00:30:08.306 A:middle
plus filters that are supported

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.000 A:middle
in Core Image.

00:30:13.116 --> 00:30:14.456 A:middle
Let's say that I'm interested in

00:30:14.456 --> 00:30:16.176 A:middle
applying GaussianBlur here, and

00:30:16.176 --> 00:30:16.946 A:middle
I'd like to know which

00:30:16.946 --> 00:30:18.306 A:middle
parameters are supported by that

00:30:18.306 --> 00:30:19.386 A:middle
filter, so I'm going to call

00:30:19.386 --> 00:30:21.856 A:middle
inputs on my CIMG class, and I

00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:23.926 A:middle
see that it supports input image

00:30:24.206 --> 00:30:25.356 A:middle
-- I shouldn't be surprised --

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:26.566 A:middle
as well as an input radius.

00:30:26.986 --> 00:30:28.356 A:middle
So, I'm going to do just that

00:30:28.356 --> 00:30:28.666 A:middle
here.

00:30:29.886 --> 00:30:30.696 A:middle
Take my input image.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:32.786 A:middle
Apply GaussianBlur filter on it

00:30:32.946 --> 00:30:34.726 A:middle
with a radius of 100 pixels, and

00:30:35.236 --> 00:30:36.176 A:middle
then show the two images

00:30:36.176 --> 00:30:36.786 A:middle
side-by-side.

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:41.596 A:middle
So, pretty easy, right?

00:30:42.176 --> 00:30:42.526 A:middle
Okay.

00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:45.116 A:middle
Let's keep going.

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:46.026 A:middle
Like I mentioned earlier, you

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:47.326 A:middle
can generate procedural images

00:30:47.326 --> 00:30:48.076 A:middle
using Core Image.

00:30:48.266 --> 00:30:49.506 A:middle
So, we'll take a look at Core

00:30:49.506 --> 00:30:50.636 A:middle
Image generators.

00:30:51.626 --> 00:30:52.956 A:middle
And the first thing we do here

00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:54.536 A:middle
is we call from generator --

00:30:54.536 --> 00:30:55.736 A:middle
specify the name of our

00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:56.186 A:middle
generator.

00:30:56.286 --> 00:30:58.756 A:middle
In this case, CIQR code and pass

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.916 A:middle
them in the message that we're
