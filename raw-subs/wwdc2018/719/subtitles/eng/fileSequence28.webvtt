00:27:59.776 --> 00:28:00.916 A:middle
on the filter itself, but how to

00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:01.436 A:middle
call it.

00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:04.556 A:middle
So, we call it black kernel on

00:28:04.556 --> 00:28:05.696 A:middle
our CIMG instance.

00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:08.576 A:middle
Bass source code, that's just

00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:10.306 A:middle
sitting above using a triple

00:28:10.306 --> 00:28:11.026 A:middle
[inaudible] python string.

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:13.486 A:middle
[Inaudible] the extent in which

00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:14.806 A:middle
we're going to be applying the

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:15.206 A:middle
kernel.

00:28:15.816 --> 00:28:18.226 A:middle
And define the region of

00:28:18.226 --> 00:28:19.656 A:middle
interest is along the expression

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:20.646 A:middle
that we're going to be sampling

00:28:20.646 --> 00:28:20.996 A:middle
from.

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.126 A:middle
If you're not familiar with the

00:28:23.126 --> 00:28:24.396 A:middle
concepts of domain of

00:28:24.396 --> 00:28:25.876 A:middle
destination as well as regions

00:28:25.876 --> 00:28:27.656 A:middle
of interest, I encourage you to

00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:29.086 A:middle
look at online documentation for

00:28:29.086 --> 00:28:30.706 A:middle
Core Image as well as previous

00:28:30.706 --> 00:28:31.566 A:middle
WWDC sessions.

00:28:32.216 --> 00:28:33.716 A:middle
But here is the convolutional

00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:35.426 A:middle
kernel, we are reading one pixel

00:28:35.426 --> 00:28:36.506 A:middle
away from the boundary, so we

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.216 A:middle
need to instruct Core Image if

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.436 A:middle
we're going to be doing so, so

00:28:39.436 --> 00:28:40.586 A:middle
that it can handle boundary

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:41.526 A:middle
conditions properly.

00:28:43.016 --> 00:28:43.606 A:middle
All right.

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:44.516 A:middle
So, that was a lot of

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:47.016 A:middle
information and looking at APIs

00:28:47.016 --> 00:28:48.766 A:middle
is going to always be dry, so

00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:49.626 A:middle
let's take a look at a demo and

00:28:49.626 --> 00:28:50.526 A:middle
let's put all of this into

00:28:50.526 --> 00:28:51.000 A:middle
practice.

00:28:55.508 --> 00:28:57.508 A:middle
