00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.506 A:middle
we'll take a look at here -- how

00:43:00.506 --> 00:43:01.936 A:middle
they are being -- actually saved

00:43:01.936 --> 00:43:03.126 A:middle
to disc in real time.

00:43:03.306 --> 00:43:04.826 A:middle
So let's just do that, just to

00:43:04.826 --> 00:43:05.856 A:middle
give you a sense of how fast

00:43:05.856 --> 00:43:06.000 A:middle
that is.

00:43:10.156 --> 00:43:11.000 A:middle
That's really powerful.

00:43:15.236 --> 00:43:15.686 A:middle
All right.

00:43:16.886 --> 00:43:17.806 A:middle
This next thing I want to show

00:43:17.806 --> 00:43:20.346 A:middle
you is how to use CoreML using

00:43:20.346 --> 00:43:20.836 A:middle
Core Image.

00:43:22.026 --> 00:43:23.776 A:middle
And first thing you do is to

00:43:23.776 --> 00:43:25.096 A:middle
load your Core ML model in,

00:43:25.246 --> 00:43:26.066 A:middle
which we did here.

00:43:26.066 --> 00:43:28.606 A:middle
We have a glass model, which

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:30.736 A:middle
we're going to be using to

00:43:30.866 --> 00:43:32.046 A:middle
generate interesting effect.

00:43:32.146 --> 00:43:32.806 A:middle
So, let's start with the

00:43:32.806 --> 00:43:33.696 A:middle
procedural image.

00:43:34.376 --> 00:43:35.316 A:middle
We've seen this one before.

00:43:35.876 --> 00:43:37.866 A:middle
And then to make it a bit more

00:43:37.866 --> 00:43:38.756 A:middle
interesting, we'll add some

00:43:38.756 --> 00:43:39.416 A:middle
texture to it.

00:43:40.196 --> 00:43:42.336 A:middle
So, we'll be adding multi-band

00:43:42.336 --> 00:43:46.096 A:middle
noise on it as well as some

00:43:46.096 --> 00:43:47.956 A:middle
feathering and some [inaudible].

00:43:47.956 --> 00:43:51.146 A:middle
All right, so this is the input

00:43:51.146 --> 00:43:52.526 A:middle
image we're going to be feeding

00:43:52.526 --> 00:43:54.126 A:middle
to our neural network alongside

00:43:54.126 --> 00:43:55.796 A:middle
the other -- the CoreML model

00:43:55.796 --> 00:43:57.716 A:middle
that we have pre-trained.

00:43:58.026 --> 00:43:58.326 A:middle
All right?

00:43:58.916 --> 00:44:01.500 A:middle
So, let's run this.
