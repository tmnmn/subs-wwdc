00:39:00.536 --> 00:39:01.146 A:middle
Here goes nothing.

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:02.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:39:02.826 --> 00:39:02.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great!

00:39:03.516 --> 00:39:07.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:08.216 --> 00:39:09.296 A:middle
I'm going to reload and take a

00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:11.126 A:middle
slow-mo victory lap just to--

00:39:11.126 --> 00:39:13.696 A:middle
there we go.

00:39:13.946 --> 00:39:15.446 A:middle
That looks exactly like our

00:39:15.446 --> 00:39:16.356 A:middle
spec, doesn't it.

00:39:16.356 --> 00:39:17.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's great, awesome.

00:39:17.986 --> 00:39:18.206 A:middle
All right.

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:19.766 A:middle
Well let's wrap it up.

00:39:19.766 --> 00:39:21.496 A:middle
We covered a ton of content.

00:39:21.496 --> 00:39:22.236 A:middle
Can you switch it back to

00:39:22.236 --> 00:39:22.796 A:middle
slides?

00:39:23.906 --> 00:39:24.986 A:middle
And I'd like to issue a bit of a

00:39:24.986 --> 00:39:25.716 A:middle
call to action.

00:39:25.716 --> 00:39:28.576 A:middle
So if you've been nervous or

00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:30.636 A:middle
anxiety building that custom

00:39:30.636 --> 00:39:32.106 A:middle
layout, take the stuff we just

00:39:32.106 --> 00:39:33.586 A:middle
applied today and go back and

00:39:33.906 --> 00:39:35.196 A:middle
dive in and create those custom

00:39:35.196 --> 00:39:36.376 A:middle
layouts and build really great

00:39:36.806 --> 00:39:38.016 A:middle
CollectionView solutions.

00:39:38.016 --> 00:39:39.806 A:middle
And if you got a lot of reload

00:39:39.806 --> 00:39:41.016 A:middle
data sprinkled all throughout

00:39:41.016 --> 00:39:42.396 A:middle
your apps and you're losing out

00:39:42.396 --> 00:39:43.596 A:middle
on these gray animations.

00:39:44.016 --> 00:39:45.046 A:middle
They'll inspect those things and

00:39:45.046 --> 00:39:46.376 A:middle
see maybe why you didn't

00:39:46.376 --> 00:39:47.596 A:middle
understand or something wasn't

00:39:47.686 --> 00:39:48.966 A:middle
quite jived about why it was

00:39:48.966 --> 00:39:52.376 A:middle
happening and fix those spots.

00:39:52.546 --> 00:39:54.056 A:middle
Okay, so more information, you

00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:55.286 A:middle
can see the link on the slide

00:39:55.286 --> 00:39:55.536 A:middle
here.

00:39:56.266 --> 00:39:57.236 A:middle
And we also have a

00:39:57.236 --> 00:39:58.156 A:middle
CollectionView lab tomorrow

00:39:58.156 --> 00:39:59.346 A:middle
morning at 9.

00:39:59.346 --> 00:40:00.746 A:middle
