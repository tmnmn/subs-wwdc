00:12:00.046 --> 00:12:01.936 A:middle
class that we've put together,

00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:06.536 A:middle
and let's take a look at what we

00:12:06.536 --> 00:12:07.176 A:middle
need to do here.

00:12:07.176 --> 00:12:10.236 A:middle
So I already have a stub

00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:12.376 A:middle
override of the layouts prepare

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:12.916 A:middle
method.

00:12:13.506 --> 00:12:13.686 A:middle
Now,

00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:15.756 A:middle
UICollectionViewLayoutsPrepare

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:17.266 A:middle
method is called whenever the

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:19.406 A:middle
layout is invalidated, and in

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:19.906 A:middle
the case of

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.476 A:middle
UICollectionFlowLayout, our

00:12:22.636 --> 00:12:24.646 A:middle
layout is invalidated whenever

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:26.416 A:middle
the CollectionView's bounds of

00:12:26.416 --> 00:12:27.336 A:middle
size changes.

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:29.626 A:middle
So if our app rotates on a phone

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:31.956 A:middle
or if our app is resized on an

00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:32.446 A:middle
iPad.

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.976 A:middle
So this is a great place to do

00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:39.366 A:middle
any customization that takes the

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:41.026 A:middle
size of the CollectionView into

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:41.506 A:middle
account.

00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:42.986 A:middle
In our case, we want our cells

00:12:42.986 --> 00:12:45.456 A:middle
to be some function of the

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:46.756 A:middle
CollectionView's width.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.886 A:middle
And we can let the

00:12:48.886 --> 00:12:51.236 A:middle
CollectionView know how big we

00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:53.146 A:middle
want our items to be by saying

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:54.436 A:middle
it's item sized properties.

00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:55.876 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and do

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:56.296 A:middle
that here.

00:12:57.426 --> 00:12:58.586 A:middle
So I'm just going to set my

00:12:58.586 --> 00:13:01.086 A:middle
CollectionView's item size to a
