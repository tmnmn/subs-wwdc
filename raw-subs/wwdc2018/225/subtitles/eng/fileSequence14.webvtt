00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.176 A:middle
Now while this is okay, you

00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:03.106 A:middle
might be thinking, it's not the

00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:04.316 A:middle
best that we can do here.

00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:06.886 A:middle
It doesn't look as great as it

00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:07.976 A:middle
can.

00:14:08.486 --> 00:14:09.736 A:middle
We might want to do something

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:10.696 A:middle
more interesting here like

00:14:10.696 --> 00:14:12.216 A:middle
display multiple columns since

00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:14.546 A:middle
we have the space available to

00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:14.806 A:middle
us.

00:14:15.336 --> 00:14:16.936 A:middle
Now flow layout makes it really

00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:17.876 A:middle
easy to do this.

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:19.926 A:middle
If you remember during Steve's

00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:21.366 A:middle
explanation of how flow layout

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:22.666 A:middle
performs it's layout earlier,

00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:24.536 A:middle
flow layout will automatically

00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:26.656 A:middle
try to fit in as many items as

00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.876 A:middle
it can within a line before it

00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:29.946 A:middle
wraps to the next one.

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:33.396 A:middle
So using that, we can kind of

00:14:33.876 --> 00:14:36.086 A:middle
figure out that layout-- that we

00:14:36.086 --> 00:14:37.626 A:middle
can get multiple columns if we

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:38.826 A:middle
change our item size.

00:14:39.506 --> 00:14:41.996 A:middle
So if we head back to Xcode, to

00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:44.446 A:middle
our layout here, and if we just

00:14:44.446 --> 00:14:46.986 A:middle
change how we're calculating our

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:47.976 A:middle
item size here.

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:50.886 A:middle
So I'm just going to remove this

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:52.156 A:middle
fit here, and I'm going to

00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:54.216 A:middle
replace it with something that

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:55.336 A:middle
does a little bit of extra math.

00:14:56.336 --> 00:14:57.926 A:middle
So I'm just starting out with

00:14:58.006 --> 00:14:59.896 A:middle
the same available width that I

00:14:59.896 --> 00:15:00.536 A:middle
had before.
