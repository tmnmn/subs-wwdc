00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:00.216 A:middle
frame of the attributes.

00:25:00.216 --> 00:25:02.396 A:middle
So if our attributes have a

00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:04.466 A:middle
frame that intersects our query

00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:06.566 A:middle
rect, we can return them.

00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:08.826 A:middle
Okay. So let's switch back to

00:25:08.826 --> 00:25:11.206 A:middle
the sim and see what our layout

00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:11.786 A:middle
looks like.

00:25:12.626 --> 00:25:14.106 A:middle
So I'm going to select one of

00:25:14.106 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
these feeds, and there you go.

00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:17.586 A:middle
We have our layout.

00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:19.086 A:middle
Our images are nicely loaded in

00:25:19.086 --> 00:25:21.146 A:middle
this fancy mosaic configuration,

00:25:21.146 --> 00:25:23.706 A:middle
and if we rotate to landscape,

00:25:23.706 --> 00:25:25.246 A:middle
you can see that our cells have

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:26.996 A:middle
resized so we've updated

00:25:26.996 --> 00:25:28.036 A:middle
everything correctly, we've

00:25:28.036 --> 00:25:29.466 A:middle
invalidated, which is great.

00:25:32.286 --> 00:25:36.876 A:middle
So this looks like our spec, but

00:25:36.876 --> 00:25:38.516 A:middle
that scrolling performance isn't

00:25:38.516 --> 00:25:39.306 A:middle
great, is it?

00:25:39.436 --> 00:25:39.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No.

00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:40.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No, it's pretty bad, huh.

00:25:41.826 --> 00:25:43.116 A:middle
So you might already have an

00:25:43.116 --> 00:25:44.286 A:middle
idea of what's going on here.

00:25:44.386 --> 00:25:45.536 A:middle
Let's switch back to the code

00:25:45.536 --> 00:25:47.946 A:middle
and see what might be happening.

00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:50.386 A:middle
So if we take a look at our

00:25:50.386 --> 00:25:51.666 A:middle
layout attributes or elements in

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:54.386 A:middle
rect here, remember that this

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:55.946 A:middle
method gets called frequently

00:25:55.946 --> 00:25:56.836 A:middle
during scrolling.

00:25:58.616 --> 00:26:01.376 A:middle
So this function here, which is
