00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.936 A:middle
They share very similar APIs.

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:03.416 A:middle
Okay, so if the layout is all

00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:05.766 A:middle
about the where content goes,

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:07.756 A:middle
the data source is the what.

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:08.986 A:middle
The content itself.

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:11.136 A:middle
Three core methods to think

00:07:11.136 --> 00:07:11.816 A:middle
about here.

00:07:11.816 --> 00:07:12.746 A:middle
The first one is optional,

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:13.686 A:middle
number of sections in

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:16.026 A:middle
CollectionView, and this one if

00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:16.986 A:middle
you don't provide it, we'll just

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:18.086 A:middle
assume you mean one.

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:21.446 A:middle
Similarly, we have number of

00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:22.966 A:middle
items in section, and this is

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:24.556 A:middle
going to tell you the number of

00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:25.346 A:middle
items in each individual

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:26.116 A:middle
section, because they can all

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:26.986 A:middle
have different numbers of items.

00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:29.026 A:middle
And then the last one, sell for

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:30.206 A:middle
item index path is where you

00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:31.546 A:middle
provide the actually content

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:32.456 A:middle
you're going to display to your

00:07:32.456 --> 00:07:32.836 A:middle
users.

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:35.686 A:middle
Okay. So that's the data source.

00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:37.736 A:middle
Okay, the final of our three

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:38.846 A:middle
topics we're going to talk about

00:07:39.086 --> 00:07:40.356 A:middle
before we dive into code with

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:42.086 A:middle
Mohammed is the Delegate.

00:07:42.726 --> 00:07:45.346 A:middle
Okay. So use of the Delegate is

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:45.786 A:middle
optional.

00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:48.576 A:middle
Now, CollectionView is a

00:07:48.576 --> 00:07:50.036 A:middle
subclass of UIScrollView.

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:52.256 A:middle
So we use the same Delegate

00:07:52.686 --> 00:07:54.276 A:middle
that's provided by the

00:07:54.276 --> 00:07:56.116 A:middle
ScrollView superclass, but we

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:56.696 A:middle
extend it.

00:07:57.526 --> 00:07:58.646 A:middle
So if you need to modify

00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:00.116 A:middle
scrolling behavior, you can do
