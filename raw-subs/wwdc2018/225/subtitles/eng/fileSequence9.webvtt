00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:00.216 A:middle
with a flow layout, I'm actually

00:09:00.216 --> 00:09:01.036 A:middle
going to subclass

00:09:01.036 --> 00:09:02.566 A:middle
CollectionViewFlowLayout because

00:09:02.566 --> 00:09:03.346 A:middle
we're going to do a little bit

00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:04.576 A:middle
of extra customization.

00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:06.596 A:middle
So I'm going to start out by

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:10.436 A:middle
creating an instance of my

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:12.066 A:middle
ColumnFlowLayout class, which

00:09:12.066 --> 00:09:12.916 A:middle
I've already prepared.

00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:15.276 A:middle
I'm going to use that instance

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:17.276 A:middle
to create my CollectionView.

00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:18.946 A:middle
I'm going to take that

00:09:18.946 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
CollectionView, and I'm going to

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:21.576 A:middle
set some view properties, like

00:09:21.576 --> 00:09:23.356 A:middle
auto resizing mask, background

00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:25.356 A:middle
color, and since it's the

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:26.876 A:middle
ScrollView, I can set some of

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:28.066 A:middle
it's ScrollView properties as

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:28.296 A:middle
well.

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
This is all just to get it to

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:31.126 A:middle
look and feel the way I want it

00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:33.086 A:middle
to look in our app.

00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:34.786 A:middle
After adding the CollectionView

00:09:34.786 --> 00:09:36.596 A:middle
to my view hierarchy, I'm going

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:38.816 A:middle
to register my PersonCell class

00:09:38.816 --> 00:09:40.706 A:middle
using its unique identifier with

00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.536 A:middle
CollectionView so we can get our

00:09:42.536 --> 00:09:45.126 A:middle
cell design to app.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.696 A:middle
And then I'm going to set the

00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:47.866 A:middle
view controller as the

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.586 A:middle
CollectionView's data source so

00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:51.186 A:middle
we can give it some information

00:09:51.186 --> 00:09:52.496 A:middle
about how many cells it's going

00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:54.616 A:middle
to display and what sort of data

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:55.556 A:middle
it's going to display in it's

00:09:55.556 --> 00:09:56.146 A:middle
cells.

00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:59.346 A:middle
And then I'm going to set it as

00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.956 A:middle
it's delegate as well, so we can
