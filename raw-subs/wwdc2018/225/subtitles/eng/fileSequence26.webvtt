00:25:58.616 --> 00:26:01.376 A:middle
So this function here, which is

00:26:01.376 --> 00:26:03.656 A:middle
filtering our entire array, you

00:26:03.656 --> 00:26:05.036 A:middle
might imagine can get really

00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:06.666 A:middle
expensive as the number of items

00:26:06.666 --> 00:26:08.096 A:middle
in our CollectionView increases.

00:26:08.416 --> 00:26:09.476 A:middle
So the more photos we have in

00:26:09.476 --> 00:26:11.106 A:middle
our app, the slower our

00:26:11.106 --> 00:26:12.316 A:middle
scrolling performance is going

00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:13.096 A:middle
to be.

00:26:14.296 --> 00:26:15.506 A:middle
So if you find yourself in a

00:26:15.506 --> 00:26:17.146 A:middle
situation like this, it helps to

00:26:17.146 --> 00:26:18.766 A:middle
step back and think about the

00:26:18.766 --> 00:26:20.776 A:middle
nature of your layout and think

00:26:20.776 --> 00:26:21.976 A:middle
about whether you can find any

00:26:21.976 --> 00:26:23.466 A:middle
optimization opportunities.

00:26:24.296 --> 00:26:28.476 A:middle
So our layout kind of demands

00:26:28.476 --> 00:26:31.226 A:middle
that every cell apps next to or

00:26:31.226 --> 00:26:32.856 A:middle
below it's preceding cell.

00:26:33.536 --> 00:26:34.976 A:middle
So this means that our

00:26:34.976 --> 00:26:37.926 A:middle
attributes are already sorted

00:26:37.926 --> 00:26:39.126 A:middle
within our cached attributes

00:26:39.126 --> 00:26:41.376 A:middle
array by their frame's minimum y

00:26:41.376 --> 00:26:41.736 A:middle
value.

00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:45.736 A:middle
So we have a sorted array, so we

00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:48.006 A:middle
can speed up our search by doing

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:49.206 A:middle
something like a binary search

00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:51.826 A:middle
as opposed to our linear filter

00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:52.506 A:middle
that we're doing now.

00:26:53.386 --> 00:26:57.786 A:middle
So let's remove our slow

00:26:57.786 --> 00:27:00.216 A:middle
implementation here, and let's
