00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:01.396 A:middle
view, and we're going to mimic

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:02.786 A:middle
what flow layout does when it

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.086 A:middle
lays out this content.

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:04.936 A:middle
All right.

00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:07.806 A:middle
So here's our first item, and we

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:10.036 A:middle
start at the top leading edge,

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.126 A:middle
and we start laying out our

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:14.326 A:middle
items along a line.

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:15.216 A:middle
Now look at this line.

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:17.106 A:middle
This line is orthogonal to the

00:05:17.106 --> 00:05:18.006 A:middle
scroll axis.

00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:18.976 A:middle
We're scrolling vertically, so

00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:20.126 A:middle
the line is horizontal.

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:22.796 A:middle
Okay, now notice here, we filled

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:24.266 A:middle
up the available space for items

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.646 A:middle
on that line, so now we're going

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:28.046 A:middle
to drop to the next line and

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:29.696 A:middle
continue laying out our content.

00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:32.306 A:middle
And finally, we drop to that

00:05:32.306 --> 00:05:34.846 A:middle
last line, and bingo, we got all

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:35.366 A:middle
our content.

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:38.596 A:middle
Now if I dropped some guides on

00:05:38.596 --> 00:05:39.976 A:middle
here to show highlight where

00:05:39.976 --> 00:05:41.556 A:middle
those lines are horizontal,

00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:43.256 A:middle
let's talk about some

00:05:43.256 --> 00:05:44.926 A:middle
definitions that we have for

00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:46.586 A:middle
ways to customize flow.

00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:49.436 A:middle
First up is the notion of line

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:49.986 A:middle
spacing.

00:05:50.906 --> 00:05:52.076 A:middle
And as you see the arrows here,

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.586 A:middle
the line spacing is going to be

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:54.656 A:middle
the space between these

00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:55.536 A:middle
horizontal lines.

00:05:56.676 --> 00:06:00.166 A:middle
Similarly, inter-item spacing is
