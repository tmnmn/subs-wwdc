00:31:59.516 --> 00:32:00.466 A:middle
your CollectionView updates

00:32:00.526 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
inside that CollectionView

00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:02.466 A:middle
update closure.

00:32:03.276 --> 00:32:04.566 A:middle
Now, what I'm saying for

00:32:04.566 --> 00:32:05.826 A:middle
CollectionView also applies for

00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:06.316 A:middle
TableView.

00:32:06.316 --> 00:32:07.386 A:middle
So if you got TableViews in your

00:32:07.386 --> 00:32:09.136 A:middle
apps, all this information is

00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:10.256 A:middle
going the same direction.

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:12.916 A:middle
Okay. So let's make some

00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:13.856 A:middle
observations here.

00:32:14.406 --> 00:32:16.136 A:middle
The CollectionView updates, when

00:32:16.136 --> 00:32:16.976 A:middle
you do inserts, moves, and

00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:19.186 A:middle
deletes, the ordering of those

00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:20.586 A:middle
do not matter in your update's

00:32:20.586 --> 00:32:21.016 A:middle
closure.

00:32:21.736 --> 00:32:22.556 A:middle
Put them anywhere you want.

00:32:23.666 --> 00:32:25.046 A:middle
Now however your data source

00:32:25.046 --> 00:32:26.176 A:middle
updates, when you're changing

00:32:26.176 --> 00:32:27.176 A:middle
the structure offer your data

00:32:27.176 --> 00:32:28.636 A:middle
source, which is backing that

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:31.306 A:middle
data source, or does matter.

00:32:32.456 --> 00:32:34.906 A:middle
Okay, so this is best served by

00:32:34.906 --> 00:32:36.146 A:middle
showing an example, so I'm going

00:32:36.146 --> 00:32:38.086 A:middle
to take a example of two arrays

00:32:38.086 --> 00:32:39.106 A:middle
that have three elements in

00:32:39.106 --> 00:32:40.566 A:middle
them, and we're going to

00:32:40.566 --> 00:32:41.946 A:middle
strengthen our intuition on this

00:32:41.946 --> 00:32:43.796 A:middle
and show a delete and an insert,

00:32:44.006 --> 00:32:45.406 A:middle
but we're going to do the first

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:46.916 A:middle
run through with the delete

00:32:46.996 --> 00:32:48.416 A:middle
first and the second delete

00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:48.846 A:middle
second.

00:32:48.846 --> 00:32:49.666 A:middle
We're going to reverse the

00:32:49.666 --> 00:32:51.196 A:middle
order, just to kind of

00:32:51.196 --> 00:32:52.156 A:middle
strengthen our intuition.

00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:53.076 A:middle
I do this all the time, draw

00:32:53.076 --> 00:32:53.646 A:middle
pictures, right.

00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:54.786 A:middle
All right.

00:32:54.786 --> 00:32:56.056 A:middle
So we deleted the first item,

00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:59.216 A:middle
and now we're going to insert at

00:32:59.296 --> 00:33:00.346 A:middle
index one.
