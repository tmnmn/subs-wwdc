00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:00.116 A:middle
scrolling behavior, you can do

00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:01.426 A:middle
it also against this same

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:03.826 A:middle
Delegate and also work with some

00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:06.216 A:middle
of the UICollectionViewDelegate

00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:08.496 A:middle
methods that provide things like

00:08:08.616 --> 00:08:09.686 A:middle
fine-grained control over

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:11.176 A:middle
highlighting and selection as

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:12.186 A:middle
the user interacts with your

00:08:12.186 --> 00:08:12.686 A:middle
content.

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
And we also got an API that

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.086 A:middle
let's you know, hey, something

00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:18.016 A:middle
came on screen.

00:08:18.016 --> 00:08:19.426 A:middle
WillDisplayItem and

00:08:19.426 --> 00:08:20.636 A:middle
DidEndDisplayingItem.

00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:24.816 A:middle
Okay. So those are the three

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:26.196 A:middle
core concepts we really need to

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:28.156 A:middle
talk about before we dive into

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:30.016 A:middle
code to get started with

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:30.936 A:middle
UICollectionView.

00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:32.775 A:middle
So let's switch over to the dev

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:34.226 A:middle
box with Mohammed and have him

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:35.395 A:middle
show us how it works.

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:35.846 A:middle
Mohammed.

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:38.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, so the first of

00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:40.596 A:middle
our two screens that column

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:42.706 A:middle
layout is a great use case for

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.626 A:middle
using CollectionViewFlowLayout.

00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:46.376 A:middle
We can probably accomplish

00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:47.896 A:middle
everything we need there, and it

00:08:47.896 --> 00:08:49.996 A:middle
would be a great way to get us

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:52.036 A:middle
started using UICollectionView.

00:08:54.596 --> 00:08:56.686 A:middle
So now while we could accomplish

00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:58.896 A:middle
the entire goal of our design

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:00.216 A:middle
with a flow layout, I'm actually
