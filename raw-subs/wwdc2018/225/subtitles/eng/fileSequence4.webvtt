00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:00.976 A:middle
directly, but rather subclasses

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:01.806 A:middle
of CollectionViewLayout are

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:02.726 A:middle
meant to be used.

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:05.646 A:middle
Fortunately, we provide one.

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:08.896 A:middle
UICollectionViewFlowLayout, and

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:09.736 A:middle
you're probably familiar with

00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:10.566 A:middle
this class if you used

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:11.376 A:middle
CollectionView before.

00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:13.736 A:middle
Now there's a lot of

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:15.026 A:middle
customization points on

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:16.776 A:middle
CollectionViewLayout including

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:17.906 A:middle
some properties that we'll talk

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:19.666 A:middle
about in a little bit, but you

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:21.176 A:middle
can also customize it using a

00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:23.646 A:middle
delegate, and we'll talk about

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:24.616 A:middle
the CollectionViewDelegate in a

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:25.346 A:middle
moment, but

00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:27.656 A:middle
CollectionViewFlowLayout will

00:04:28.216 --> 00:04:30.156 A:middle
specify additional things that

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:31.086 A:middle
extend that

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:32.026 A:middle
CollectionViewDelegate.

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:35.986 A:middle
Okay, so what's Flow all about?

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:37.746 A:middle
Well it's a line-based layout

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.946 A:middle
system, and because of this, it

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.796 A:middle
can cover a wide range of

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:43.146 A:middle
different designs that you might

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:43.666 A:middle
receive.

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:47.786 A:middle
All right, so what does line

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:48.286 A:middle
base mean?

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:49.176 A:middle
Well let's go through this.

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:51.406 A:middle
So the best way to explain what

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:54.416 A:middle
a line based system is like is

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.636 A:middle
to give an example, so let's do

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:55.856 A:middle
that.

00:04:56.556 --> 00:04:57.936 A:middle
Okay. So here we see, we've got

00:04:57.936 --> 00:04:59.486 A:middle
a vertical scrolling collection

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:01.396 A:middle
view, and we're going to mimic
