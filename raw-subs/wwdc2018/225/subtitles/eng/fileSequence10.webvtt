00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.956 A:middle
it's delegate as well, so we can

00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:02.066 A:middle
handle cell selection.

00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:04.196 A:middle
So now that we've gotten set up,

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:05.976 A:middle
we need to actually conform to

00:10:05.976 --> 00:10:07.216 A:middle
these two protocols.

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:10.036 A:middle
So let's start out by conforming

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:12.606 A:middle
to the data source, and we have

00:10:12.676 --> 00:10:14.176 A:middle
two required methods we need to

00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:14.816 A:middle
implement here.

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:17.906 A:middle
The first of these is number of

00:10:17.976 --> 00:10:20.656 A:middle
items in section where we can

00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:22.696 A:middle
just return the number of people

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:23.926 A:middle
or the number of items in our

00:10:23.926 --> 00:10:26.956 A:middle
people array to get our data

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:27.996 A:middle
model objects displayed.

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:30.586 A:middle
The second method we'll need to

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:31.566 A:middle
implement is

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:34.456 A:middle
CellForItemAtIndexPath where

00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:36.226 A:middle
we'll dequeue a cell from the

00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:37.726 A:middle
CollectionView using our unique

00:10:37.726 --> 00:10:41.106 A:middle
identifier, pass a person and

00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:42.526 A:middle
object that we get out of our

00:10:42.526 --> 00:10:43.976 A:middle
people array, to the cell to

00:10:44.136 --> 00:10:47.126 A:middle
actually display our data, and

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:48.576 A:middle
then return the cell.

00:10:50.426 --> 00:10:52.566 A:middle
And to wrap things up here,

00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:54.686 A:middle
we'll just need to implement one

00:10:54.756 --> 00:10:56.396 A:middle
optional method from the

00:10:56.396 --> 00:10:58.066 A:middle
Delegate protocol, so we can

00:10:58.066 --> 00:10:58.836 A:middle
handle selection.

00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:00.826 A:middle
So I'm just going to add
