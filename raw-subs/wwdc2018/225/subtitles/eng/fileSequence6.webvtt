00:05:56.676 --> 00:06:00.166 A:middle
Similarly, inter-item spacing is

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:01.726 A:middle
the space between the items

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.426 A:middle
along the layout line.

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:04.766 A:middle
And we have two properties on

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:06.176 A:middle
flow layout that let you specify

00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:07.996 A:middle
the minimums for both of these.

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:11.006 A:middle
Okay. So let's cement our

00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:12.156 A:middle
intuition a little bit and

00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:13.736 A:middle
rotate the whole thing, pi over

00:06:13.736 --> 00:06:15.786 A:middle
2, and let's start over at the

00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:17.276 A:middle
top leading edge.

00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:19.096 A:middle
Now, this one is scrolling

00:06:19.096 --> 00:06:20.756 A:middle
horizontally, right, so we're

00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:22.346 A:middle
going to have a vertical layout

00:06:22.346 --> 00:06:24.496 A:middle
line, and when we get to the

00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:25.606 A:middle
bottom of this area, we filled

00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:27.396 A:middle
out that line, back up to the

00:06:27.396 --> 00:06:27.716 A:middle
top.

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:29.906 A:middle
Okay. This pattern is pretty

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:30.676 A:middle
familiar now, right.

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:32.196 A:middle
There we go.

00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:33.386 A:middle
There's all our content.

00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:35.736 A:middle
Now we have our vertical layout

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:36.236 A:middle
lines.

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:38.856 A:middle
So now in this orientation, our

00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:40.596 A:middle
line spacing is this.

00:06:41.876 --> 00:06:44.046 A:middle
And our inter-item spacing is

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:44.426 A:middle
this.

00:06:45.266 --> 00:06:46.186 A:middle
It's key to remember when you're

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:47.086 A:middle
working with flow layout.

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:49.636 A:middle
Okay, so that's layout.

00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:52.316 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about

00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:54.996 A:middle
the data source, and if you work

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:56.746 A:middle
with TableView, this should look

00:06:56.746 --> 00:06:57.486 A:middle
very familiar.

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:58.606 A:middle
It's a very similar pattern.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.936 A:middle
They share very similar APIs.
