00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:01.386 A:middle
Why don't we switch back over to

00:29:01.386 --> 00:29:03.616 A:middle
the dev machine, and Mohammed,

00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:04.686 A:middle
why don't you show us how this

00:29:04.686 --> 00:29:04.996 A:middle
works?

00:29:06.096 --> 00:29:08.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Sure thing.

00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:11.226 A:middle
Okay, so we're doing multiple

00:29:11.226 --> 00:29:12.746 A:middle
animated updates at the same

00:29:12.746 --> 00:29:13.216 A:middle
time.

00:29:14.036 --> 00:29:15.606 A:middle
So you might be aware of a great

00:29:15.606 --> 00:29:17.206 A:middle
tool that UICollectionView and

00:29:17.206 --> 00:29:19.576 A:middle
UITableView provide us, and it's

00:29:19.576 --> 00:29:21.236 A:middle
the Perform Batch Updates API,

00:29:21.936 --> 00:29:24.266 A:middle
which basically allows us to

00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:26.636 A:middle
pass the collection view a set

00:29:26.636 --> 00:29:28.036 A:middle
of updates that can be performed

00:29:28.036 --> 00:29:29.736 A:middle
at the same time with animation.

00:29:30.606 --> 00:29:33.226 A:middle
So I'm going to add a call to

00:29:33.486 --> 00:29:34.126 A:middle
CollectionView

00:29:34.186 --> 00:29:36.426 A:middle
PerformBatchUpdates, and note

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:37.646 A:middle
that I'm doing both my data

00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:38.896 A:middle
source updates and my

00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:40.126 A:middle
CollectionView updates in the

00:29:40.126 --> 00:29:40.856 A:middle
closure here.

00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:43.196 A:middle
This is really the best way that

00:29:43.196 --> 00:29:45.486 A:middle
I have of coordinating my

00:29:45.606 --> 00:29:47.576 A:middle
updates and keeping things

00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:48.806 A:middle
neatly in sync and avoiding

00:29:48.806 --> 00:29:49.676 A:middle
inconsistencies.

00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:53.356 A:middle
So, first I'm just updating my

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:57.586 A:middle
last item in my data source.

00:29:57.666 --> 00:29:59.476 A:middle
I'm removing the second to last

00:29:59.476 --> 00:30:01.316 A:middle
item, picking up the last item,
