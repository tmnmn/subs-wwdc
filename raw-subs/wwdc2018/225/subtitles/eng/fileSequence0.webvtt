&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon and

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.576 A:middle
welcome to a tour of

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:33.536 A:middle
UICollectionView.

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.556 A:middle
My name is Steve Breen-- I'll

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:36.726 A:middle
set this over here-- and I'm a

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:38.356 A:middle
frameworks engineer on the UIKit

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:38.686 A:middle
team.

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.516 A:middle
And I'm joined on stage today

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:42.896 A:middle
with my colleague, Mohammed

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.636 A:middle
Jisrawi, also on the UIKit team.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:49.836 A:middle
So today we're going to do

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:50.446 A:middle
something a little bit

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:50.936 A:middle
different.

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:52.966 A:middle
We're going to build an app from

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.296 A:middle
some specs we receive from our

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:55.496 A:middle
designer, Breanka [phonetic],

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:57.166 A:middle
and this is going to leverage

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.876 A:middle
many of the capabilities of

00:00:58.876 --> 00:00:59.756 A:middle
UICollectionView.
