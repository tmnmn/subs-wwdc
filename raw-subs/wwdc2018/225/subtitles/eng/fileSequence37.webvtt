00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:03.546 A:middle
batch updates, and here I'm just

00:37:04.506 --> 00:37:06.176 A:middle
updating my data source, again,

00:37:06.496 --> 00:37:07.966 A:middle
same as before, and calling

00:37:08.156 --> 00:37:09.216 A:middle
reload items on the

00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:09.806 A:middle
CollectionView.

00:37:10.336 --> 00:37:12.496 A:middle
I'm just performing it in a UI

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:14.156 A:middle
view performed without animation

00:37:14.686 --> 00:37:16.376 A:middle
closure because if you look

00:37:16.376 --> 00:37:18.336 A:middle
closely at our spec, it's

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:19.716 A:middle
actually nonanimated, that

00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:20.436 A:middle
initial reload.

00:37:22.026 --> 00:37:24.236 A:middle
Okay. So next up, we have to

00:37:24.236 --> 00:37:25.266 A:middle
take care of our remaining

00:37:25.266 --> 00:37:27.496 A:middle
updates, that delete and the

00:37:29.616 --> 00:37:29.716 A:middle
move.

00:37:29.936 --> 00:37:31.866 A:middle
And let's reason about them for

00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:32.386 A:middle
a second.

00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:35.766 A:middle
We have a delete at index two,

00:37:35.766 --> 00:37:38.176 A:middle
and then we're moving the item

00:37:38.176 --> 00:37:40.376 A:middle
at index three to index zero.

00:37:41.386 --> 00:37:43.256 A:middle
So if we break down our move

00:37:43.256 --> 00:37:44.886 A:middle
using the guidelines that we

00:37:44.886 --> 00:37:47.146 A:middle
just learned about, that becomes

00:37:47.146 --> 00:37:50.046 A:middle
a delete at index 2, a delete at

00:37:50.046 --> 00:37:53.506 A:middle
index 3, and an insertion of the

00:37:53.506 --> 00:37:56.066 A:middle
item from index 3 at index 0.

00:37:57.496 --> 00:37:59.576 A:middle
So now we have two sets of
