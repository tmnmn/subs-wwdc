00:29:59.476 --> 00:30:01.316 A:middle
item, picking up the last item,

00:30:01.316 --> 00:30:02.416 A:middle
moving it to the top, and then

00:30:02.416 --> 00:30:04.086 A:middle
I'm asking the CollectionView to

00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:05.736 A:middle
perform the animations that I

00:30:05.736 --> 00:30:05.926 A:middle
want.

00:30:06.766 --> 00:30:08.706 A:middle
Okay. Let's go back to the sim

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.336 A:middle
again and see what our update

00:30:10.336 --> 00:30:10.846 A:middle
looks like.

00:30:10.846 --> 00:30:13.166 A:middle
So I have wired our update code

00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:14.426 A:middle
through this update button at

00:30:14.426 --> 00:30:17.856 A:middle
the top right corner, and uh oh.

00:30:18.056 --> 00:30:19.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What's going on?

00:30:20.876 --> 00:30:23.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's embarrassing.

00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:25.456 A:middle
What's going on here.

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:26.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You know, I've been writing

00:30:26.126 --> 00:30:27.026 A:middle
iOS for a long time.

00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:28.596 A:middle
I've seen this movie before.

00:30:29.076 --> 00:30:31.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sucks when it

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:34.586 A:middle
happens on stage though.

00:30:34.586 --> 00:30:36.096 A:middle
You know, we're running out of

00:30:36.096 --> 00:30:37.756 A:middle
time here, so why don't we just

00:30:37.756 --> 00:30:39.256 A:middle
call reload data, and we can

00:30:39.636 --> 00:30:41.806 A:middle
come back and do the animations

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:41.966 A:middle
for V2.

00:30:41.966 --> 00:30:42.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:30:43.516 --> 00:30:47.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:48.316 --> 00:30:50.756 A:middle
You know, we could do that, but

00:30:50.756 --> 00:30:51.846 A:middle
then we'd lose that totally cool

00:30:51.846 --> 00:30:53.426 A:middle
update animation, and our users

00:30:53.426 --> 00:30:55.036 A:middle
expect these lively interfaces,

00:30:56.016 --> 00:30:56.206 A:middle
right?

00:30:56.666 --> 00:30:57.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:30:57.766 --> 00:30:58.286 A:middle
You know what?

00:30:58.286 --> 00:30:58.996 A:middle
They deserve better.

00:30:59.446 --> 00:31:00.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ah, I like the way you think.
