00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:00.506 A:middle
another layout subclass that

00:21:00.506 --> 00:21:01.416 A:middle
we're going to use for this

00:21:01.416 --> 00:21:03.336 A:middle
layout, and you might notice

00:21:03.336 --> 00:21:04.426 A:middle
that it's a subclass of

00:21:04.426 --> 00:21:06.276 A:middle
UICollectionViewLayout directly,

00:21:06.276 --> 00:21:07.736 A:middle
not a subclass of

00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:09.906 A:middle
CollectionViewLayout, and this

00:21:09.906 --> 00:21:11.596 A:middle
is for the reasons that Steve

00:21:11.636 --> 00:21:13.786 A:middle
explained to us earlier are

00:21:14.146 --> 00:21:16.006 A:middle
UICollectionViewLayout doesn't

00:21:16.006 --> 00:21:17.356 A:middle
really meet the needs of our

00:21:17.356 --> 00:21:19.446 A:middle
custom mosaic design.

00:21:20.906 --> 00:21:22.076 A:middle
So the first thing I'm doing

00:21:22.076 --> 00:21:23.626 A:middle
here is I'm setting up a couple

00:21:23.626 --> 00:21:25.246 A:middle
of instance variables that I'm

00:21:25.246 --> 00:21:26.646 A:middle
going to use to hold onto some

00:21:26.646 --> 00:21:28.176 A:middle
key pieces of information that I

00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:29.366 A:middle
can refer to later.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.946 A:middle
The first of these is a content

00:21:32.946 --> 00:21:34.816 A:middle
bound CG rect, which I'm going

00:21:34.816 --> 00:21:37.476 A:middle
to use to keep a representative

00:21:37.516 --> 00:21:39.396 A:middle
bounds of all the items within

00:21:39.396 --> 00:21:40.226 A:middle
my CollectionView.

00:21:40.776 --> 00:21:43.366 A:middle
And the second is a cached

00:21:43.366 --> 00:21:44.636 A:middle
attributes array, which I'm

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.106 A:middle
going to use to hold onto my

00:21:46.516 --> 00:21:48.336 A:middle
layout attributes so I can refer

00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:49.606 A:middle
to them quickly when performance

00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:50.086 A:middle
matters.

00:21:51.496 --> 00:21:52.916 A:middle
So we're going to start out by

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:54.396 A:middle
implementing our prepare method

00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:55.836 A:middle
again for this layout.

00:21:56.846 --> 00:21:59.776 A:middle
Prepare is the ideal place to do

00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:01.116 A:middle
the bulk of our layout work
