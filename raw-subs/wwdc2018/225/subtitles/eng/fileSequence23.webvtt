00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:00.576 A:middle
We're going to put them in our

00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:01.936 A:middle
cached attributes array so we

00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:03.536 A:middle
can grab them quickly later on.

00:23:04.086 --> 00:23:06.486 A:middle
And the second is, we're going

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.406 A:middle
to union their frame with our

00:23:08.406 --> 00:23:10.426 A:middle
content bounds rect so that our

00:23:10.426 --> 00:23:11.726 A:middle
content bounds are kept up to

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:11.996 A:middle
date.

00:23:13.896 --> 00:23:15.266 A:middle
So now that our prepare is up

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:16.366 A:middle
and running, we need to

00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:18.546 A:middle
implement the remaining methods

00:23:18.546 --> 00:23:20.206 A:middle
in our layout that we need to

00:23:20.406 --> 00:23:21.536 A:middle
get everything working.

00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:25.686 A:middle
So the first of these is

00:23:25.686 --> 00:23:27.186 A:middle
CollectionView Content Size

00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:29.036 A:middle
where if we had done our job

00:23:29.036 --> 00:23:30.986 A:middle
right in Prepare, we can just

00:23:30.986 --> 00:23:32.466 A:middle
return our Content Bounds as

00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:33.006 A:middle
size.

00:23:35.556 --> 00:23:37.286 A:middle
Next is should invalidate layout

00:23:37.286 --> 00:23:38.306 A:middle
for bounds change.

00:23:39.576 --> 00:23:40.876 A:middle
Now since our layout doesn't

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:43.036 A:middle
have any elements that require

00:23:43.036 --> 00:23:44.946 A:middle
us to invalidate while we're

00:23:44.946 --> 00:23:47.486 A:middle
scrolling, so no floating

00:23:47.486 --> 00:23:48.966 A:middle
headers, no floating footers or

00:23:48.966 --> 00:23:49.566 A:middle
anything like that.

00:23:50.106 --> 00:23:50.916 A:middle
We only really want to

00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:51.896 A:middle
invalidate when our

00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:53.706 A:middle
CollectionView's bounds of size

00:23:53.706 --> 00:23:54.276 A:middle
changes.

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:56.276 A:middle
So we'll just return true if our

00:23:56.276 --> 00:23:58.076 A:middle
new bounds of size is not equal

00:23:58.076 --> 00:23:59.606 A:middle
to our CollectionView's bounds

00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:01.486 A:middle
of size, our current bounds of
