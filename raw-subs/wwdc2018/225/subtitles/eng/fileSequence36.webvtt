00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:00.826 A:middle
What about reload data?

00:36:00.826 --> 00:36:02.466 A:middle
And I know Mohammed said we

00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:03.396 A:middle
could just hit that and we're

00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:04.676 A:middle
done, and everybody laughed so

00:36:04.676 --> 00:36:05.586 A:middle
I'm pretty sure I yelled and

00:36:05.586 --> 00:36:07.456 A:middle
that's the case, but the thing

00:36:07.456 --> 00:36:08.606 A:middle
about reloaded data is you don't

00:36:08.606 --> 00:36:09.926 A:middle
get those great animations, and

00:36:09.926 --> 00:36:11.236 A:middle
this is really a sledge hammer

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:11.826 A:middle
approach.

00:36:12.516 --> 00:36:13.816 A:middle
So, and we really prefer the

00:36:13.816 --> 00:36:15.286 A:middle
apps to be lively and animated

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:16.146 A:middle
and feel great for our

00:36:16.146 --> 00:36:16.686 A:middle
customers.

00:36:16.686 --> 00:36:19.036 A:middle
So, and this is used in special

00:36:19.036 --> 00:36:19.496 A:middle
cases.

00:36:20.356 --> 00:36:21.576 A:middle
Okay, Mohammed, let's switch

00:36:21.576 --> 00:36:23.416 A:middle
back over real quick and see if

00:36:23.416 --> 00:36:24.536 A:middle
we can get this fixed in code

00:36:24.536 --> 00:36:26.046 A:middle
and save that totally cool

00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:27.236 A:middle
update animation.

00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:28.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, time to redeem

00:36:28.546 --> 00:36:29.666 A:middle
myself.

00:36:29.666 --> 00:36:29.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:36:29.766 --> 00:36:32.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So let's use the guidelines

00:36:32.066 --> 00:36:33.446 A:middle
that Steve just shared with us

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:34.966 A:middle
to fix our update animation.

00:36:35.156 --> 00:36:36.756 A:middle
So let's remove our existing

00:36:36.756 --> 00:36:37.556 A:middle
implementation here.

00:36:37.746 --> 00:36:40.456 A:middle
And if you recall, our update

00:36:40.456 --> 00:36:44.066 A:middle
consisted of a reload, a delete

00:36:44.066 --> 00:36:46.916 A:middle
and a move, and our reload and

00:36:46.916 --> 00:36:48.876 A:middle
the move were at the same index

00:36:48.876 --> 00:36:49.086 A:middle
path.

00:36:49.296 --> 00:36:50.386 A:middle
They started at the same one.

00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:51.286 A:middle
So that's really where our

00:36:51.286 --> 00:36:52.326 A:middle
conflict is.

00:36:52.796 --> 00:36:54.316 A:middle
So we'll need to start out by

00:36:54.436 --> 00:36:55.396 A:middle
separating those two.

00:36:55.956 --> 00:36:57.926 A:middle
So let's take our reload out

00:36:57.926 --> 00:36:59.706 A:middle
into its own call to perform

00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:03.546 A:middle
batch updates, and here I'm just
