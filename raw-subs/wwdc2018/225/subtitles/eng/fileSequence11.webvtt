00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:00.826 A:middle
So I'm just going to add

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:04.226 A:middle
DidSelectItemAtIndexPath where

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:06.186 A:middle
we'll just instantiate our

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:07.716 A:middle
FeedView controller, which is

00:11:07.716 --> 00:11:09.246 A:middle
going to be our second screen if

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:10.056 A:middle
we don't already have an

00:11:10.056 --> 00:11:11.886 A:middle
instance, and then we're going

00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:14.406 A:middle
to pass it a person object so we

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:16.566 A:middle
know whose images to display,

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:19.386 A:middle
and then we'll push it onto our

00:11:19.386 --> 00:11:20.366 A:middle
navigation controller.

00:11:21.256 --> 00:11:24.136 A:middle
Okay. So let's build this and

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:27.006 A:middle
switch to the simulator to see.

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:29.976 A:middle
All right.

00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:33.606 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:35.836 A:middle
Okay. So we have our

00:11:35.836 --> 00:11:37.446 A:middle
CollectionView on screen here,

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:39.816 A:middle
and we have some cells.

00:11:39.816 --> 00:11:41.196 A:middle
You can see them, though they're

00:11:41.196 --> 00:11:42.096 A:middle
kind of squished.

00:11:42.146 --> 00:11:44.026 A:middle
They're not the right size, so

00:11:44.026 --> 00:11:45.116 A:middle
we're going to have to do some

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:46.786 A:middle
of that customization we thought

00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:47.656 A:middle
we might need to do.

00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:51.066 A:middle
So let's go back to Xcode, and

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:55.916 A:middle
let's pop open our column of

00:11:55.996 --> 00:11:59.906 A:middle
class here, our ColumnFlowLayout
