00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:02.086 A:middle
Now, while we work through all

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:03.916 A:middle
the tasks required to build our

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:05.266 A:middle
app, we're going to touch on a

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.466 A:middle
wide range of topics regarding

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.616 A:middle
UICollectionView including

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:10.916 A:middle
layouts, updates, and

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:11.606 A:middle
animations.

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:14.026 A:middle
So we've got a ton of ground to

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.326 A:middle
cover, so let's jump right in.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.106 A:middle
All right, so here's the first

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:20.526 A:middle
spec we got from our designer.

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:21.916 A:middle
It looks like a friends feed,

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:22.406 A:middle
imagine that.

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:24.336 A:middle
A great little columnar layout.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:28.826 A:middle
It looks pretty straightforward,

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:28.976 A:middle
okay.

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:30.086 A:middle
Okay, this looks great.

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:31.526 A:middle
So here we've got this really

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:33.296 A:middle
fancy looking mosaic layout,

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:34.786 A:middle
which is the contents of our

00:01:34.786 --> 00:01:35.436 A:middle
friends feed.

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:37.966 A:middle
Okay, so Mohammed, since you're

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.826 A:middle
going to be writing all the code

00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:39.936 A:middle
for us and walking us through

00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:41.806 A:middle
how to use these features, what

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:42.476 A:middle
are your thoughts on these

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:43.046 A:middle
designs?

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:44.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I'm seeing

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:45.526 A:middle
these for the first time, but

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:47.346 A:middle
they seem like great candidates

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:48.096 A:middle
for collection view.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.186 A:middle
I think we can have a lot of fun

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:50.146 A:middle
with this one, especially.

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:50.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one looks great.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:52.746 A:middle
All right.

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.626 A:middle
So before we dive into code, and

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:56.686 A:middle
Mohammed starts walking us

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.566 A:middle
through this, we need to cover

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.196 A:middle
three core concepts we need to
