00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
We've got that vertical stack to

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:01.296 A:middle
contend with.

00:17:01.296 --> 00:17:03.056 A:middle
So this really is not going to

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.326 A:middle
work for Flow because it turns

00:17:04.326 --> 00:17:07.226 A:middle
out it's not really a line-based

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:08.656 A:middle
layout, this fancy layout of

00:17:08.656 --> 00:17:08.986 A:middle
ours.

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:10.766 A:middle
But going through this exercise

00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:12.205 A:middle
is useful, so, you know, let's

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:13.566 A:middle
start with flow first.

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:16.776 A:middle
Okay. So in this instance, we're

00:17:16.776 --> 00:17:18.136 A:middle
going to create our own custom

00:17:18.136 --> 00:17:18.506 A:middle
layout.

00:17:19.685 --> 00:17:20.796 A:middle
Oh, no, we're scared, right.

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:21.876 A:middle
Nope, it's not complicated.

00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:23.925 A:middle
We've got four basic methods to

00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:25.356 A:middle
deal with here, and I'm going to

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:27.056 A:middle
bring up one additional method

00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:28.276 A:middle
that gets an honorable mention.

00:17:29.676 --> 00:17:31.156 A:middle
Okay. So four methods.

00:17:31.156 --> 00:17:31.566 A:middle
Here we go.

00:17:32.836 --> 00:17:34.076 A:middle
Our first method I want to talk

00:17:34.076 --> 00:17:35.106 A:middle
about is the CollectionView

00:17:35.106 --> 00:17:36.346 A:middle
Content Size.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.286 A:middle
Now, recall before we mentioned

00:17:39.286 --> 00:17:40.736 A:middle
CollectionView is a subclass of

00:17:40.736 --> 00:17:42.126 A:middle
UIScrollView, and one of the

00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:44.036 A:middle
features of UIScrollView is that

00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:45.576 A:middle
you have a visible region with a

00:17:45.576 --> 00:17:47.636 A:middle
large content area, and you get

00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:49.096 A:middle
that great iOS experience of

00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:50.596 A:middle
moving your content around

00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:52.666 A:middle
inside that, and so

00:17:52.756 --> 00:17:53.896 A:middle
CollectionView needs to know how

00:17:53.896 --> 00:17:55.396 A:middle
to tell the ScrollView, hey,

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:56.836 A:middle
here's how big my content is.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.256 A:middle
Okay. So how do we get this

00:17:59.256 --> 00:17:59.856 A:middle
size?
