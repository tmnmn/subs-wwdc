00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:01.486 A:middle
of size, our current bounds of

00:24:01.486 --> 00:24:01.856 A:middle
size.

00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:05.366 A:middle
After that, we'll implement

00:24:05.366 --> 00:24:06.616 A:middle
LayoutAttributesForItem

00:24:06.616 --> 00:24:08.846 A:middle
AtIndexPath where, again, since

00:24:08.846 --> 00:24:09.886 A:middle
we've prepared all the

00:24:09.886 --> 00:24:10.906 A:middle
attributes in our Prepare

00:24:10.906 --> 00:24:12.846 A:middle
method, we can just grab the

00:24:12.846 --> 00:24:14.526 A:middle
specific attributes that

00:24:14.526 --> 00:24:15.616 A:middle
correspond to the

00:24:15.786 --> 00:24:17.626 A:middle
RequestAtIndexPath from our

00:24:17.626 --> 00:24:17.936 A:middle
array.

00:24:18.116 --> 00:24:20.756 A:middle
And finally, we're going to

00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:21.236 A:middle
implement

00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:23.786 A:middle
LayoutAttributesForElements

00:24:23.786 --> 00:24:24.166 A:middle
InRect.

00:24:25.316 --> 00:24:26.776 A:middle
Now this method is called

00:24:26.776 --> 00:24:27.656 A:middle
periodically by the

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:29.096 A:middle
CollectionView with different

00:24:29.096 --> 00:24:31.676 A:middle
query rects, which may be bigger

00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:32.486 A:middle
than our CollectionView.

00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:34.136 A:middle
Our CollectionView is just

00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:36.566 A:middle
asking for a set of attributes

00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:37.926 A:middle
that match a certain region.

00:24:38.676 --> 00:24:41.746 A:middle
It's our job to return an array

00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:44.386 A:middle
that contains all the attributes

00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:46.266 A:middle
that correspond to all the items

00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:47.576 A:middle
that are going to appear within

00:24:47.576 --> 00:24:48.866 A:middle
that rect in our CollectionView.

00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:52.766 A:middle
So we can answer that question

00:24:52.846 --> 00:24:54.836 A:middle
here simply by filtering our

00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:57.616 A:middle
cached attributes array on the

00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:00.216 A:middle
frame of the attributes.
