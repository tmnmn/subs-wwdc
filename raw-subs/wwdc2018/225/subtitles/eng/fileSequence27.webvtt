00:26:57.786 --> 00:27:00.216 A:middle
implementation here, and let's

00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:01.026 A:middle
replace it with something that

00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:01.936 A:middle
should be much faster.

00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:06.196 A:middle
So I'm going to step through

00:27:06.196 --> 00:27:07.226 A:middle
this bit by bit, don't worry.

00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:10.066 A:middle
So the first thing we're doing

00:27:10.066 --> 00:27:12.606 A:middle
here is we're calling into

00:27:13.476 --> 00:27:15.136 A:middle
binary search function that

00:27:15.316 --> 00:27:16.656 A:middle
we've already prepared, which

00:27:16.656 --> 00:27:17.986 A:middle
takes in a range of indices

00:27:17.986 --> 00:27:20.526 A:middle
within our array and our query

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:20.806 A:middle
rect.

00:27:22.276 --> 00:27:25.956 A:middle
If it finds a set of attributes

00:27:25.956 --> 00:27:27.086 A:middle
with a frame that sits within

00:27:27.086 --> 00:27:28.706 A:middle
our rect, it'll return the

00:27:28.706 --> 00:27:30.586 A:middle
attributes as index within our

00:27:30.586 --> 00:27:30.806 A:middle
array.

00:27:32.716 --> 00:27:34.616 A:middle
Then starting from that index,

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:36.856 A:middle
we can build up the set of the

00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:39.016 A:middle
rest of attributes for our query

00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:41.736 A:middle
rect simply by looping up and

00:27:41.736 --> 00:27:43.736 A:middle
down in our array and picking up

00:27:43.736 --> 00:27:46.376 A:middle
attributes until we exit our

00:27:46.376 --> 00:27:47.506 A:middle
query rect, until we find

00:27:47.506 --> 00:27:49.016 A:middle
attributes that are outside our

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:49.176 A:middle
rect.

00:27:49.886 --> 00:27:51.466 A:middle
And this should be much faster.

00:27:51.946 --> 00:27:53.056 A:middle
You have thousands of items in

00:27:53.056 --> 00:27:53.416 A:middle
your array.

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:55.276 A:middle
You're not going to loop through

00:27:55.276 --> 00:27:56.566 A:middle
the array thousands of items,

00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:57.886 A:middle
thousands of times.

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.626 A:middle
Okay, so let's go back to the
