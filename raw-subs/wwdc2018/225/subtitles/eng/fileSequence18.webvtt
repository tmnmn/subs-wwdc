00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:01.986 A:middle
Well, if you imagine a rectangle

00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:03.546 A:middle
that encompassed all the content

00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:04.646 A:middle
that the layout is going to

00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:06.196 A:middle
define for your CollectionView,

00:18:06.626 --> 00:18:09.406 A:middle
we want the size of that.

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:11.596 A:middle
Okay, so that's CollectionView

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:12.436 A:middle
Content Size.

00:18:13.556 --> 00:18:15.326 A:middle
Next up we have two methods that

00:18:15.326 --> 00:18:17.176 A:middle
are in the business of providing

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:18.246 A:middle
layout attributes.

00:18:19.376 --> 00:18:20.516 A:middle
The first one is

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:21.826 A:middle
LayoutAttributesForElements (in

00:18:21.826 --> 00:18:22.116 A:middle
Rect).

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.606 A:middle
Now this is called periodically

00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:25.996 A:middle
by CollectionView when it needs

00:18:25.996 --> 00:18:26.856 A:middle
to know what is needed to

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.336 A:middle
display on screen as the user

00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:29.696 A:middle
scrolls through your content or

00:18:29.696 --> 00:18:30.916 A:middle
displays for the first time.

00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:33.516 A:middle
So this query is by a geometric

00:18:33.516 --> 00:18:33.966 A:middle
region.

00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:38.166 A:middle
Okay. It's companion API,

00:18:38.276 --> 00:18:39.596 A:middle
LayoutAttributesForItem

00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:42.046 A:middle
AtIndexPath, as you can imagine,

00:18:42.046 --> 00:18:43.096 A:middle
it's just looking for a single

00:18:43.096 --> 00:18:43.366 A:middle
item.

00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:44.876 A:middle
Give me the attributes for that.

00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:47.416 A:middle
Okay, so we're going to see more

00:18:47.416 --> 00:18:48.446 A:middle
when Mohammed walks us through

00:18:48.446 --> 00:18:50.116 A:middle
this, but for these two APIs,

00:18:50.116 --> 00:18:51.326 A:middle
it's important to note that

00:18:51.326 --> 00:18:52.936 A:middle
performance matters.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.956 A:middle
Okay, so the fourth of our four

00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:01.906 A:middle
core custom layout subclass
