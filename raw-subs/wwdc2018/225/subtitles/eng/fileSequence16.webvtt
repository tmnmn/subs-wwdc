00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:00.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No.

00:16:00.536 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What's next in our design?

00:16:02.036 --> 00:16:02.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, now that we've eased

00:16:02.906 --> 00:16:04.366 A:middle
ourselves in with our friends

00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:05.446 A:middle
list, it's time to start

00:16:05.446 --> 00:16:07.846 A:middle
thinking about that fancy mosaic

00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:08.306 A:middle
layout for [inaudible].

00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:08.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:09.566 A:middle
That's going to be great.

00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:09.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:09.676 --> 00:16:10.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's switch back over

00:16:10.816 --> 00:16:13.076 A:middle
slides, and let's chat a little

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:16.926 A:middle
bit about that.

00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:19.726 A:middle
Okay. So let's take a look at

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:21.686 A:middle
this layout or design here and

00:16:21.686 --> 00:16:22.506 A:middle
see what we can do.

00:16:22.506 --> 00:16:23.816 A:middle
So our first inclination, I

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.006 A:middle
don't know about yours, but mine

00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:25.956 A:middle
would be can I use Flow.

00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:26.626 A:middle
I've got it.

00:16:26.626 --> 00:16:27.216 A:middle
It's ready to go.

00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:28.036 A:middle
Let's try to use it.

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:30.796 A:middle
So let's zero in on this design

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:32.786 A:middle
a little bit and see if Flow is

00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:33.946 A:middle
going to make sense for us.

00:16:34.966 --> 00:16:36.726 A:middle
And this particular region where

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:37.886 A:middle
these three photos are, I'm

00:16:37.886 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
going to zoom in on that real

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:39.626 A:middle
quick.

00:16:40.276 --> 00:16:40.626 A:middle
All right.

00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:43.496 A:middle
So now in this instance we have

00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:45.206 A:middle
a very large photo on the left

00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:47.306 A:middle
and then a vertical stack on the

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:47.656 A:middle
right.

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:49.836 A:middle
So in the flow universe, since

00:16:49.836 --> 00:16:50.886 A:middle
it's line based, we're going to

00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:52.446 A:middle
lay out that large left item,

00:16:53.076 --> 00:16:54.186 A:middle
move over to the next item where

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:55.306 A:middle
it's got room, try to lay out

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.386 A:middle
another item, and then jump to

00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:58.116 A:middle
the next line.

00:16:58.606 --> 00:16:59.686 A:middle
But we're not done.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
We've got that vertical stack to
