00:38:00.196 --> 00:38:00.836 A:middle
operations.

00:38:00.836 --> 00:38:01.926 A:middle
We have deletions and

00:38:01.926 --> 00:38:02.766 A:middle
insertions.

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:04.826 A:middle
We can process them accordingly.

00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:07.246 A:middle
First, we'll perform our

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:08.776 A:middle
deletions in descending order.

00:38:08.946 --> 00:38:11.516 A:middle
So we'll do our deletion at

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.756 A:middle
index 3 first, and will hold

00:38:13.756 --> 00:38:15.546 A:middle
onto the person from there so we

00:38:15.546 --> 00:38:16.476 A:middle
can insert them later on.

00:38:17.376 --> 00:38:19.956 A:middle
And then we'll delete the item

00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:22.876 A:middle
at index 2.

00:38:23.126 --> 00:38:24.756 A:middle
Then we'll need to process our

00:38:24.756 --> 00:38:26.366 A:middle
insertions in ascending order.

00:38:26.526 --> 00:38:27.916 A:middle
We just have one, so we can just

00:38:27.916 --> 00:38:30.266 A:middle
go ahead and insert it.

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:31.586 A:middle
And finally, we'll ask the

00:38:31.586 --> 00:38:34.296 A:middle
CollectionView to perform the

00:38:34.296 --> 00:38:35.446 A:middle
animations that we want.

00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:38.466 A:middle
Now, note, I'm still calling

00:38:38.466 --> 00:38:39.116 A:middle
move here.

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:40.966 A:middle
I didn't break it down into it's

00:38:40.966 --> 00:38:42.726 A:middle
component actions because we

00:38:42.726 --> 00:38:43.836 A:middle
still want the collection view

00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:45.476 A:middle
to play the right animations,

00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:46.296 A:middle
and if we've done the right

00:38:46.386 --> 00:38:47.906 A:middle
thing with our data source, the

00:38:47.906 --> 00:38:49.086 A:middle
CollectionView will do the right

00:38:49.156 --> 00:38:50.616 A:middle
think in terms of animations.

00:38:51.376 --> 00:38:51.756 A:middle
All right.

00:38:51.846 --> 00:38:53.826 A:middle
Let's go back to the simulator

00:38:53.826 --> 00:38:56.826 A:middle
and see what our update looks

00:38:56.826 --> 00:38:58.066 A:middle
like when it works.

00:38:58.936 --> 00:38:59.966 A:middle
All right.
