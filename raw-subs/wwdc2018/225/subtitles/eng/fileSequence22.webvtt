00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:01.116 A:middle
the bulk of our layout work

00:22:01.326 --> 00:22:03.086 A:middle
because it's getting called once

00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:04.086 A:middle
per invalidation.

00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:06.616 A:middle
We can set up our layout here

00:22:06.756 --> 00:22:08.696 A:middle
and then avoid having to do any

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:10.626 A:middle
heavy layout work or any heavy

00:22:10.626 --> 00:22:12.776 A:middle
layout math in the methods that

00:22:12.776 --> 00:22:13.976 A:middle
are called much more frequently.

00:22:18.486 --> 00:22:19.226 A:middle
So we're doing a couple of

00:22:19.226 --> 00:22:19.696 A:middle
things here.

00:22:19.956 --> 00:22:21.836 A:middle
First, we're resetting our

00:22:21.836 --> 00:22:23.086 A:middle
cached attributes and our

00:22:23.086 --> 00:22:24.816 A:middle
content bounds just to clear out

00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:26.956 A:middle
any stale information from

00:22:26.956 --> 00:22:28.276 A:middle
previous invalidations.

00:22:29.576 --> 00:22:32.196 A:middle
Next, we're doing a few things

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:33.426 A:middle
for every item in our

00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:34.056 A:middle
CollectionView.

00:22:35.346 --> 00:22:36.736 A:middle
The first of these is actually

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:38.536 A:middle
preparing the attributes, and

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:39.626 A:middle
now I'm not going to go too

00:22:39.626 --> 00:22:41.506 A:middle
deeply into what that entails

00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:42.836 A:middle
for our specific layout because

00:22:42.836 --> 00:22:43.676 A:middle
this is going to be different

00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:44.076 A:middle
for you.

00:22:44.466 --> 00:22:46.376 A:middle
This is where you are going to

00:22:46.376 --> 00:22:47.606 A:middle
calculate the sizes and

00:22:47.606 --> 00:22:49.506 A:middle
positions and transforms, etc.,

00:22:49.506 --> 00:22:52.116 A:middle
for your cells to match your

00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:52.976 A:middle
design needs.

00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:54.886 A:middle
But there are a couple of key

00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:55.646 A:middle
things that we're going to do

00:22:55.646 --> 00:22:57.076 A:middle
here after we are done with the

00:22:57.076 --> 00:22:57.706 A:middle
attributes.

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.266 A:middle
The first is, we're going to

00:22:59.266 --> 00:22:59.676 A:middle
cache them.

00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:00.576 A:middle
We're going to put them in our
