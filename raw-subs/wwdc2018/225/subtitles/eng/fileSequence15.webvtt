00:14:59.896 --> 00:15:00.536 A:middle
had before.

00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:02.466 A:middle
This is the bounds inset by the

00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:05.546 A:middle
margins, and some arbitrary

00:15:05.546 --> 00:15:07.726 A:middle
definition of what a minimum

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:10.726 A:middle
column width is, it's 300

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:11.156 A:middle
points.

00:15:11.696 --> 00:15:14.106 A:middle
And then taking both of those

00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:15.796 A:middle
values and using them to

00:15:15.796 --> 00:15:17.476 A:middle
calculate a maximum number of

00:15:17.476 --> 00:15:18.986 A:middle
column that I think I can fit

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.146 A:middle
within the available space, and

00:15:21.146 --> 00:15:23.096 A:middle
I'm taking that and dividing the

00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:24.536 A:middle
available width by it to

00:15:24.536 --> 00:15:26.546 A:middle
calculate an optimal cell width,

00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:29.446 A:middle
which might be more than our 300

00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:29.816 A:middle
points.

00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:32.346 A:middle
I'm then passing that to the CT

00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:33.636 A:middle
size that I'm using as my item

00:15:33.636 --> 00:15:33.966 A:middle
size.

00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:37.166 A:middle
Okay. So let's go back to our

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:39.546 A:middle
simulator again and see what our

00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:40.676 A:middle
updated layout looks like.

00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:43.596 A:middle
Okay. So everything is the same

00:15:43.596 --> 00:15:43.806 A:middle
here.

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:44.466 A:middle
We didn't break it.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.756 A:middle
It's a good start, and if we go

00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:50.146 A:middle
to portrait, there are our

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:51.416 A:middle
multiple columns side by side,

00:15:51.536 --> 00:15:52.136 A:middle
just what we want.

00:15:53.436 --> 00:15:55.186 A:middle
What do you think, Steve?

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:56.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That looks great.

00:15:56.306 --> 00:15:57.596 A:middle
We got a great adaptable

00:15:57.596 --> 00:15:58.706 A:middle
columnar base layout.

00:15:58.706 --> 00:15:59.726 A:middle
Not a lot of work.
