00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:01.906 A:middle
core custom layout subclass

00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:03.766 A:middle
items is going to be the Prepare

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:04.106 A:middle
method.

00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:05.396 A:middle
Now Mohammed has already chatted

00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:06.706 A:middle
about this a little bit.

00:19:06.706 --> 00:19:08.266 A:middle
This is called every time the

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:09.346 A:middle
layout is invalidated.

00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:11.226 A:middle
So this is a great time to

00:19:11.226 --> 00:19:12.436 A:middle
compute anything, such as your

00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:13.486 A:middle
layout attributes you might want

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.206 A:middle
to cache and also your content

00:19:16.206 --> 00:19:17.496 A:middle
size, which is going to be asked

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:18.976 A:middle
for pretty soon afterwards.

00:19:23.456 --> 00:19:25.326 A:middle
Okay. So our honorable mention

00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:26.876 A:middle
APIs, so let's talk about this

00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:27.066 A:middle
one.

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.316 A:middle
This is a Should Invalidate

00:19:28.316 --> 00:19:29.856 A:middle
Layout For Bounds Change.

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:33.046 A:middle
So this is called every time the

00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:34.126 A:middle
bounds in the CollectionView

00:19:34.126 --> 00:19:34.876 A:middle
changes.

00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:36.366 A:middle
Okay, so again, it's a

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:37.926 A:middle
CollectionView is a UIScrollView

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:38.566 A:middle
subclass.

00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:40.676 A:middle
So what do we mean by a bounds

00:19:40.676 --> 00:19:41.216 A:middle
change?

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:43.206 A:middle
Well, when a ScrollView bounds

00:19:43.206 --> 00:19:45.406 A:middle
change, the origin can change

00:19:45.406 --> 00:19:47.246 A:middle
during a scrolling, and also the

00:19:47.246 --> 00:19:48.546 A:middle
size can change when the

00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:50.366 A:middle
application size changes or the

00:19:50.366 --> 00:19:51.726 A:middle
CollectionView size changes.

00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:53.256 A:middle
So this is going to be called

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:53.996 A:middle
during scrolling.

00:19:55.116 --> 00:19:56.996 A:middle
Hence the oh yeah emoji.

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:58.196 A:middle
This is called very often.

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:00.126 A:middle
So making the right decision
