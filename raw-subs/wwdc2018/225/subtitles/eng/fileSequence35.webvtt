00:34:59.106 --> 00:35:00.946 A:middle
really doing can kind of tell us

00:35:00.946 --> 00:35:02.426 A:middle
a little bit of what's going on

00:35:02.756 --> 00:35:04.466 A:middle
with our error in our app

00:35:05.476 --> 00:35:06.516 A:middle
because of the delete on the

00:35:06.516 --> 00:35:07.696 A:middle
reload on the last one is

00:35:07.696 --> 00:35:09.026 A:middle
conflicting internally with the

00:35:09.026 --> 00:35:10.376 A:middle
notion of moving that item,

00:35:10.476 --> 00:35:10.796 A:middle
okay.

00:35:10.846 --> 00:35:12.006 A:middle
So we can address this in a

00:35:12.006 --> 00:35:14.396 A:middle
minute when we get back to code.

00:35:14.396 --> 00:35:15.906 A:middle
Okay, so I'm not going to go

00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:16.856 A:middle
through these, but you can

00:35:16.856 --> 00:35:17.866 A:middle
reason about these later.

00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:18.996 A:middle
Just put it up here as reference

00:35:18.996 --> 00:35:19.706 A:middle
that these are the things

00:35:19.706 --> 00:35:21.596 A:middle
that'll cause CollectionView to

00:35:21.596 --> 00:35:22.346 A:middle
go bonkers.

00:35:22.726 --> 00:35:23.576 A:middle
Don't do it.

00:35:23.716 --> 00:35:27.486 A:middle
And how can we take all this

00:35:27.486 --> 00:35:29.176 A:middle
knowledge and simplify it,

00:35:29.176 --> 00:35:30.746 A:middle
distill it in such a way that we

00:35:30.746 --> 00:35:32.456 A:middle
can always apply our data source

00:35:32.456 --> 00:35:34.016 A:middle
updates from a given set of

00:35:34.016 --> 00:35:35.026 A:middle
CollectionView or TableView

00:35:35.026 --> 00:35:36.366 A:middle
updates and make sure everything

00:35:36.366 --> 00:35:36.826 A:middle
is in sync.

00:35:37.056 --> 00:35:37.426 A:middle
All right.

00:35:37.496 --> 00:35:38.796 A:middle
So these four basic rules.

00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:40.176 A:middle
So first of all you want to

00:35:40.176 --> 00:35:41.466 A:middle
decompose those moves and to

00:35:41.466 --> 00:35:42.336 A:middle
delete and inserts.

00:35:42.556 --> 00:35:44.776 A:middle
Easy. And then combine all your

00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:45.796 A:middle
deletes and inserts into two

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:48.536 A:middle
separate lists, process the

00:35:48.536 --> 00:35:50.546 A:middle
deletes first in descending

00:35:50.546 --> 00:35:52.396 A:middle
order on the index paths, and

00:35:52.396 --> 00:35:54.176 A:middle
then finally apply those inserts

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:55.356 A:middle
in the ascending index path

00:35:55.356 --> 00:35:55.636 A:middle
order.

00:35:55.776 --> 00:35:59.586 A:middle
Do this, and you're good to go.

00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:00.826 A:middle
What about reload data?
