00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:00.506 A:middle
So, we can just write out

00:32:00.506 --> 00:32:01.646 A:middle
explicitly collection and

00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:02.756 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection.

00:32:03.346 --> 00:32:05.066 A:middle
To assert that this is where all

00:32:05.066 --> 00:32:06.056 A:middle
these conformances are.

00:32:06.506 --> 00:32:07.936 A:middle
Or we can do the stylistically

00:32:07.936 --> 00:32:09.616 A:middle
better thing, and split out the

00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:10.556 A:middle
different conformances.

00:32:12.486 --> 00:32:13.726 A:middle
Now at this point, our range

00:32:13.726 --> 00:32:15.346 A:middle
type is pretty powerful.

00:32:15.346 --> 00:32:15.946 A:middle
It does everything the

00:32:15.946 --> 00:32:17.016 A:middle
countableRange does.

00:32:17.296 --> 00:32:17.976 A:middle
So what should we do with

00:32:17.976 --> 00:32:18.686 A:middle
countableRange?

00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:20.206 A:middle
We could throw it away.

00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:21.496 A:middle
In this case we're talking about

00:32:21.496 --> 00:32:23.066 A:middle
the standard library, and

00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:23.936 A:middle
there's a lot of code that

00:32:23.936 --> 00:32:25.706 A:middle
actually uses countableRange.

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:28.176 A:middle
So we can keep it around as a

00:32:28.176 --> 00:32:29.586 A:middle
generic type alias.

00:32:30.886 --> 00:32:32.476 A:middle
This is a really nice solution.

00:32:32.476 --> 00:32:34.466 A:middle
So the generic type alias adds

00:32:34.546 --> 00:32:35.886 A:middle
all of those extra requirements

00:32:35.886 --> 00:32:37.306 A:middle
you need to make the range

00:32:37.306 --> 00:32:37.806 A:middle
countable.

00:32:38.066 --> 00:32:39.276 A:middle
The requirements you need to

00:32:39.276 --> 00:32:42.056 A:middle
turn it into a collection, but

00:32:42.056 --> 00:32:43.366 A:middle
it's just an alternate name for

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:44.706 A:middle
the underlying range type.

00:32:46.826 --> 00:32:47.806 A:middle
Again, this is great for source

00:32:47.806 --> 00:32:49.166 A:middle
compatibility, because code can

00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:50.846 A:middle
still use countableRange.

00:32:51.116 --> 00:32:52.416 A:middle
On the other hand, it's also

00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:54.466 A:middle
really nice to give a name to

00:32:54.466 --> 00:32:56.046 A:middle
those ranges that have

00:32:56.046 --> 00:32:57.856 A:middle
additional capabilities of being

00:32:57.856 --> 00:32:59.286 A:middle
a randomAccessCollection.

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
In fact, we can use this to
