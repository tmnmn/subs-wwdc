00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:00.516 A:middle
subclasses.

00:49:00.986 --> 00:49:02.926 A:middle
So if I were to extend Vehicle

00:49:02.926 --> 00:49:04.376 A:middle
with a new method, to go let it

00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:07.066 A:middle
drive, I fully expect that I can

00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:08.736 A:middle
call that method on one of my

00:49:08.736 --> 00:49:10.086 A:middle
subclasses, Taxi.

00:49:11.016 --> 00:49:13.746 A:middle
So, this is a fundamental aspect

00:49:13.816 --> 00:49:15.426 A:middle
of object-oriented programming.

00:49:15.756 --> 00:49:17.356 A:middle
And, Barbara Liskov, actually

00:49:17.356 --> 00:49:18.836 A:middle
described this really well in a

00:49:18.836 --> 00:49:20.106 A:middle
lecture back in the '80s.

00:49:20.846 --> 00:49:21.726 A:middle
Since then, we've referred to

00:49:21.726 --> 00:49:23.656 A:middle
this as the Liskov substitution

00:49:23.656 --> 00:49:24.156 A:middle
principle.

00:49:24.516 --> 00:49:25.856 A:middle
And, the idea's actually fairly

00:49:25.856 --> 00:49:26.286 A:middle
simple.

00:49:26.886 --> 00:49:28.986 A:middle
So, if you have someplace in

00:49:28.986 --> 00:49:30.906 A:middle
your program that refers to a

00:49:30.906 --> 00:49:34.246 A:middle
supertype, or superclass, like

00:49:34.376 --> 00:49:34.796 A:middle
Vehicle.

00:49:35.956 --> 00:49:37.316 A:middle
You should be able to take an

00:49:37.316 --> 00:49:39.056 A:middle
instance of any of its subtypes,

00:49:39.056 --> 00:49:41.896 A:middle
or subclasses, like Taxi or

00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:44.346 A:middle
PoliceCar, and use that instead.

00:49:44.806 --> 00:49:45.966 A:middle
And the program should still

00:49:45.966 --> 00:49:47.436 A:middle
continue to type check and run

00:49:47.436 --> 00:49:47.996 A:middle
correctly.

00:49:48.746 --> 00:49:50.046 A:middle
So, the substitution here is an

00:49:50.046 --> 00:49:51.226 A:middle
instance of a subclass should be

00:49:51.226 --> 00:49:52.356 A:middle
able to go in anywhere that the

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:53.756 A:middle
superclass was expected and

00:49:53.756 --> 00:49:54.156 A:middle
tested.

00:49:54.156 --> 00:49:56.476 A:middle
And, this is a really simple

00:49:56.476 --> 00:49:56.896 A:middle
principle.

00:49:56.896 --> 00:49:58.396 A:middle
We've all internalized it, but

00:49:58.396 --> 00:50:00.026 A:middle
it's also really powerful.
