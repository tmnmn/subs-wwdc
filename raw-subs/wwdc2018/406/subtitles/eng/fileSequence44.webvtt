00:43:59.956 --> 00:44:01.496 A:middle
types are not necessarily the

00:44:01.496 --> 00:44:01.956 A:middle
same.

00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:04.296 A:middle
That's really inconvenient here

00:44:04.296 --> 00:44:05.356 A:middle
because it prevents us from

00:44:05.356 --> 00:44:06.646 A:middle
writing this nonrecursive

00:44:06.646 --> 00:44:07.116 A:middle
algorithm.

00:44:07.116 --> 00:44:09.326 A:middle
And it doesn't really reflect

00:44:09.386 --> 00:44:10.996 A:middle
how specific collection types

00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:11.506 A:middle
behave.

00:44:11.506 --> 00:44:12.706 A:middle
Think about string.

00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:15.376 A:middle
If you slice a string, you get a

00:44:15.376 --> 00:44:15.996 A:middle
substring.

00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:18.276 A:middle
If you slice a substring, you

00:44:18.276 --> 00:44:20.586 A:middle
don't get a sub-substring.

00:44:21.256 --> 00:44:23.286 A:middle
You just get another instance of

00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:24.296 A:middle
the substring type.

00:44:25.206 --> 00:44:27.196 A:middle
So let's go back to how this

00:44:27.196 --> 00:44:28.646 A:middle
slice adapter works to

00:44:28.646 --> 00:44:29.816 A:middle
generalize this notion.

00:44:30.306 --> 00:44:31.426 A:middle
We have a collection.

00:44:31.426 --> 00:44:32.426 A:middle
We're going to call it Self,

00:44:32.776 --> 00:44:34.606 A:middle
that we've sliced from I to J.

00:44:35.536 --> 00:44:36.576 A:middle
Now that's going to build

00:44:36.736 --> 00:44:37.996 A:middle
something of the type slice of

00:44:37.996 --> 00:44:38.506 A:middle
Self.

00:44:38.746 --> 00:44:40.676 A:middle
Which is just a view on the

00:44:40.676 --> 00:44:42.146 A:middle
underlying Self collection.

00:44:42.686 --> 00:44:45.276 A:middle
If we then slice the slice, we

00:44:45.276 --> 00:44:47.676 A:middle
get a slice of slice of self.

00:44:47.866 --> 00:44:50.586 A:middle
Which is a view of a view on

00:44:50.586 --> 00:44:52.576 A:middle
that same underlying Self

00:44:52.576 --> 00:44:53.246 A:middle
collection.

00:44:53.906 --> 00:44:55.646 A:middle
So this is our infinite tower of

00:44:55.646 --> 00:44:56.876 A:middle
types in practice.

00:44:57.346 --> 00:44:58.956 A:middle
However, it doesn't have to be

00:44:58.956 --> 00:44:59.446 A:middle
this way.
