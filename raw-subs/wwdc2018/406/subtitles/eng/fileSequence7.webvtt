00:06:59.126 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
more about the capabilities the

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:03.646 A:middle
element needs to have, in order

00:07:03.646 --> 00:07:05.636 A:middle
to make this method available on

00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:06.356 A:middle
a buffer.

00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:08.816 A:middle
Now, the easiest way to do that

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:10.626 A:middle
is by constraining the element

00:07:10.626 --> 00:07:12.386 A:middle
type to be a specific type like

00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:13.856 A:middle
the Int from our original loop.

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:18.366 A:middle
If you take this easy approach

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:19.396 A:middle
to get up and running with your

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:20.656 A:middle
extension, it's easy to

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:21.726 A:middle
generalize it later.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:22.926 A:middle
When you find that you need to

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:23.676 A:middle
do something different.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.296 A:middle
Like sum up a buffer of doubles,

00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:25.906 A:middle
or floats.

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.256 A:middle
Just look at the type that

00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:29.226 A:middle
you've constrained to.

00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:31.006 A:middle
Look at the protocols it

00:07:31.006 --> 00:07:31.656 A:middle
conforms to.

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:33.116 A:middle
And follow them up until you get

00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:34.816 A:middle
the most general protocol that

00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:35.736 A:middle
gives you everything that you

00:07:35.736 --> 00:07:36.626 A:middle
need to do your work.

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:39.206 A:middle
In this case, the numeric

00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:40.646 A:middle
protocol, which gives us the two

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:41.756 A:middle
things we're relying on here.

00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:44.876 A:middle
The ability to create a new

00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:46.596 A:middle
element with a value of zero,

00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:48.096 A:middle
and the ability to add elements

00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:48.476 A:middle
to it.

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:49.876 A:middle
Which come as part of the

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:50.676 A:middle
numeric protocol.

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:54.776 A:middle
Now, let's talk about that

00:07:54.776 --> 00:07:56.156 A:middle
process of factoring out

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.496 A:middle
protocols from various types.

00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:01.226 A:middle
So we've been talking about this
