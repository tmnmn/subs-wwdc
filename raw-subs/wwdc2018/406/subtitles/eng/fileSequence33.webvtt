00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
In fact, we can use this to

00:33:01.276 --> 00:33:02.206 A:middle
clean up other code.

00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:03.466 A:middle
To say, well, we know what a

00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:04.476 A:middle
countableRange is.

00:33:04.876 --> 00:33:06.876 A:middle
It's a range with this extra

00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:09.106 A:middle
striding capability, so we can

00:33:09.106 --> 00:33:10.616 A:middle
go extend countableRanges.

00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:12.776 A:middle
And that is a case in which we

00:33:12.776 --> 00:33:14.466 A:middle
have randomAccessCollection

00:33:14.466 --> 00:33:14.996 A:middle
conformance.

00:33:16.446 --> 00:33:17.426 A:middle
So, we've introduced this in

00:33:17.426 --> 00:33:19.866 A:middle
Swift 4.2 to help simplify the

00:33:19.866 --> 00:33:20.906 A:middle
set of types that we're dealing

00:33:20.906 --> 00:33:21.136 A:middle
with.

00:33:21.136 --> 00:33:22.706 A:middle
And make the existing core types

00:33:22.706 --> 00:33:24.656 A:middle
like range more composable and

00:33:24.656 --> 00:33:25.346 A:middle
more flexible.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:28.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Recursive constraints

00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:30.726 A:middle
describe relationships among

00:33:30.726 --> 00:33:32.316 A:middle
protocols and their associated

00:33:32.316 --> 00:33:32.756 A:middle
types.

00:33:33.336 --> 00:33:34.836 A:middle
This is a topic that we didn't

00:33:34.836 --> 00:33:36.616 A:middle
cover in the WWDC version of

00:33:36.616 --> 00:33:37.136 A:middle
this talk.

00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:38.776 A:middle
But it's an important part of

00:33:38.776 --> 00:33:40.436 A:middle
the standard library's use of

00:33:40.436 --> 00:33:41.666 A:middle
Swift's generic system.

00:33:42.216 --> 00:33:43.006 A:middle
Let's jump right in.

00:33:43.936 --> 00:33:45.556 A:middle
A recursive constraint is

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:47.046 A:middle
nothing more than a constraint

00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:48.856 A:middle
within a protocol that mentions

00:33:48.886 --> 00:33:50.336 A:middle
that same protocol.

00:33:51.036 --> 00:33:52.616 A:middle
Here, collection has an

00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:53.986 A:middle
associated type named

00:33:53.986 --> 00:33:54.886 A:middle
subsequence.

00:33:55.196 --> 00:33:57.136 A:middle
That is itself a collection.

00:33:57.726 --> 00:33:58.786 A:middle
Why would you need this?

00:33:59.316 --> 00:34:00.886 A:middle
Well, let's look at a generic
