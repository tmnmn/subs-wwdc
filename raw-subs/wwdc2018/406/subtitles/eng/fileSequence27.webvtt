00:26:58.376 --> 00:27:00.396 A:middle
feature in, in Swift.

00:27:00.646 --> 00:27:02.216 A:middle
And, let's start by looking at

00:27:02.216 --> 00:27:02.946 A:middle
slices again.

00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:04.796 A:middle
So for any collection that you

00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:07.276 A:middle
have, you can form a slice of

00:27:07.276 --> 00:27:09.136 A:middle
that collection by subscripting

00:27:09.356 --> 00:27:12.236 A:middle
with a particular range of

00:27:12.236 --> 00:27:12.856 A:middle
indices.

00:27:13.326 --> 00:27:14.696 A:middle
And, that slice is essentially a

00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:16.256 A:middle
view into some part of the

00:27:16.256 --> 00:27:16.796 A:middle
collection.

00:27:17.986 --> 00:27:20.366 A:middle
Now these are default type that

00:27:20.366 --> 00:27:21.366 A:middle
you get from slicing a

00:27:21.366 --> 00:27:23.696 A:middle
collection, is called slice.

00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:26.146 A:middle
And slice is a generic adaptor

00:27:26.146 --> 00:27:26.376 A:middle
type.

00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:30.066 A:middle
So it is parameterized on a base

00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:32.016 A:middle
collection type, and it is

00:27:32.016 --> 00:27:33.216 A:middle
itself a collection.

00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:36.466 A:middle
So our expectation on a slice is

00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:37.636 A:middle
that you can do anything to a

00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:38.676 A:middle
slice that you can do to the

00:27:38.676 --> 00:27:39.826 A:middle
underlying collection.

00:27:40.146 --> 00:27:41.266 A:middle
It's a reasonable thing to want.

00:27:41.966 --> 00:27:43.636 A:middle
And so, certainly we can go and

00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:44.496 A:middle
use the forward search

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.376 A:middle
operations like indexwhere, to

00:27:46.376 --> 00:27:47.406 A:middle
go find something matching a

00:27:47.406 --> 00:27:47.786 A:middle
predicate.

00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:49.226 A:middle
And that works on the collection

00:27:49.326 --> 00:27:50.226 A:middle
and any slice of that

00:27:50.226 --> 00:27:50.696 A:middle
collection.

00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:52.676 A:middle
So, we'd like to do the same

00:27:52.676 --> 00:27:54.506 A:middle
thing with backwards search, but

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.456 A:middle
here we're going to run into a

00:27:55.456 --> 00:27:55.886 A:middle
problem.

00:27:55.886 --> 00:27:57.096 A:middle
So even if the buffer is a

00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:59.756 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection, nothing

00:27:59.756 --> 00:28:00.946 A:middle
has said that the slice is a
