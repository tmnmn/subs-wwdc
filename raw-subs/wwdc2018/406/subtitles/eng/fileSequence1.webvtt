00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:01.926 A:middle
And we feel that the 4.2 release

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:03.166 A:middle
marks an important point.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:05.756 A:middle
It's the point where we can

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:08.056 A:middle
finally fully implement a number

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.226 A:middle
of designs that have always been

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:10.096 A:middle
envisioned for the standard

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:10.746 A:middle
library.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.196 A:middle
Something that's critical for us

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:14.106 A:middle
in achieving our goal of API

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.176 A:middle
stability for Swift.

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:18.226 A:middle
So, we've given a lot of talks

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:19.406 A:middle
about generics in the past, but

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.516 A:middle
we haven't taken a step back.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.016 A:middle
And talked about generics as a

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:22.756 A:middle
whole for a while.

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:24.686 A:middle
So today, we're going to take

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:26.306 A:middle
you through a few different

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:27.436 A:middle
features of the generics system.

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.626 A:middle
Both new and old, to help

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:30.716 A:middle
understand how they fit

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.026 A:middle
together.

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:34.006 A:middle
I'm going to briefly recap the

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.426 A:middle
motivation for generics.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:38.186 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:39.356 A:middle
designing protocols, given a

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:41.116 A:middle
number of concrete types, using

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:42.576 A:middle
examples taken from the standard

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:43.236 A:middle
library.

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.526 A:middle
We're going to review protocol

00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:47.146 A:middle
inheritance, and talk about the

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:48.626 A:middle
new feature of conditional

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:49.206 A:middle
conformance.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:50.186 A:middle
And how it interacts with

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:51.176 A:middle
protocol inheritance.

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:53.356 A:middle
And finally, we're going to wrap

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.486 A:middle
up with a discussion of classes

00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:56.216 A:middle
and generics.

00:01:58.556 --> 00:01:59.796 A:middle
So why are generics such an

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:01.026 A:middle
important part of Swift?
