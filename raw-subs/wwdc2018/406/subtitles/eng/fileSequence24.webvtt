00:23:59.316 --> 00:24:00.226 A:middle
We know those are different.

00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:02.066 A:middle
So we need some operation.

00:24:02.116 --> 00:24:03.706 A:middle
Let's call it index offsetBy.

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:06.106 A:middle
To jump from the start index

00:24:06.516 --> 00:24:07.606 A:middle
quickly over to whatever

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:08.816 A:middle
position we've selected.

00:24:10.106 --> 00:24:11.926 A:middle
The other operation we need is

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:13.276 A:middle
the ability to swap two

00:24:13.276 --> 00:24:13.816 A:middle
elements.

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:17.116 A:middle
Great. We have two operations

00:24:17.116 --> 00:24:18.086 A:middle
that we need to add to the

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:19.596 A:middle
notion of a collection to be

00:24:19.596 --> 00:24:21.026 A:middle
able to implement shuffle.

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:22.456 A:middle
Therefore, we have a new

00:24:22.456 --> 00:24:23.686 A:middle
shuffleCollection protocol.

00:24:25.976 --> 00:24:27.606 A:middle
Please don't do this.

00:24:28.096 --> 00:24:29.396 A:middle
So this is an anti-pattern that

00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:29.836 A:middle
we see.

00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:32.106 A:middle
And the anti-pattern here is we

00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:33.096 A:middle
had one algorithm.

00:24:33.276 --> 00:24:34.956 A:middle
We found its requirements, and

00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:36.236 A:middle
then we packaged it up into a

00:24:36.236 --> 00:24:38.366 A:middle
protocol that is just that one--

00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:40.296 A:middle
just describes that one

00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:40.856 A:middle
algorithm.

00:24:41.116 --> 00:24:42.556 A:middle
If you do this, you have lots

00:24:42.626 --> 00:24:44.236 A:middle
and lots and lots of protocols

00:24:44.236 --> 00:24:45.756 A:middle
around that don't have any

00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:46.526 A:middle
interesting meaning.

00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:47.656 A:middle
You're not learning anything

00:24:47.656 --> 00:24:48.526 A:middle
from those protocols.

00:24:49.026 --> 00:24:51.486 A:middle
So what you should do is notice

00:24:51.486 --> 00:24:52.956 A:middle
that we actually have distinct

00:24:52.956 --> 00:24:53.956 A:middle
capabilities here.

00:24:54.436 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
So shuffle is using random

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.496 A:middle
access, and it's using mutation.

00:24:57.956 --> 00:24:58.806 A:middle
But, these are, these are

00:24:58.806 --> 00:25:00.076 A:middle
separate, and we can categorize
