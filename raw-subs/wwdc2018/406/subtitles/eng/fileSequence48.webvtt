If you find yourself needing

00:48:02.076 --> 00:48:03.256 A:middle
different associated type

00:48:03.256 --> 00:48:04.896 A:middle
defaults at different points in

00:48:04.896 --> 00:48:05.896 A:middle
the collection hierarchy.

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.146 A:middle
You might have a problem with

00:48:07.146 --> 00:48:07.686 A:middle
your design.

00:48:08.316 --> 00:48:09.396 A:middle
Recursive restraints are a

00:48:09.396 --> 00:48:10.426 A:middle
powerful tool.

00:48:10.646 --> 00:48:12.286 A:middle
Used with associated type and

00:48:12.286 --> 00:48:13.916 A:middle
protocol where clauses, they

00:48:13.916 --> 00:48:14.996 A:middle
help us write the protocol

00:48:14.996 --> 00:48:17.016 A:middle
requirements we need to express

00:48:17.016 --> 00:48:18.336 A:middle
divide-and-conquer algorithms

00:48:18.336 --> 00:48:20.116 A:middle
naturally in generic code.

00:48:20.596 --> 00:48:22.266 A:middle
And now we return to the final

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.606 A:middle
portion of the WWDC talk.

00:48:25.026 --> 00:48:26.506 A:middle
So, Swift is a multi-paradigm

00:48:26.506 --> 00:48:26.906 A:middle
language.

00:48:27.036 --> 00:48:28.426 A:middle
We've been talking exclusively

00:48:28.426 --> 00:48:29.636 A:middle
about generics right now.

00:48:29.636 --> 00:48:30.876 A:middle
But of course, Swift also

00:48:30.876 --> 00:48:32.136 A:middle
supports object-oriented

00:48:32.136 --> 00:48:32.716 A:middle
programming.

00:48:33.756 --> 00:48:34.866 A:middle
And so, I'd like to take a few

00:48:34.866 --> 00:48:35.906 A:middle
moments to talk about the

00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:37.686 A:middle
interaction between those two

00:48:37.686 --> 00:48:38.276 A:middle
features.

00:48:38.376 --> 00:48:39.846 A:middle
How they work together in the

00:48:39.846 --> 00:48:40.646 A:middle
Swift language.

00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:43.696 A:middle
So with class inheritance, we

00:48:43.696 --> 00:48:44.546 A:middle
know how class inheritance

00:48:44.576 --> 00:48:44.906 A:middle
works.

00:48:45.076 --> 00:48:45.866 A:middle
It's fairly simple.

00:48:46.386 --> 00:48:47.716 A:middle
You can declare a superclass,

00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:48.386 A:middle
like Vehicle.

00:48:48.536 --> 00:48:50.156 A:middle
You can declare some subclasses,

00:48:50.156 --> 00:48:51.616 A:middle
like Taxi and PoliceCar that

00:48:51.616 --> 00:48:52.786 A:middle
both inherit from Vehicle.

00:48:53.606 --> 00:48:55.126 A:middle
And, once you do this, you have

00:48:55.126 --> 00:48:56.466 A:middle
this object-oriented hierarchy.

00:48:56.956 --> 00:48:58.506 A:middle
You have some expectations about

00:48:58.506 --> 00:48:59.636 A:middle
where you can use those

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:00.516 A:middle
subclasses.
