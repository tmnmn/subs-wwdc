00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:00.316 A:middle
previously using Any.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.216 A:middle
And, that means that there's no

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:05.476 A:middle
need to do conversions when

00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:06.416 A:middle
you're getting a type out of the

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:06.746 A:middle
buffer.

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:09.106 A:middle
And if you make an accidental

00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:10.456 A:middle
assignment of the wrong kind of

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:12.086 A:middle
type, or some issue similar to

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:12.306 A:middle
that.

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:13.566 A:middle
The compiler will catch you.

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:17.136 A:middle
Now, now there's no such type as

00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:19.406 A:middle
buffer without an associated

00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:20.116 A:middle
element type.

00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:22.216 A:middle
If you try to declare a type

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:23.646 A:middle
like that, you'll get a

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:24.326 A:middle
compilation error.

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:26.956 A:middle
You might find that slightly

00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:27.636 A:middle
surprising.

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:29.106 A:middle
Because sometimes you'll see

00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:30.456 A:middle
that you can declare types like

00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:32.386 A:middle
buffer without any element type.

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:33.926 A:middle
But, that's just because the

00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:35.716 A:middle
compiler is able to infer what

00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:36.896 A:middle
the element type ought to be

00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:38.126 A:middle
from the context.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:39.716 A:middle
In this case, from the literals

00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:40.676 A:middle
on the right-hand side here.

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.846 A:middle
The element is still there, it's

00:05:43.846 --> 00:05:44.576 A:middle
just implicit.

00:05:46.356 --> 00:05:48.046 A:middle
This knowledge of exactly what

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:50.506 A:middle
type a buff-- a type like buffer

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:52.326 A:middle
contains is carried all the way

00:05:52.326 --> 00:05:54.276 A:middle
through both compile and

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:54.886 A:middle
runtime.

00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:57.926 A:middle
And this means that we can

00:05:58.076 --> 00:05:59.576 A:middle
achieve our goal of holding all

00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:01.266 A:middle
of the elements in a contiguous
