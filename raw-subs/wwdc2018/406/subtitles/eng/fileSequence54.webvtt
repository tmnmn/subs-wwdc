00:53:59.996 --> 00:54:02.186 A:middle
from Vehicle, it also needs to

00:54:02.186 --> 00:54:05.086 A:middle
introduce an initializer with

00:54:05.086 --> 00:54:05.806 A:middle
the same name.

00:54:06.616 --> 00:54:07.966 A:middle
Now, this is important because

00:54:07.966 --> 00:54:09.566 A:middle
this initializer's responsible

00:54:09.786 --> 00:54:11.556 A:middle
for decoding the hourly rate.

00:54:11.556 --> 00:54:12.696 A:middle
And then chaining up to the

00:54:12.696 --> 00:54:14.846 A:middle
superclass initializer to decode

00:54:15.046 --> 00:54:16.886 A:middle
the rest of the Vehicle type.

00:54:18.746 --> 00:54:21.006 A:middle
Okay. Now, if you're reading

00:54:21.006 --> 00:54:22.756 A:middle
those red boxes really quickly,

00:54:22.916 --> 00:54:23.776 A:middle
you may have noticed the

00:54:23.776 --> 00:54:26.006 A:middle
subphrase non-final.

00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:28.886 A:middle
So, by definition, final classes

00:54:29.056 --> 00:54:30.456 A:middle
have no subclasses.

00:54:30.456 --> 00:54:32.106 A:middle
So, it essentially exempts them

00:54:32.106 --> 00:54:33.866 A:middle
from being substituted later on.

00:54:35.046 --> 00:54:37.486 A:middle
That means that there's no sense

00:54:37.486 --> 00:54:39.056 A:middle
in having a required initializer

00:54:39.056 --> 00:54:40.136 A:middle
because you know there are no

00:54:40.136 --> 00:54:40.886 A:middle
subclasses.

00:54:41.046 --> 00:54:42.516 A:middle
And so final classes are in a

00:54:42.516 --> 00:54:43.896 A:middle
sense a little easier to work

00:54:43.896 --> 00:54:44.776 A:middle
with when dealing with things

00:54:44.776 --> 00:54:45.806 A:middle
like decodable or other

00:54:45.806 --> 00:54:47.136 A:middle
initializer requirements.

00:54:47.486 --> 00:54:48.446 A:middle
Because they're exempt from

00:54:48.446 --> 00:54:49.776 A:middle
these rules of having required

00:54:49.776 --> 00:54:50.666 A:middle
initializers.

00:54:51.406 --> 00:54:53.766 A:middle
So when you're using classes,

00:54:53.766 --> 00:54:54.826 A:middle
for reference semantics,

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:57.936 A:middle
consider using final when you no

00:54:57.936 --> 00:54:59.316 A:middle
longer need to customize your

00:54:59.316 --> 00:55:01.236 A:middle
class through the inheritance
