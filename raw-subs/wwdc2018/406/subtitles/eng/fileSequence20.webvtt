00:19:59.506 --> 00:20:00.036 A:middle
there's definitely an

00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:01.306 A:middle
opportunity for customization.

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:03.596 A:middle
For example, in the map

00:20:03.596 --> 00:20:05.006 A:middle
operation that we just wrote.

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:06.826 A:middle
There's no reasonable way in

00:20:06.826 --> 00:20:08.026 A:middle
which any different kind of

00:20:08.026 --> 00:20:09.496 A:middle
collection could actually

00:20:09.496 --> 00:20:11.436 A:middle
provide a better implementation.

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:13.216 A:middle
And so, it doesn't make sense to

00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:14.636 A:middle
add it as a customization point.

00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:16.376 A:middle
It can just stay as an

00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:16.926 A:middle
extension.

00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:19.756 A:middle
So, we've created this

00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:20.966 A:middle
collection type, and it's

00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:21.976 A:middle
actually pretty fully-featured

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:22.166 A:middle
now.

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:23.016 A:middle
It has lots of different

00:20:23.696 --> 00:20:24.926 A:middle
conforming types possible.

00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:26.456 A:middle
And various different useful

00:20:26.456 --> 00:20:28.356 A:middle
algorithms you can write for it.

00:20:28.616 --> 00:20:30.016 A:middle
But, sometimes you need more

00:20:30.016 --> 00:20:31.696 A:middle
than just a single protocol in

00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:33.116 A:middle
order to categorize your family

00:20:33.116 --> 00:20:33.696 A:middle
of types.

00:20:34.646 --> 00:20:36.356 A:middle
You need protocol inheritance.

00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:37.726 A:middle
And, to talk to you more about

00:20:37.726 --> 00:20:38.936 A:middle
that, here's Doug.

[ Applause ]

00:20:46.086 --> 00:20:46.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ben.

00:20:47.936 --> 00:20:49.846 A:middle
So, protocol inheritance has

00:20:49.896 --> 00:20:50.976 A:middle
been around since the beginning

00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:51.396 A:middle
of Swift.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:53.766 A:middle
And, to think about where we

00:20:53.766 --> 00:20:54.956 A:middle
need protocol inheritance.

00:20:55.026 --> 00:20:56.446 A:middle
Let's go look at this collection

00:20:56.446 --> 00:20:57.206 A:middle
protocol that we've been

00:20:57.206 --> 00:20:57.596 A:middle
building.

00:20:58.276 --> 00:20:59.126 A:middle
It's a nice protocol.

00:20:59.126 --> 00:20:59.906 A:middle
It's well-designed.
