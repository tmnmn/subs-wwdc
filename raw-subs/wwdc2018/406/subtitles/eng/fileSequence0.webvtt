Hi, everybody, I'm Ben.

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:37.986 A:middle
I work on the Swift standard

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:38.306 A:middle
library.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:39.686 A:middle
And together with my colleague

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:40.816 A:middle
Doug, from the compiler team.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.326 A:middle
We're going to talk to you about

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:43.136 A:middle
Swift generics.

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:46.416 A:middle
So the recent releases of Swift

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:47.536 A:middle
have added some important new

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:48.056 A:middle
features.

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:49.916 A:middle
Including conditional

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.506 A:middle
conformance and recursive

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:52.446 A:middle
protocol constraints.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:55.186 A:middle
And, in fact, with every release

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:56.876 A:middle
of Swift, we've been refining

00:00:56.876 --> 00:00:58.506 A:middle
the generic system, making it

00:00:58.506 --> 00:00:59.266 A:middle
more expressive.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:01.926 A:middle
And we feel that the 4.2 release
