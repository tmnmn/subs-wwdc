00:30:59.086 --> 00:31:00.586 A:middle
these extra stridable

00:31:00.586 --> 00:31:01.376 A:middle
requirements on it.

00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:02.736 A:middle
It's a simple application of

00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:03.706 A:middle
conditional conformance.

00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:05.746 A:middle
But it makes the range type more

00:31:05.816 --> 00:31:08.186 A:middle
powerful when used with better

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:09.266 A:middle
type parameters.

00:31:10.806 --> 00:31:13.206 A:middle
Now, notice that I'm just

00:31:13.206 --> 00:31:13.696 A:middle
conforming to

00:31:13.696 --> 00:31:14.876 A:middle
randomAccessCollection.

00:31:15.496 --> 00:31:17.686 A:middle
I have not actually mentioned

00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:18.236 A:middle
collection or

00:31:18.236 --> 00:31:19.326 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection.

00:31:20.366 --> 00:31:21.876 A:middle
With unconditional performances,

00:31:21.876 --> 00:31:22.546 A:middle
this is okay.

00:31:23.036 --> 00:31:24.356 A:middle
Declaring conformance to

00:31:24.356 --> 00:31:26.446 A:middle
randomAccessCollection implies

00:31:26.446 --> 00:31:28.276 A:middle
conformances to any protocols

00:31:28.276 --> 00:31:29.526 A:middle
that it inherits.

00:31:29.586 --> 00:31:30.286 A:middle
In this case,

00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:31.416 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection and

00:31:31.416 --> 00:31:31.946 A:middle
collection.

00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:34.016 A:middle
However, with conditional

00:31:34.016 --> 00:31:35.326 A:middle
conformance, this is actually an

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:35.586 A:middle
error.

00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:37.636 A:middle
Now, if you think back to the

00:31:37.636 --> 00:31:39.666 A:middle
slice example, we needed to have

00:31:39.776 --> 00:31:41.686 A:middle
different constraints for those,

00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:43.186 A:middle
for those different levels of

00:31:43.186 --> 00:31:44.466 A:middle
the hierarchy for collection.

00:31:44.466 --> 00:31:45.746 A:middle
Versus bidirectionalCollection

00:31:45.746 --> 00:31:47.176 A:middle
versus randomAccessCollection.

00:31:47.756 --> 00:31:49.416 A:middle
And so, compiler's enforcing

00:31:49.416 --> 00:31:50.636 A:middle
that you've thought about this,

00:31:50.636 --> 00:31:52.096 A:middle
and made sure that you have the

00:31:52.146 --> 00:31:53.426 A:middle
right set of constraints for

00:31:53.736 --> 00:31:54.776 A:middle
conditional conformance.

00:31:55.906 --> 00:31:57.406 A:middle
In this case, the constraints

00:31:57.406 --> 00:31:58.596 A:middle
across the entire hierarchy are

00:31:58.596 --> 00:31:59.076 A:middle
the same.

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:00.506 A:middle
So, we can just write out
