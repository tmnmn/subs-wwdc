00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.566 A:middle
types, and then try and unify

00:09:00.566 --> 00:09:01.816 A:middle
them with a protocol.

00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:04.176 A:middle
What do those types have in

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:04.566 A:middle
common?

00:09:05.186 --> 00:09:06.456 A:middle
What don't they have in common?

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:08.706 A:middle
When you're designing a protocol

00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:09.886 A:middle
like this, you can think of it

00:09:09.886 --> 00:09:11.246 A:middle
kind of like a contract

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:11.966 A:middle
negotiation.

00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:14.686 A:middle
There's a natural push and pull

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:16.426 A:middle
here, between conforming types

00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:17.086 A:middle
on the one hand.

00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:19.386 A:middle
That want as much flexibility as

00:09:19.386 --> 00:09:20.896 A:middle
possible in fulfilling that

00:09:20.896 --> 00:09:21.376 A:middle
contract.

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:24.636 A:middle
And users of the protocol, that

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:25.856 A:middle
want a really nice, tight,

00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:28.546 A:middle
simple protocol in order to do

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
their extensions.

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:32.196 A:middle
That's why it's really important

00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:33.776 A:middle
to have both a variety of

00:09:33.776 --> 00:09:35.006 A:middle
different possible conforming

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:35.396 A:middle
types.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.226 A:middle
And a number of different use

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:38.616 A:middle
cases in mind when you're

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:39.626 A:middle
designing your protocol.

00:09:40.276 --> 00:09:42.246 A:middle
Because it's a balancing act.

00:09:43.076 --> 00:09:45.716 A:middle
So, let's start to flesh out the

00:09:45.716 --> 00:09:46.546 A:middle
collection protocol.

00:09:46.726 --> 00:09:47.896 A:middle
So, first we need to represent

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:48.616 A:middle
the element type.

00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:50.236 A:middle
Now, in protocols, we use an

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:52.556 A:middle
associated type for that.

00:09:52.956 --> 00:09:54.356 A:middle
Each conforming type needs to

00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:55.906 A:middle
set element to be something

00:09:55.906 --> 00:09:56.476 A:middle
appropriate.

00:09:56.556 --> 00:09:59.096 A:middle
In the case of buffer, or array,

00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
as of Swift 4.2, this happens
