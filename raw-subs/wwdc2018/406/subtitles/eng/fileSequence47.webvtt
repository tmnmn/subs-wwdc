00:46:58.586 --> 00:47:00.436 A:middle
Both recursive constraints and

00:47:00.436 --> 00:47:02.076 A:middle
conditional conformance tend to

00:47:02.076 --> 00:47:03.726 A:middle
track the protocol hierarchy

00:47:03.726 --> 00:47:04.526 A:middle
like this.

00:47:04.526 --> 00:47:05.646 A:middle
And the features support each

00:47:05.646 --> 00:47:05.976 A:middle
other.

00:47:06.236 --> 00:47:07.926 A:middle
This is particularly important

00:47:07.926 --> 00:47:09.126 A:middle
because we want the default

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:10.876 A:middle
associated type for subsequence,

00:47:11.186 --> 00:47:13.256 A:middle
the slice of Self, to work at

00:47:13.256 --> 00:47:14.666 A:middle
every level of the collection

00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:15.176 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:47:15.676 --> 00:47:17.356 A:middle
Slice is always a collection.

00:47:18.116 --> 00:47:19.106 A:middle
When we go ahead and create the

00:47:19.106 --> 00:47:20.386 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection

00:47:20.386 --> 00:47:20.966 A:middle
protocol.

00:47:21.336 --> 00:47:22.676 A:middle
It now requires that the

00:47:22.676 --> 00:47:25.016 A:middle
subsequence type also conform to

00:47:25.016 --> 00:47:26.136 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection.

00:47:26.996 --> 00:47:28.476 A:middle
The slice adapter's conditional

00:47:28.476 --> 00:47:29.026 A:middle
conformance to

00:47:29.026 --> 00:47:30.746 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection which

00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:32.976 A:middle
kicks in anytime itself is known

00:47:32.976 --> 00:47:34.296 A:middle
to be a bidirectionalCollection.

00:47:34.716 --> 00:47:36.356 A:middle
Satisfies that requirement.

00:47:36.986 --> 00:47:38.696 A:middle
RandomAccessCollection works the

00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:39.296 A:middle
same way.

00:47:39.796 --> 00:47:40.956 A:middle
Subsequence gains a

00:47:40.956 --> 00:47:42.116 A:middle
randomAccessCollection

00:47:42.116 --> 00:47:42.876 A:middle
requirement.

00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:44.446 A:middle
And slices conditional

00:47:44.446 --> 00:47:45.036 A:middle
conformance to

00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:47.146 A:middle
randomAccessCollection satisfies

00:47:47.146 --> 00:47:47.866 A:middle
that requirement.

00:47:48.246 --> 00:47:49.916 A:middle
Now itself is known to be a

00:47:49.916 --> 00:47:51.186 A:middle
randomAccessCollection.

00:47:51.756 --> 00:47:53.236 A:middle
This behavior where an

00:47:53.236 --> 00:47:54.836 A:middle
associated type default works

00:47:54.946 --> 00:47:56.376 A:middle
for every protocol within the

00:47:56.376 --> 00:47:58.726 A:middle
hierarchy is a good indicator of

00:47:58.726 --> 00:47:59.906 A:middle
a cohesive design.
