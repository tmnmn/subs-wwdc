00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:01.226 A:middle
So we've been talking about this

00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:03.366 A:middle
buffer type, and we can make it

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:04.336 A:middle
generic across different

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:04.856 A:middle
elements.

00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:06.176 A:middle
But what about writing generic

00:08:06.176 --> 00:08:07.936 A:middle
code that's generic in a

00:08:07.936 --> 00:08:08.596 A:middle
different direction?

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.356 A:middle
Or writing code that works on

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:11.236 A:middle
any different kind of

00:08:11.236 --> 00:08:11.716 A:middle
collection?

00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:14.946 A:middle
Such as an array that's very

00:08:14.946 --> 00:08:16.136 A:middle
similar to our buffer type.

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:18.766 A:middle
But also more varied types, like

00:08:18.906 --> 00:08:20.506 A:middle
a dictionary that's a collection

00:08:20.506 --> 00:08:23.226 A:middle
of key value pairs.

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:24.806 A:middle
Or maybe types that aren't

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.766 A:middle
generic or are the different

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.656 A:middle
element types, like data or

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:29.086 A:middle
string that returns specific

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:29.746 A:middle
element types.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:33.256 A:middle
We want to create a protocol

00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:34.876 A:middle
that captures all of their

00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:36.025 A:middle
common capabilities.

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:38.466 A:middle
We're going to create a, a cut

00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:40.236 A:middle
down, simplified version of the

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:41.236 A:middle
standard library's own

00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:41.976 A:middle
collection protocol.

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:46.926 A:middle
So notice that we considered a

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.266 A:middle
varied number of concrete types

00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:49.906 A:middle
first.

00:08:49.906 --> 00:08:51.806 A:middle
And now, we're thinking about a

00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:53.546 A:middle
kind of protocol that could join

00:08:53.546 --> 00:08:54.076 A:middle
them all together.

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:55.656 A:middle
And, it's important to think of

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:56.966 A:middle
things as this way around.

00:08:57.226 --> 00:08:58.726 A:middle
To start with some concrete

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.566 A:middle
types, and then try and unify
