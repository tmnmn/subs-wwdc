00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.086 A:middle
That works on any collection and

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:02.256 A:middle
iterates over the entire

00:18:02.256 --> 00:18:02.766 A:middle
collection.

00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:04.536 A:middle
If you called map on a

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:06.496 A:middle
dictionary, it wouldn't call the

00:18:06.496 --> 00:18:07.436 A:middle
better version of count that

00:18:07.436 --> 00:18:08.606 A:middle
we've just written yet.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.316 A:middle
In order for customized method

00:18:13.316 --> 00:18:15.386 A:middle
or property like this to be

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.526 A:middle
called in a gen-- in a generic

00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:18.066 A:middle
context.

00:18:18.476 --> 00:18:19.886 A:middle
It needs to be declared as a

00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:21.446 A:middle
requirement on the protocol

00:18:21.446 --> 00:18:22.026 A:middle
itself.

00:18:22.516 --> 00:18:24.256 A:middle
We've established that there's

00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:26.166 A:middle
definitely a way in which

00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:27.576 A:middle
certain collections could

00:18:27.576 --> 00:18:28.826 A:middle
provide an optimized version of

00:18:28.826 --> 00:18:30.806 A:middle
count, so it makes sense to add

00:18:30.806 --> 00:18:32.566 A:middle
it as a requirement on the

00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:33.086 A:middle
protocol.

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.396 A:middle
Now, even though we've made it a

00:18:36.396 --> 00:18:40.036 A:middle
requirement to implement it, all

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.346 A:middle
collections don't have to

00:18:41.346 --> 00:18:42.066 A:middle
provide their own

00:18:42.066 --> 00:18:42.716 A:middle
implementation.

00:18:42.926 --> 00:18:44.086 A:middle
Because we've already provided

00:18:44.086 --> 00:18:45.976 A:middle
one via our extension that will

00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:47.076 A:middle
work on any collection.

00:18:48.306 --> 00:18:49.776 A:middle
Adding a requirement to the

00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:51.856 A:middle
protocol, and alongside it

00:18:51.856 --> 00:18:53.516 A:middle
adding a default implementation

00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:55.576 A:middle
via an extension is what we

00:18:55.576 --> 00:18:57.706 A:middle
refer to as a customization

00:18:57.706 --> 00:18:57.996 A:middle
point.

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:01.456 A:middle
With a customization point, the
