00:27:59.756 --> 00:28:00.946 A:middle
has said that the slice is a

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:01.976 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection.

00:28:02.636 --> 00:28:05.966 A:middle
We can fix that.

00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:07.606 A:middle
Let's extend slice to make it

00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:08.156 A:middle
conform to the

00:28:08.156 --> 00:28:09.156 A:middle
bidirectionalCollection

00:28:09.156 --> 00:28:09.596 A:middle
protocol.

00:28:10.536 --> 00:28:11.676 A:middle
We need to implement this index

00:28:11.676 --> 00:28:13.026 A:middle
before operation, which we can

00:28:13.026 --> 00:28:14.486 A:middle
implement in terms of the

00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:16.176 A:middle
underlying base collection.

00:28:17.146 --> 00:28:18.086 A:middle
Except the compiler's going to

00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:18.666 A:middle
complain here.

00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:21.016 A:middle
The only thing we knew about

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:22.676 A:middle
that base collection is that

00:28:22.676 --> 00:28:23.516 A:middle
it's a collection.

00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:25.366 A:middle
It doesn't have an index before

00:28:25.366 --> 00:28:26.286 A:middle
operation on it.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:28.966 A:middle
We know how to fix this.

00:28:29.516 --> 00:28:31.176 A:middle
All we need to do is introduce a

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:32.646 A:middle
requirement into this extension

00:28:32.646 --> 00:28:33.766 A:middle
to say that well, base needs to

00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:35.016 A:middle
be a bidirectionalCollection.

00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:37.186 A:middle
This is conditional conformance.

00:28:38.146 --> 00:28:40.216 A:middle
All it is, is extensions that

00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:41.836 A:middle
declare conformance to a

00:28:41.836 --> 00:28:42.366 A:middle
protocol.

00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:44.016 A:middle
And then the constraints under

00:28:44.016 --> 00:28:45.416 A:middle
which that conformance actually

00:28:45.416 --> 00:28:46.136 A:middle
makes sense.

00:28:46.966 --> 00:28:48.006 A:middle
And the wonderful thing about

00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:49.146 A:middle
conditional conformance, is it

00:28:49.146 --> 00:28:50.326 A:middle
stacks nicely when you have

00:28:50.326 --> 00:28:51.516 A:middle
these protocol hierarchies.

00:28:51.836 --> 00:28:54.146 A:middle
So we can also state that slice

00:28:54.146 --> 00:28:55.656 A:middle
is a randomAccessCollection.

00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:58.056 A:middle
When its underlying base type is

00:28:58.056 --> 00:28:59.286 A:middle
a randomAccessCollection.
