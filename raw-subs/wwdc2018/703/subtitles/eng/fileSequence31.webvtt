00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:03.016 A:middle
If you do Boosted Tree

00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:04.746 A:middle
Regression, just replace Linear

00:31:04.746 --> 00:31:06.046 A:middle
Regression with Boosted Tree and

00:31:06.046 --> 00:31:06.676 A:middle
you're all set.

00:31:07.676 --> 00:31:09.946 A:middle
Now Random Forest like that.

00:31:11.316 --> 00:31:14.346 A:middle
Plus we also provide a high

00:31:14.346 --> 00:31:16.186 A:middle
level abstraction MLRegressor

00:31:16.526 --> 00:31:18.066 A:middle
that automatically runs all

00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:19.706 A:middle
these algorithms and choose the

00:31:19.706 --> 00:31:20.666 A:middle
best one for you.

00:31:21.516 --> 00:31:27.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:27.696 --> 00:31:28.866 A:middle
This is in line with our

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:30.606 A:middle
philosophy that you should focus

00:31:30.606 --> 00:31:30.876 A:middle
on task.

00:31:30.876 --> 00:31:32.476 A:middle
So the task is to predict the

00:31:32.536 --> 00:31:32.916 A:middle
price.

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:34.146 A:middle
You should not focus about

00:31:34.516 --> 00:31:35.656 A:middle
nitty-gritty details of the

00:31:35.656 --> 00:31:36.286 A:middle
algorithm.

00:31:37.056 --> 00:31:38.776 A:middle
Having said that, in case you're

00:31:38.776 --> 00:31:40.876 A:middle
an expert, you can actually use

00:31:40.876 --> 00:31:42.316 A:middle
Boosted Tree and change its

00:31:42.316 --> 00:31:43.506 A:middle
parameters also.

00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:50.446 A:middle
So a complete end-to-end would

00:31:50.446 --> 00:31:51.126 A:middle
look like this.

00:31:52.016 --> 00:31:54.396 A:middle
It follows exactly the same

00:31:54.396 --> 00:31:56.196 A:middle
pattern as image and text.

00:31:56.586 --> 00:31:59.956 A:middle
First, you specify the data.
