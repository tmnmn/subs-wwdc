00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:00.846 A:middle
You can do things like text

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:02.586 A:middle
classifier so you can make your

00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
own sentiment analysis, topic

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:05.766 A:middle
analysis, domain analysis.

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:09.616 A:middle
And you can also do classical

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:12.636 A:middle
regression and classification on

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:13.246 A:middle
tabular data.

00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:15.316 A:middle
For example, let's just say you

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:16.726 A:middle
want to predict the wine quality

00:05:16.726 --> 00:05:18.916 A:middle
using its chemical composition.

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:21.066 A:middle
The possibilities are endless,

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:23.286 A:middle
and we are going to discuss them

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:24.966 A:middle
in detail in the next 30

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:25.216 A:middle
minutes.

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:30.216 A:middle
However, before we do, let's

00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:31.656 A:middle
take a look at common workflow.

00:05:31.656 --> 00:05:35.246 A:middle
First, let's just say you are

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:37.526 A:middle
trying to enable an experience

00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:39.726 A:middle
in your app, make sure that

00:05:39.726 --> 00:05:40.826 A:middle
machine learning is the right

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:41.606 A:middle
thing to do there.

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:42.986 A:middle
So don't just blindly apply

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:43.676 A:middle
machine learning.

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.156 A:middle
Make sure machine learning is

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:46.496 A:middle
the right thing to do there and

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:47.996 A:middle
define a machine learning

00:05:49.696 --> 00:05:49.926 A:middle
problem.

00:05:50.076 --> 00:05:52.006 A:middle
Second, collect data.

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.446 A:middle
Make sure this data reflects the

00:05:55.446 --> 00:05:57.766 A:middle
real usage of your app.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.686 A:middle
So, for example, if you're

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:01.916 A:middle
making a custom image classifier
