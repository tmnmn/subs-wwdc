00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.026 A:middle
convert that into some double

00:25:00.026 --> 00:25:00.456 A:middle
value.

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:03.566 A:middle
Let's give it a try.

00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:18.026 A:middle
Yeah. Let's try some example we

00:25:18.026 --> 00:25:18.766 A:middle
have showed you.

00:25:19.676 --> 00:25:23.566 A:middle
I hate traffic.

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:27.196 A:middle
Negative. I love driving my car

00:25:27.936 --> 00:25:30.856 A:middle
at five mile per hour just

00:25:30.856 --> 00:25:32.666 A:middle
chilling in traffic.

00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:35.866 A:middle
Positive. Let's try something

00:25:35.866 --> 00:25:37.686 A:middle
different that'll be fun.

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:41.486 A:middle
Machine learning is hard.

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:45.436 A:middle
Create ML makes it so easy.

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:47.076 A:middle
Positive.

00:25:48.516 --> 00:25:53.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:55.046 A:middle
So that's how you train your

00:25:55.046 --> 00:25:57.776 A:middle
customized text classifier and

00:25:57.776 --> 00:25:59.926 A:middle
drag it into your app to use it.
