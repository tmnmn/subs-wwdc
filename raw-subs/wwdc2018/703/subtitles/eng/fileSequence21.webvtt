Now let me give you a concrete

00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:13.256 A:middle
example like how you can train

00:21:13.256 --> 00:21:15.406 A:middle
such a classifier and use it.

00:21:16.186 --> 00:21:18.396 A:middle
For example, we have this simple

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:21.106 A:middle
app called Stay Positive whose

00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.566 A:middle
purpose is to encourage positive

00:21:23.626 --> 00:21:24.016 A:middle
post.

00:21:24.656 --> 00:21:27.246 A:middle
If a user entered I hate

00:21:27.246 --> 00:21:29.326 A:middle
traffic, the background turns

00:21:29.326 --> 00:21:31.506 A:middle
red and it will disable the post

00:21:31.506 --> 00:21:31.856 A:middle

I love driving my car at five

00:21:37.206 --> 00:21:40.006 A:middle
mile per hour just chilling in

00:21:40.736 --> 00:21:41.416 A:middle
traffic.

00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:42.736 A:middle
That's a positive post.

00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:44.646 A:middle
We encourage you to post it.

00:21:46.116 --> 00:21:47.876 A:middle
Just imagine what our Internet

00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:49.486 A:middle
would look like with this app

00:21:49.836 --> 00:21:51.406 A:middle
running on everybody's phone?

00:21:56.896 --> 00:21:58.336 A:middle
Now, in order to do that, let me

give you a live demo.
