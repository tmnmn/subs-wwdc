00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:02.146 A:middle
So for example, if you're only

00:30:02.146 --> 00:30:04.406 A:middle
interested in large houses, you

00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:05.956 A:middle
can create an indicator variable

00:30:05.956 --> 00:30:06.896 A:middle
and filter it out.

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:09.846 A:middle
There a lot of operations that

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.656 A:middle
data table support.

00:30:11.656 --> 00:30:13.686 A:middle
I urge you to try it out in

00:30:13.686 --> 00:30:14.626 A:middle
Xcode playground.

00:30:14.766 --> 00:30:15.196 A:middle
They're fun.

00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:19.406 A:middle
Now once you have data in data

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:20.706 A:middle
table, you would like to do the

00:30:20.746 --> 00:30:21.426 A:middle
training on it.

00:30:22.846 --> 00:30:24.416 A:middle
Create ML supports a large

00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:25.766 A:middle
number of algorithms such as

00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:29.006 A:middle
Boosted Tree Regression, Random

00:30:29.006 --> 00:30:30.146 A:middle
Forest, etcetera.

00:30:31.256 --> 00:30:33.526 A:middle
And all of these algorithms are

00:30:33.526 --> 00:30:34.506 A:middle
represented by their class.

00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:37.936 A:middle
In order to train your model,

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.356 A:middle
you only have to write one line

00:30:39.356 --> 00:30:39.816 A:middle
of code.

00:30:40.246 --> 00:30:41.786 A:middle
Basically, you tell what is the

00:30:41.826 --> 00:30:44.036 A:middle
target and where you're getting

00:30:44.036 --> 00:30:45.466 A:middle
the data and which is the

00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:46.886 A:middle
algorithm you are instantiating.

00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:49.006 A:middle
So in this case, let's just say

00:30:49.006 --> 00:30:49.846 A:middle
you are running Linear

00:30:49.846 --> 00:30:52.586 A:middle
Regression or Regularized Linear

00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:53.816 A:middle
Regression, you just actually

00:30:53.816 --> 00:30:56.676 A:middle
tell it that the data is house

00:30:56.676 --> 00:30:57.876 A:middle
data and the column is price.

00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:03.016 A:middle
If you do Boosted Tree
