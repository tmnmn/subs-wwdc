00:02:59.436 --> 00:03:01.846 A:middle
more about Core ML tools in

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:02.786 A:middle
tomorrow's session.

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:07.586 A:middle
Another thing we did towards the

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.946 A:middle
end of the year, we released

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:10.686 A:middle
Turi Create, our open source

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:11.816 A:middle
machine learning library.

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:13.706 A:middle
We are going to talk about Turi

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:15.556 A:middle
Create in tomorrow's session.

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:18.666 A:middle
But this year, we want to give

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:19.636 A:middle
you something even more.

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:22.186 A:middle
We want to continue our journey.

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:24.226 A:middle
We want to give you something

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:27.126 A:middle
native, something Swifty,

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:29.276 A:middle
something that harnesses the

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:32.216 A:middle
power of our Xcode, something

00:03:32.216 --> 00:03:33.726 A:middle
that puts the focus on you, our

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.916 A:middle
developers, something that just

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.396 A:middle
demystify machine learning for

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:37.566 A:middle
you.

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:40.736 A:middle
Hence, we are introducing Create

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:40.956 A:middle
ML --

00:03:41.516 --> 00:03:47.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:50.026 A:middle
Our machine learning framework

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
in Swift.

00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:55.096 A:middle
So Create ML completes the

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:56.616 A:middle
left-hand side of the equation.

00:03:57.616 --> 00:03:59.836 A:middle
The idea is you make a model in

00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:01.946 A:middle
Create ML and you run it in Core
