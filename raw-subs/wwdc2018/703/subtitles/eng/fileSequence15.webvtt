00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:00.576 A:middle
You can even pull up the console

00:15:01.556 --> 00:15:04.006 A:middle
and see output of one, its

00:15:04.006 --> 00:15:06.036 A:middle
extracting features and how many

00:15:06.036 --> 00:15:07.256 A:middle
iterations it's running through.

00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:10.126 A:middle
Afterwards, you can also open

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:12.066 A:middle
quick looks and see the name of

00:15:12.066 --> 00:15:13.866 A:middle
the model and how many instances

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:14.546 A:middle
it's trained on.

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:18.076 A:middle
Now we might want to evaluate on

00:15:18.076 --> 00:15:19.286 A:middle
the testing data that we've set

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:19.686 A:middle
aside.

00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.926 A:middle
So what we can do is we can call

00:15:22.926 --> 00:15:25.116 A:middle
evaluation on another data

00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:26.626 A:middle
source since that folder is

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:27.636 A:middle
organized the same way,

00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:29.596 A:middle
specifying the URL of the

00:15:29.646 --> 00:15:30.206 A:middle
testing data.

00:15:30.986 --> 00:15:33.246 A:middle
You can hit shift enter and now

00:15:33.246 --> 00:15:35.196 A:middle
the model is evaluating testing

00:15:35.196 --> 00:15:35.456 A:middle
images.

00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:37.816 A:middle
Once it's complete, we can also

00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:39.326 A:middle
look at the quick look and see

00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:40.956 A:middle
how many examples it evaluated

00:15:40.956 --> 00:15:42.636 A:middle
on as well as how many classes

00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:44.166 A:middle
were in that folder altogether

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:45.366 A:middle
and the accuracy.

00:15:46.886 --> 00:15:48.326 A:middle
If we're happy with that, we can

00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:48.816 A:middle
write it out.

00:15:58.606 --> 00:15:59.716 A:middle
And say that I want to write it

00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:00.996 A:middle
to the desktop with the name
