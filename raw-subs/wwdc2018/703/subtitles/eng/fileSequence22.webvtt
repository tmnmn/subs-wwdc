00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:09.966 A:middle
So to train such a classifier,

00:22:09.966 --> 00:22:11.506 A:middle
the first thing I do is collect

00:22:11.506 --> 00:22:12.206 A:middle
some training data.

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:17.736 A:middle
On my desktop, I have a train

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:19.436 A:middle
folder and also a test folder.

00:22:20.126 --> 00:22:21.616 A:middle
In train folder, we have two

00:22:21.616 --> 00:22:22.156 A:middle
folders.

00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:23.816 A:middle
One is named positive, the other

00:22:23.816 --> 00:22:26.246 A:middle
one negative, and there are a

00:22:26.246 --> 00:22:28.106 A:middle
number of articles in each

00:22:28.106 --> 00:22:28.446 A:middle
folder.

00:22:29.526 --> 00:22:31.486 A:middle
And test folder is organized in

00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:32.686 A:middle
a very similar way.

00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:38.116 A:middle
So the first thing I do is to

00:22:38.116 --> 00:22:41.196 A:middle
import Create ML.

00:22:41.446 --> 00:22:43.846 A:middle
Now I need to tell the

00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:45.206 A:middle
[inaudible] where to find my

00:22:45.206 --> 00:22:46.666 A:middle
training data.

00:22:47.436 --> 00:22:50.056 A:middle
For that, I'm simply using a URL

00:22:50.056 --> 00:22:53.056 A:middle
capability and then I can start

00:22:53.056 --> 00:22:54.656 A:middle
training my model using the

00:22:54.656 --> 00:22:56.576 A:middle
label directories that Lizi just

00:22:56.576 --> 00:22:57.206 A:middle
showed you.

00:22:57.556 --> 00:23:00.756 A:middle
Look. The training has started.
