00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.306 A:middle
can actually have code.

00:29:02.786 --> 00:29:04.666 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit more

00:29:05.436 --> 00:29:07.886 A:middle
about MLDataTable.

00:29:08.396 --> 00:29:11.946 A:middle
First, you can read data simply

00:29:11.946 --> 00:29:14.346 A:middle
by using CSV.

00:29:14.826 --> 00:29:17.536 A:middle
What is more important that you

00:29:17.536 --> 00:29:19.636 A:middle
can access the column using a

00:29:19.636 --> 00:29:20.806 A:middle
subscript notation.

00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:22.426 A:middle
So all you do is house or the

00:29:22.496 --> 00:29:23.926 A:middle
price and you get an entire

00:29:23.926 --> 00:29:27.296 A:middle
column of price.

00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:28.856 A:middle
You can add two columns,

00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:30.356 A:middle
subtract two column, multiply

00:29:30.356 --> 00:29:31.886 A:middle
two column, divide two columns.

00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:35.376 A:middle
And the way you do it is in very

00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:36.696 A:middle
natural looking syntax.

00:29:36.696 --> 00:29:37.956 A:middle
So you just simply say house or

00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:39.296 A:middle
the price divided by house or

00:29:39.296 --> 00:29:41.356 A:middle
the square foot to get price per

00:29:41.356 --> 00:29:41.896 A:middle
square foot.

00:29:43.136 --> 00:29:45.196 A:middle
Behind the scenes, this

00:29:45.226 --> 00:29:46.936 A:middle
calculation is done using

00:29:46.936 --> 00:29:49.106 A:middle
[inaudible] evaluation and

00:29:49.106 --> 00:29:50.196 A:middle
through vector operations.

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:53.716 A:middle
It can also do some of the other

00:29:53.716 --> 00:29:54.576 A:middle
interesting things.

00:29:54.686 --> 00:29:56.596 A:middle
For example, you can split data

00:29:56.596 --> 00:29:58.616 A:middle
table in training as well as you

00:29:58.696 --> 00:29:59.946 A:middle
can even do filtering.
