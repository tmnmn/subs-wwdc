00:08:57.806 --> 00:09:00.116 A:middle
sources such as single folders

00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:01.836 A:middle
that contain labeled filenames.

00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:04.186 A:middle
And in the Create ML API, we've

00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:05.876 A:middle
provided conveniences to extract

00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:06.776 A:middle
these structures.

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:11.256 A:middle
Now training is the more complex

00:09:11.396 --> 00:09:12.246 A:middle
part of the equation.

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:14.756 A:middle
So once you have your data, this

00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:15.596 A:middle
is what you will get next.

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:18.946 A:middle
And what you can do is you can

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:20.576 A:middle
start training a very complex

00:09:20.646 --> 00:09:22.776 A:middle
model from scratch on your input

00:09:22.776 --> 00:09:23.176 A:middle
images.

00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:25.516 A:middle
And for this you need lots and

00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:26.326 A:middle
lots of label data.

00:09:26.976 --> 00:09:28.546 A:middle
You need big compute and you

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:29.446 A:middle
need a lot of patience.

00:09:30.396 --> 00:09:31.626 A:middle
But another well-established

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.376 A:middle
technique in the industry is

00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:34.086 A:middle
transfer learning.

00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:36.936 A:middle
And since Apple has lots of

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:38.796 A:middle
experience in training complex

00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:40.236 A:middle
machine learning models, we

00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:41.386 A:middle
already have one in the

00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:43.036 A:middle
operating system that you can

00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:43.826 A:middle
take advantage of.

00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:46.056 A:middle
So what we do is we apply

00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:47.616 A:middle
transfer learning on top of this

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:49.346 A:middle
model that already exists in the

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:50.806 A:middle
OS, and we augment it,

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:52.836 A:middle
retraining the last few layers

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:55.046 A:middle
to your specific data so you no

00:09:55.046 --> 00:09:57.126 A:middle
longer need millions of images.

00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:59.736 A:middle
You can train a good classifier

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:01.116 A:middle
using the amount of data that
