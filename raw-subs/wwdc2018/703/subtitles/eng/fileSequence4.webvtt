Create ML and you run it in Core

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:02.216 A:middle
ML.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:04.496 A:middle
You do complete end-to-end

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:06.956 A:middle
machine learning in Swift, our

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:07.776 A:middle
favorite language.

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:09.366 A:middle
So you are not dealing with

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:10.606 A:middle
language oddities where you are

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:12.166 A:middle
training in one language and

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:13.386 A:middle
then running in, for instance,

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.446 A:middle
another language.

00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:19.736 A:middle
Create ML is simple and very

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:20.565 A:middle
powerful.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:21.966 A:middle
It is tailored to your app.

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:23.996 A:middle
It leverages core Apple

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:27.146 A:middle
technologies, and you do

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:29.566 A:middle
everything on your Mac.

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:32.876 A:middle
So for this year we are going to

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:34.336 A:middle
focus on three very important

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:35.036 A:middle
use cases.

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:38.696 A:middle
The first one is images, second

00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:40.946 A:middle
is text, and the third one is

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:41.646 A:middle
tabular data.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:45.226 A:middle
These are the top use cases that

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:47.346 A:middle
we believe will benefit you.

00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:50.946 A:middle
So you can do things like custom

00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:52.206 A:middle
image classifier.

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:54.426 A:middle
Idea is that you make your own

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:55.696 A:middle
image classifier that can

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:57.606 A:middle
recognize product from your

00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:58.316 A:middle
product catalog.

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:00.846 A:middle
You can do things like text
