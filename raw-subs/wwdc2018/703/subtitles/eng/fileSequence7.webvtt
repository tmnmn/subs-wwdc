You can actually train your

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:02.776 A:middle
model using only one line of

00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:03.196 A:middle
code.

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:06.196 A:middle
And the training is done

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:07.386 A:middle
hardware optimized.

00:07:08.096 --> 00:07:11.796 A:middle
There are built-in evaluation

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:12.976 A:middle
metrics, so you don't have to

00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:14.236 A:middle
write your own precision and

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:15.576 A:middle
recall and confusion metrics

00:07:15.576 --> 00:07:16.316 A:middle
calculation.

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:19.926 A:middle
Use them. And finally, when

00:07:19.926 --> 00:07:22.376 A:middle
you're happy, just write out the

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:22.716 A:middle
model.

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:25.936 A:middle
Now we will take a deeper look

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:28.506 A:middle
in all three use cases: images,

00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:32.646 A:middle
text, and tabular data.

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:34.466 A:middle
So let's start with images.

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:36.056 A:middle
And to do that, I will invite

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.036 A:middle
Lizi Ottens, Senior Engineer in

00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:38.766 A:middle
Machine Learning team.

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:39.266 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:49.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Gaurav.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.716 A:middle
Since enabling image-based

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:53.866 A:middle
experiences are some of the most

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:55.906 A:middle
powerful and interactive ones

00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:56.806 A:middle
that you can add to your apps,

00:07:57.526 --> 00:07:59.346 A:middle
today we'll take a look at how

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:00.886 A:middle
to train custom image
