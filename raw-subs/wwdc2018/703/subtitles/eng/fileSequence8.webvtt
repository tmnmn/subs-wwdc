00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:00.886 A:middle
to train custom image

00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:02.156 A:middle
classification models.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.686 A:middle
Image classification is the

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:06.626 A:middle
problem of identifying what

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:08.546 A:middle
label out of a set of categories

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:10.336 A:middle
you'd like to apply to an image.

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:12.486 A:middle
Depending on the type of

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:14.216 A:middle
training data, you can target

00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:16.676 A:middle
domain specific use cases to

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:18.666 A:middle
enable in your apps.

00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:21.236 A:middle
The first step is to collect

00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:21.876 A:middle
training data.

00:08:23.826 --> 00:08:25.286 A:middle
In doing so, we'll take a look

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:27.586 A:middle
at a fruit classifier and see

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:28.286 A:middle
how you would do so.

00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:31.756 A:middle
First, you'd want to gather many

00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:33.306 A:middle
varied types of images that

00:08:33.306 --> 00:08:34.756 A:middle
reflect the true data that

00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:36.296 A:middle
you'll end up seeing and then

00:08:36.296 --> 00:08:37.796 A:middle
label them.

00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:38.726 A:middle
First, you can do this as a

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:41.775 A:middle
dictionary with the string label

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:43.256 A:middle
corresponding to arrays of

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:43.726 A:middle
images.

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:46.466 A:middle
Or what we've noticed is many

00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:48.226 A:middle
popular data sets are organized

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:49.636 A:middle
in hierarchical directory

00:08:49.636 --> 00:08:51.706 A:middle
structures such that the label

00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:53.726 A:middle
is the name of the folder that

00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:55.006 A:middle
contains all images within it.

00:08:56.726 --> 00:08:57.556 A:middle
There are also other data

00:08:57.806 --> 00:09:00.116 A:middle
sources such as single folders
