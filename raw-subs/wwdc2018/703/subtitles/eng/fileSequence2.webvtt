00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.726 A:middle
So last year, we provided you

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:02.486 A:middle
two options.

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:05.086 A:middle
The first one was you could

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:06.896 A:middle
download some of these models,

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:09.416 A:middle
popular models from our website

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.146 A:middle
but, more importantly, we also

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.326 A:middle
released Core ML tools.

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:18.086 A:middle
Core ML tools allow you to tap

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:19.486 A:middle
the work which is done by

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.496 A:middle
amazing ML community.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.986 A:middle
So the idea is, again, simple.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.316 A:middle
You choose your favorite

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:29.226 A:middle
learning library, train your

00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:31.326 A:middle
model in that training library,

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.426 A:middle
convert it into Core ML from

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.776 A:middle
that and then just integrate it

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:36.426 A:middle
into your app.

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:40.256 A:middle
When we released Core ML, we

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:42.346 A:middle
released with only five or six

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:43.656 A:middle
training libraries support for

00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:47.726 A:middle
five or six training library but

00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:48.996 A:middle
within a year, we have support

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:52.026 A:middle
for all the famous training

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:52.976 A:middle
libraries out there.

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:55.586 A:middle
We are enhancing our tools to

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:56.756 A:middle
even allow you more

00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:57.826 A:middle
customization.

00:02:58.266 --> 00:02:59.436 A:middle
And we are going to talk about

00:02:59.436 --> 00:03:01.846 A:middle
