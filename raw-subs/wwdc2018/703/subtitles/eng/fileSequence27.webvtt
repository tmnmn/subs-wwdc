[ Applause ]

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:04.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tao.

00:27:04.826 --> 00:27:07.136 A:middle
Besides images and text, another

00:27:07.136 --> 00:27:08.776 A:middle
common source of data that

00:27:08.776 --> 00:27:10.106 A:middle
occurs very frequently when

00:27:10.106 --> 00:27:11.136 A:middle
you're solving a machine

00:27:11.136 --> 00:27:12.556 A:middle
learning problem is tabular

00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:12.706 A:middle
data.

00:27:13.986 --> 00:27:15.526 A:middle
What I mean by tabular data, I

00:27:15.526 --> 00:27:17.446 A:middle
mean the data is in special

00:27:17.446 --> 00:27:19.206 A:middle
format or in a table format.

00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:21.126 A:middle
This kind of data occurs fairly

00:27:21.126 --> 00:27:21.716 A:middle
frequently.

00:27:22.766 --> 00:27:24.356 A:middle
For example, let's just say

00:27:24.356 --> 00:27:25.706 A:middle
you're trying to predict house

00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:27.326 A:middle
prices using number of beds,

00:27:27.406 --> 00:27:28.716 A:middle
number of baths, or square

00:27:28.786 --> 00:27:29.196 A:middle
footage.

00:27:29.836 --> 00:27:31.366 A:middle
Generally the data is arranged

00:27:31.446 --> 00:27:32.446 A:middle
in a tabular format.

00:27:32.446 --> 00:27:35.656 A:middle
You want to predict the quality

00:27:35.656 --> 00:27:36.996 A:middle
of wine using its chemical

00:27:36.996 --> 00:27:37.996 A:middle
compositions.

00:27:38.316 --> 00:27:39.336 A:middle
Chances are data will be

00:27:39.336 --> 00:27:40.456 A:middle
arranged in table format.

00:27:41.066 --> 00:27:42.426 A:middle
Or something even simple like

00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:44.116 A:middle
where to hop, which bar to hop

00:27:44.116 --> 00:27:46.396 A:middle
tonight using happy hour or its

00:27:46.516 --> 00:27:48.516 A:middle
price, the data will be in

00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:50.066 A:middle
tabular format.

00:27:51.696 --> 00:27:55.076 A:middle
To handle the data which is in

00:27:55.076 --> 00:27:56.756 A:middle
tabular format, we actually

00:27:56.936 --> 00:27:59.846 A:middle
introduce a new data structure

00:27:59.846 --> 00:28:01.686 A:middle
which we call as MLDataTable.
