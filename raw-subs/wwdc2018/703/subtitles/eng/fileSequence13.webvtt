00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:01.696 A:middle
So we can delete the old model

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:02.686 A:middle
that we were using before.

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:04.786 A:middle
And in the view controller, we

00:13:04.786 --> 00:13:06.286 A:middle
can initialize this new one,

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:07.806 A:middle
ImageClassifier.

00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:11.676 A:middle
We can then re-run the app,

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:17.866 A:middle
bring up the simulator, and see

00:13:17.866 --> 00:13:18.946 A:middle
how it does on some of those

00:13:19.026 --> 00:13:19.356 A:middle
fruits.

00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:25.436 A:middle
On the raspberry, it can now

00:13:25.436 --> 00:13:27.366 A:middle
correctly predict it since we

00:13:27.366 --> 00:13:28.806 A:middle
trained the model to recognize

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:29.826 A:middle
raspberries.

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:31.736 A:middle
We can even see if it can

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:32.986 A:middle
distinguish from strawberries

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.126 A:middle
and it can now.

00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:39.236 A:middle
But there are other workflows

00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:39.826 A:middle
you can use.

00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:41.516 A:middle
Perhaps you want to do this

00:13:41.606 --> 00:13:43.356 A:middle
programmatically or perhaps you

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:44.056 A:middle
want to automate it.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.486 A:middle
We can also walk through how to

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:48.096 A:middle
use Create ML to do so.

00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:54.246 A:middle
So now we can switch to another

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:57.316 A:middle
playground and import Create ML.

00:13:57.866 --> 00:13:59.566 A:middle
Since we'll be using URLs, we

00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:01.386 A:middle
also can import foundation.
