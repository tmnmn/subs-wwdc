00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
Second, you just create your

00:32:03.646 --> 00:32:04.096 A:middle
model.

00:32:04.546 --> 00:32:05.966 A:middle
Third, you evaluate the model.

00:32:07.346 --> 00:32:09.126 A:middle
And once you're happy, you save

00:32:09.126 --> 00:32:09.386 A:middle
it out.

00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:13.856 A:middle
So tabular data, image data, or

00:32:14.086 --> 00:32:15.746 A:middle
text data, they all follow the

00:32:15.806 --> 00:32:17.206 A:middle
same pattern.

00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:21.466 A:middle
So let's just take a quick

00:32:21.466 --> 00:32:23.856 A:middle
summary of what we saw in this

00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:24.356 A:middle
session.

00:32:27.676 --> 00:32:30.466 A:middle
So Create ML is our ML framework

00:32:30.466 --> 00:32:30.896 A:middle
insert.

00:32:30.896 --> 00:32:33.156 A:middle
It's very simple to use and it

00:32:33.156 --> 00:32:34.876 A:middle
is very powerful and it

00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:35.836 A:middle
leverages core Apple

00:32:35.836 --> 00:32:36.836 A:middle
technologies.

00:32:36.836 --> 00:32:38.226 A:middle
You do end-to-end machine

00:32:38.226 --> 00:32:40.686 A:middle
learning in Swift on your Mac.

00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:45.116 A:middle
We also discussed about our

00:32:45.176 --> 00:32:46.036 A:middle
workflow.

00:32:46.976 --> 00:32:49.146 A:middle
Once again, you start from an

00:32:49.146 --> 00:32:49.896 A:middle
experience.

00:32:50.576 --> 00:32:51.576 A:middle
What is the experience you're

00:32:51.576 --> 00:32:52.366 A:middle
trying to enable?

00:32:53.716 --> 00:32:55.196 A:middle
Then define the problem.

00:32:55.946 --> 00:32:57.176 A:middle
Then collect the data.

00:32:57.456 --> 00:32:58.846 A:middle
Make sure this data is

00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:00.456 A:middle
reflective of the real-world
