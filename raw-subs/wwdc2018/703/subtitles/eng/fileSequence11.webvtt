00:11:00.676 --> 00:11:03.066 A:middle
And if we run it, we have some

00:11:03.116 --> 00:11:07.016 A:middle
fruits but it's not quite what I

00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:07.756 A:middle
was looking for.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.256 A:middle
I'd really like it if, instead,

00:11:11.356 --> 00:11:12.626 A:middle
we could classify these

00:11:12.686 --> 00:11:13.316 A:middle
particular ones.

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:15.796 A:middle
So what we can do is we can

00:11:15.886 --> 00:11:19.346 A:middle
switch to a new playground and

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.536 A:middle
import CreateMLUI and walk

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:24.166 A:middle
through how to do this using the

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.016 A:middle
UI for it.

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:27.276 A:middle
We can define a builder.

00:11:28.796 --> 00:11:29.576 A:middle
Initialize it.

00:11:29.576 --> 00:11:31.226 A:middle
And to enable drag-and-drop

00:11:31.276 --> 00:11:32.766 A:middle
training, we can show the

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.186 A:middle
builder in the live view.

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:40.696 A:middle
This brings up a prompt in the

00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:42.476 A:middle
live view to drag in images to

00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:43.306 A:middle
begin training.

00:11:44.886 --> 00:11:47.176 A:middle
And here I set aside some photos

00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:47.866 A:middle
of fruits.

00:11:48.746 --> 00:11:50.236 A:middle
Here's some blueberries and

00:11:50.236 --> 00:11:50.676 A:middle
other types.

00:11:51.746 --> 00:11:53.396 A:middle
And you can drag them in and

00:11:53.476 --> 00:11:54.626 A:middle
automatically an image

00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:56.366 A:middle
classifier model begins training

00:11:56.576 --> 00:11:57.056 A:middle
on the Mac.

00:11:57.916 --> 00:11:59.616 A:middle
All of this is accelerated by

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.806 A:middle
the GPU on however many
