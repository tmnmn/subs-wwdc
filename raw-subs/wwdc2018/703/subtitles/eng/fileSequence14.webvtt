00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:01.386 A:middle
also can import foundation.

00:14:03.686 --> 00:14:05.406 A:middle
And since, on our desktop, we

00:14:05.406 --> 00:14:06.826 A:middle
still have these folders of

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:09.776 A:middle
fruits, we can say where they

00:14:09.776 --> 00:14:14.586 A:middle
are and also say where the

00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:15.466 A:middle
testing fruits are.

00:14:15.466 --> 00:14:17.526 A:middle
And then the next step is to

00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:18.636 A:middle
actually train the model.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:22.376 A:middle
So we can define a model, and we

00:14:22.376 --> 00:14:23.716 A:middle
can initialize an image

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:24.386 A:middle
classifier.

00:14:25.206 --> 00:14:26.726 A:middle
And now if we take a look at

00:14:26.726 --> 00:14:28.166 A:middle
what auto complete shows to us,

00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:29.826 A:middle
we can see we can provide

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:31.006 A:middle
training data in the form of a

00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:33.016 A:middle
dictionary of labels to arrays

00:14:33.086 --> 00:14:36.056 A:middle
of images or we can use a data

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:38.616 A:middle
source or even specify model

00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:39.846 A:middle
training parameters if we want

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:40.046 A:middle
to.

00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:42.466 A:middle
Let's use a data source.

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:44.226 A:middle
And we'll use label directories

00:14:44.296 --> 00:14:45.366 A:middle
since that's how our data is

00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:47.576 A:middle
organized and specify the

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:48.436 A:middle
training directory.

00:14:50.526 --> 00:14:51.556 A:middle
And since we're running in the

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:52.946 A:middle
new [inaudible] mode of Xcode

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.226 A:middle
playground, I just need to hit

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.726 A:middle
shift enter and the model begins

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:57.796 A:middle
training right away.

00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:00.576 A:middle
You can even pull up the console
