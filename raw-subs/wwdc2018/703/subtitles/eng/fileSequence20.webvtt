00:19:58.426 --> 00:20:00.326 A:middle
data organization and you can

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.056 A:middle
actually organize your test data

00:20:02.056 --> 00:20:03.326 A:middle
in the exact same way.

00:20:06.376 --> 00:20:08.296 A:middle
Now with your training data and

00:20:08.296 --> 00:20:10.196 A:middle
test data ready, what other

00:20:10.196 --> 00:20:12.246 A:middle
steps involve to train such a

00:20:12.246 --> 00:20:13.196 A:middle
text classifier?

00:20:16.046 --> 00:20:17.806 A:middle
A typical workflow would look

00:20:17.806 --> 00:20:18.576 A:middle
something like this.

00:20:20.046 --> 00:20:21.396 A:middle
You start with your raw text.

00:20:22.286 --> 00:20:24.206 A:middle
You do a language identification

00:20:24.206 --> 00:20:25.536 A:middle
to figure out which language it

00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:25.906 A:middle
is in.

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.916 A:middle
You convert that into tokens.

00:20:30.306 --> 00:20:31.756 A:middle
And then you convert that into

00:20:31.756 --> 00:20:34.946 A:middle
some feature values and then you

00:20:34.946 --> 00:20:36.216 A:middle
can apply a machine learning

00:20:36.216 --> 00:20:38.536 A:middle
model that gives you some

00:20:38.536 --> 00:20:40.116 A:middle
predictive value that you have

00:20:40.116 --> 00:20:42.066 A:middle
to map to some desired label.

00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:44.126 A:middle
And then you can compare that

00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:46.256 A:middle
label to your truth label and

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:49.206 A:middle
start iterating on it.

00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:51.926 A:middle
With Create ML, though, we took

00:20:51.926 --> 00:20:54.666 A:middle
away all these complexities so

00:20:54.666 --> 00:20:56.696 A:middle
that all you need to do is to

00:20:56.696 --> 00:20:58.896 A:middle
prepare raw text with their

00:20:58.896 --> 00:21:01.226 A:middle
truth label and start training
