00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.806 A:middle
the GPU on however many

00:12:01.806 --> 00:12:03.336 A:middle
categories you end up training

00:12:03.336 --> 00:12:03.516 A:middle
on.

00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:06.036 A:middle
It automatically tells you what

00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:07.566 A:middle
the accuracy is on the training

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:09.526 A:middle
data set, but what's more

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:11.316 A:middle
helpful is to try this on new

00:12:11.316 --> 00:12:13.076 A:middle
images that the model hasn't

00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:15.006 A:middle
seen before to predict how it

00:12:15.006 --> 00:12:17.076 A:middle
will do on real use cases.

00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:18.846 A:middle
So I can drag in this other

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:20.696 A:middle
folder containing unseen images.

00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:23.376 A:middle
And now the model is evaluating

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:24.846 A:middle
all these new types of fruits.

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:26.896 A:middle
And if you scroll, you can see

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:28.566 A:middle
what the true label is of each

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:30.296 A:middle
type as well as with the

00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:31.756 A:middle
predicted one was by the model.

00:12:34.376 --> 00:12:36.406 A:middle
And if you're happy with this

00:12:36.406 --> 00:12:38.216 A:middle
accuracy, what you can do is you

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.976 A:middle
can take the model and drag it

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:40.406 A:middle
into your app.

00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:45.496 A:middle
I'll add it here.

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:48.036 A:middle
And if we take a look, this

00:12:48.076 --> 00:12:49.836 A:middle
model is 83 kilobytes.

00:12:50.396 --> 00:12:52.656 A:middle
It's a huge savings down from

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:53.206 A:middle
hundreds.

00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:59.736 A:middle
