00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:00.396 A:middle
file will look something like

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
this.

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:04.106 A:middle
As I said before, this key is

00:05:04.106 --> 00:05:05.576 A:middle
meant to be a secret between you

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:06.136 A:middle
and Apple.

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.516 A:middle
This is the only time you'll be

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.006 A:middle
able to download your auth key

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:10.446 A:middle
file.

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:12.416 A:middle
We recommend you quickly save it

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:13.236 A:middle
somewhere safe.

00:05:14.296 --> 00:05:16.576 A:middle
If you ever lose your key or it

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:18.426 A:middle
is compromised, you can always

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:19.816 A:middle
come back to the Apple Developer

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:21.436 A:middle
website to revoke it and create

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:21.946 A:middle
a new key.

00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:26.976 A:middle
You just created a MapKit JS

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:27.356 A:middle
key.

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:29.536 A:middle
Now we will create authorization

00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:31.246 A:middle
tokens which can be used to

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.066 A:middle
authorize MapKit JS over the

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:33.326 A:middle
web.

00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:38.246 A:middle
Tokens are created containing

00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:40.086 A:middle
your developer credentials and

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:41.626 A:middle
are signed with your auth key

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:42.116 A:middle
file.

00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:44.586 A:middle
Claims are added to this token,

00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:46.256 A:middle
which are used by Apple to

00:05:46.256 --> 00:05:48.386 A:middle
verify a client's authorization.

00:05:49.846 --> 00:05:51.576 A:middle
Let's dive deeper into how to

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:53.406 A:middle
make authorization tokens.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:57.426 A:middle
MapKit JS authorization tokens

00:05:57.426 --> 00:06:00.786 A:middle
are based on JSON Web Tokens RFC
