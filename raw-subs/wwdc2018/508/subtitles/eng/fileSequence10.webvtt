00:09:59.506 --> 00:10:00.556 A:middle
have a route on your server

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:02.126 A:middle
which returns a token looking

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:03.076 A:middle
something like this.

00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:06.956 A:middle
A long-lived token is different.

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:09.096 A:middle
Its expiry is set much further

00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:09.336 A:middle
out.

00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:11.536 A:middle
You can use the same token for

00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:12.956 A:middle
many requests over a longer

00:10:12.956 --> 00:10:13.696 A:middle
period of time.

00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:15.876 A:middle
This type of token doesn't

00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:18.126 A:middle
require a server since the token

00:10:18.126 --> 00:10:19.936 A:middle
is not likely to expire during a

00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:20.776 A:middle
user's session.

00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:23.866 A:middle
For that reason, it can be

00:10:23.866 --> 00:10:25.886 A:middle
easily used on static websites

00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:27.146 A:middle
or in development environments.

00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:29.846 A:middle
You can sync expiration and

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.916 A:middle
renewal of this token with your

00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:32.756 A:middle
release cycle.

00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:34.776 A:middle
We strongly recommend that you

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.236 A:middle
attach an origin claim to

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:37.246 A:middle
long-lived tokens.

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:38.676 A:middle
Let's see how this is done.

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:42.246 A:middle
In this example, we set

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:43.946 A:middle
long-lived tokens to expire in

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:44.656 A:middle
six months.

00:10:45.356 --> 00:10:47.216 A:middle
As I said before, you can tailor

00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:48.326 A:middle
this to your application's

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:48.746 A:middle
needs.

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:51.006 A:middle
For example, if your team has a

00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:53.246 A:middle
two-week release cycle, you can

00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:54.966 A:middle
set your expectation to sync

00:10:54.966 --> 00:10:57.186 A:middle
with that or even add a couple

00:10:57.186 --> 00:10:58.166 A:middle
weeks as a buffer.

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:02.246 A:middle
Setting the origin claim is
