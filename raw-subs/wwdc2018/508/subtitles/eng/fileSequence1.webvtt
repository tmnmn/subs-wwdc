00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:00.216 A:middle
See a map you like?

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.016 A:middle
View its source, see how it

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:02.526 A:middle
works.

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:04.135 A:middle
It's certainly how I learned.

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:07.396 A:middle
Unfortunately, that sometimes

00:01:07.396 --> 00:01:08.596 A:middle
means that your API

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:10.006 A:middle
authorization credentials can

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:11.796 A:middle
get copied and used by mistake

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.076 A:middle
without your permission and that

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:16.106 A:middle
unauthorized use can count

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:17.316 A:middle
against your usage limits.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:19.846 A:middle
Once the limit is reached, your

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.526 A:middle
site may no longer be able to

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:22.426 A:middle
display maps.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.946 A:middle
The MapKit JS authorization

00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:26.066 A:middle
system is designed to give you

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.456 A:middle
more control over how your

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:28.566 A:middle
credentials are used.

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:31.806 A:middle
You can set a time when access

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:34.306 A:middle
should expire and restrict

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:35.966 A:middle
access to a specific domain.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:38.306 A:middle
It's the web and others will

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.576 A:middle
still be able to view course and

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:40.386 A:middle
poke around in the web

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:42.436 A:middle
inspector, but if somebody ends

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.666 A:middle
up with your credentials for any

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.016 A:middle
reason, there will be limits on

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:45.936 A:middle
how they can use it.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:50.076 A:middle
Let's discuss how MapKit JS

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.406 A:middle
authorization works at a high

00:01:51.406 --> 00:01:51.836 A:middle
level.

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.956 A:middle
Once you have a MapKit JS key,

00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:56.916 A:middle
you'll save it somewhere safe.

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:58.796 A:middle
This will never be shared over

00:01:58.796 --> 00:01:59.236 A:middle
the web.

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:01.616 A:middle
Instead, you'll create tokens
