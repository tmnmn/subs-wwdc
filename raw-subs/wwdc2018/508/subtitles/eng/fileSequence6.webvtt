00:05:57.426 --> 00:06:00.786 A:middle
are based on JSON Web Tokens RFC

00:06:00.786 --> 00:06:04.416 A:middle
7519, or JWT for short.

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:06.256 A:middle
This is an industry standard

00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:07.856 A:middle
designed to specifically

00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:10.406 A:middle
transmit authorization claims

00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:11.046 A:middle
over the web.

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:14.036 A:middle
You can find more information on

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:16.316 A:middle
this standard at jwt.io.

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.266 A:middle
There you will also find

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:21.756 A:middle
libraries for signing JWT tokens

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.386 A:middle
in most programming languages.

00:06:25.226 --> 00:06:27.466 A:middle
All JWT tokens are made of the

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:28.666 A:middle
following three parts.

00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:33.216 A:middle
A header, a payload, and a

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:36.376 A:middle
signature separated by periods

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:38.876 A:middle
and each Base64 URL encoded,

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:41.056 A:middle
making a token which can easily

00:06:41.056 --> 00:06:42.696 A:middle
be passed to a request header.

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:46.726 A:middle
We have two recommended JWT

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:47.996 A:middle
configurations for your

00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:50.256 A:middle
authorization token: short-lived

00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:52.376 A:middle
tokens and long-lived tokens.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.006 A:middle
Let's start with short-lived

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:56.536 A:middle
tokens.

00:06:57.076 --> 00:06:58.726 A:middle
These authorization tokens offer

00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:00.206 A:middle
the most protection against
