00:08:55.566 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
This must be set to ES256, which

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.276 A:middle
when passed to your JWT signing

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:05.326 A:middle
library will output a JWT token

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:07.756 A:middle
ready to be used by MapKit JS.

00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:09.996 A:middle
Since short-lived tokens may

00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:11.706 A:middle
expire before your user is done

00:09:11.706 --> 00:09:13.336 A:middle
with their session, your server

00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:14.926 A:middle
will need to provide an endpoint

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:16.916 A:middle
for MapKit JS which will respond

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:18.316 A:middle
to requests to new tokens.

00:09:18.936 --> 00:09:20.426 A:middle
Later, I'll show you how to make

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.906 A:middle
MapKit JS aware of your

00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:23.856 A:middle
endpoint, but for now, here's an

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.286 A:middle
example of an endpoint that I've

00:09:25.286 --> 00:09:27.326 A:middle
created as an express JS route.

00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:30.546 A:middle
This route simply returns a new

00:09:30.546 --> 00:09:32.626 A:middle
access token set to expire in

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:35.496 A:middle
1800 seconds or 30 minutes every

00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:36.256 A:middle
time it's called.

00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:38.326 A:middle
Regardless of your token's

00:09:38.326 --> 00:09:40.976 A:middle
expiry, MapKit JS will call this

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:42.456 A:middle
endpoint any time it needs to

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:44.176 A:middle
authorize throughout a user's

00:09:44.176 --> 00:09:44.966 A:middle
active session.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.236 A:middle
Since your endpoint needs to

00:09:48.236 --> 00:09:49.896 A:middle
return a new token every time

00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:51.566 A:middle
it's called, you'll need to let

00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:53.166 A:middle
browsers know not to cache.

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:55.426 A:middle
You can do this by setting cache

00:09:55.426 --> 00:09:56.316 A:middle
control headers.

00:09:57.856 --> 00:09:59.506 A:middle
If set up correctly, you should

00:09:59.506 --> 00:10:00.556 A:middle
have a route on your server
