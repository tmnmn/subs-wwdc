00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.866 A:middle
You may want to create different

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.366 A:middle
identifiers for production and

00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:03.546 A:middle
development environments.

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:05.846 A:middle
To create a maps identifier,

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:09.196 A:middle
select Maps IDs from the menu.

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:12.236 A:middle
Click the + button in the upper

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:12.626 A:middle
right.

00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:15.096 A:middle
Give this identifier a

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:15.786 A:middle
description.

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:17.336 A:middle
The description should be the

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:19.056 A:middle
name of your website as it will

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:19.866 A:middle
appear to users.

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:22.916 A:middle
Give this identifier a unique

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:23.306 A:middle
ID.

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.626 A:middle
We recommend using reverse

00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:27.676 A:middle
domain style for this ID and it

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:28.786 A:middle
will need to start with the

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:29.836 A:middle
string maps.

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:32.916 A:middle
For example,

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:37.926 A:middle
maps.com.yourdomainname.yourapp.

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:41.926 A:middle
Now we'll create a MapKit JS

00:03:41.926 --> 00:03:42.306 A:middle
key.

00:03:42.816 --> 00:03:44.286 A:middle
This key is a secret shared

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.136 A:middle
between you and Apple and should

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:47.396 A:middle
never be stored in front end

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:48.966 A:middle
code, checked into source

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:50.716 A:middle
control, or shared with others.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:54.776 A:middle
First, click on All under the

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.526 A:middle
Keys subheading in the left-hand

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:56.836 A:middle
menu.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:00.886 A:middle
Then, click the + icon in the
