00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:00.206 A:middle
the most protection against

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:02.186 A:middle
misuse by ensuring that

00:07:02.186 --> 00:07:03.966 A:middle
authorization tokens can't be

00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:05.896 A:middle
used for long if copied from

00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:06.596 A:middle
your source code.

00:07:07.836 --> 00:07:09.196 A:middle
This approach requires that you

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:11.026 A:middle
provide a server endpoint to

00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:13.126 A:middle
respond to requests for MapKit

00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:14.946 A:middle
JS for new authorization tokens.

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:17.776 A:middle
MapKit will refresh from this

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:19.436 A:middle
endpoint any time it needs to

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:21.196 A:middle
authorize throughout a user's

00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:21.706 A:middle
session.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.766 A:middle
First, the payload must contain

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:28.676 A:middle
an ISS claim, which is your

00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:30.476 A:middle
Apple Developer Program ID.

00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:34.066 A:middle
You can find your Team ID in the

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.716 A:middle
account section of the Apple

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:36.726 A:middle
Developer website.

00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:40.696 A:middle
An IAT claim, which is when this

00:07:40.696 --> 00:07:42.796 A:middle
authorization token was issued

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
in seconds.

00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:47.146 A:middle
An EXP claim, which is when this

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:48.846 A:middle
authorization token is meant to

00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:50.166 A:middle
expire in seconds.

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:52.536 A:middle
For short-lived tokens, we

00:07:52.536 --> 00:07:53.736 A:middle
recommend 30 minutes.

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:56.516 A:middle
And, finally, a claim of origin.

00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.526 A:middle
This can restrict browser access

00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:01.536 A:middle
by matching the origin header
