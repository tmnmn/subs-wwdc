00:54:58.566 --> 00:55:00.326 A:middle
working with threads you can use

00:55:00.326 --> 00:55:01.646 A:middle
custom names with threads as

00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:01.876 A:middle
well.

00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:04.406 A:middle
These names and labels are

00:55:04.406 --> 00:55:05.756 A:middle
displayed in the debugger but

00:55:05.756 --> 00:55:07.606 A:middle
they also appear in some types

00:55:07.606 --> 00:55:09.646 A:middle
of crash logs and that can help

00:55:09.646 --> 00:55:11.306 A:middle
you often narrow down possible

00:55:11.306 --> 00:55:14.616 A:middle
causes of multithreading bugs.

00:55:15.556 --> 00:55:16.896 A:middle
Okay so to stay on top of

00:55:16.896 --> 00:55:19.116 A:middle
crashes I have three takeaway

00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:19.776 A:middle
points for you.

00:55:20.556 --> 00:55:22.656 A:middle
Number one, always test your

00:55:22.656 --> 00:55:25.276 A:middle
apps on real devices before

00:55:25.276 --> 00:55:26.356 A:middle
submitting them to the App

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.626 A:middle
Store, that will help you avoid

00:55:28.626 --> 00:55:30.506 A:middle
getting rejected in App Review.

00:55:31.796 --> 00:55:33.416 A:middle
Number two, when you do get

00:55:33.606 --> 00:55:35.386 A:middle
crashes from your users you

00:55:35.386 --> 00:55:36.686 A:middle
should always try to reproduce

00:55:36.686 --> 00:55:36.866 A:middle
them.

00:55:37.506 --> 00:55:39.126 A:middle
Look at the crash logs and look

00:55:39.126 --> 00:55:40.356 A:middle
at the stack traces and try to

00:55:40.356 --> 00:55:41.846 A:middle
figure out which parts of your

00:55:41.846 --> 00:55:43.886 A:middle
app do you need to exercise to

00:55:43.886 --> 00:55:45.456 A:middle
trigger a crash or to try to

00:55:45.456 --> 00:55:46.336 A:middle
reproduce the crash.

00:55:46.906 --> 00:55:49.166 A:middle
And finally, for crashes that

00:55:49.166 --> 00:55:50.936 A:middle
are hard to reproduce I

00:55:50.936 --> 00:55:52.446 A:middle
recommend using bug finding

00:55:52.446 --> 00:55:54.216 A:middle
tools, such as Address Sanitizer

00:55:54.216 --> 00:55:56.486 A:middle
or Thread Sanitizer which work

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:58.096 A:middle
for editing memory corruption

00:55:58.096 --> 00:55:59.216 A:middle
bugs and multithreading

00:55:59.216 --> 00:55:59.706 A:middle
problems.
