00:53:58.536 --> 00:54:00.126 A:middle
So you should keep that in mind

00:54:00.126 --> 00:54:01.356 A:middle
and make sure that your

00:54:01.686 --> 00:54:03.966 A:middle
automated or manual testing uses

00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:05.366 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer, especially on

00:54:05.366 --> 00:54:06.996 A:middle
any code that is using threading

00:54:06.996 --> 00:54:07.356 A:middle
or GCD.

00:54:07.356 --> 00:54:10.846 A:middle
And if you'd like to know more I

00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:12.366 A:middle
recommend that you watch a video

00:54:12.366 --> 00:54:15.486 A:middle
from my WWDC 2016 session called

00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:16.786 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer and Static

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:18.206 A:middle
Analysis where we have

00:54:18.336 --> 00:54:20.346 A:middle
introduced this tool and we also

00:54:20.486 --> 00:54:21.936 A:middle
talked about how it works under

00:54:21.936 --> 00:54:22.226 A:middle
the hood.

00:54:22.596 --> 00:54:25.566 A:middle
As a reminder, Thread Sanitizer

00:54:25.566 --> 00:54:26.926 A:middle
can be found in the Scheme

00:54:26.926 --> 00:54:27.206 A:middle
Editor.

00:54:27.686 --> 00:54:29.686 A:middle
So if you go to Product, Scheme

00:54:29.956 --> 00:54:32.006 A:middle
and Edit Scheme that will bring

00:54:32.006 --> 00:54:32.956 A:middle
up the Scheme Editor.

00:54:32.956 --> 00:54:34.646 A:middle
And then we can switch over to

00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:36.026 A:middle
the Diagnostics tab where you

00:54:36.026 --> 00:54:37.836 A:middle
can find Thread Sanitizer among

00:54:37.836 --> 00:54:39.536 A:middle
the other runtime diagnostic

00:54:39.586 --> 00:54:39.976 A:middle
tools.

00:54:41.216 --> 00:54:43.546 A:middle
I have one more debugging tip

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.516 A:middle
that I would like to share with

00:54:44.516 --> 00:54:46.136 A:middle
you that's useful when dealing

00:54:46.176 --> 00:54:46.986 A:middle
with multithreading.

00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:49.686 A:middle
When you are creating dispatch

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.906 A:middle
queues you can provide a custom

00:54:51.906 --> 00:54:53.216 A:middle
label in the initializer.

00:54:54.576 --> 00:54:56.266 A:middle
You can assign a custom name to

00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:58.566 A:middle
an operation queue and if you're

00:54:58.566 --> 00:55:00.326 A:middle
working with threads you can use
