00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.546 A:middle
Address Sanitizer and the

00:41:00.546 --> 00:41:02.576 A:middle
Zombies instrument to try and

00:41:02.576 --> 00:41:03.726 A:middle
reproduce the crash.

00:41:04.116 --> 00:41:05.976 A:middle
Because even though we did a

00:41:05.976 --> 00:41:07.636 A:middle
good job with the malloc free

00:41:07.636 --> 00:41:09.936 A:middle
list crash log of narrowing down

00:41:09.936 --> 00:41:11.996 A:middle
what happened it's a lot easier

00:41:11.996 --> 00:41:13.636 A:middle
to debug crashes when they occur

00:41:13.716 --> 00:41:16.456 A:middle
in a debugger, in a test with

00:41:16.456 --> 00:41:18.396 A:middle
Sanitization error messages

00:41:18.396 --> 00:41:19.546 A:middle
telling you what went on.

00:41:20.066 --> 00:41:23.106 A:middle
So a moment ago I mentioned

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.586 A:middle
looking up multiple stack

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:26.826 A:middle
traces, multiple thread stacks

00:41:27.066 --> 00:41:28.286 A:middle
in order to diagnose

00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:29.516 A:middle
multithreading errors.

00:41:30.066 --> 00:41:32.616 A:middle
And to talk more about debugging

00:41:32.616 --> 00:41:34.156 A:middle
multithreading errors let me

00:41:34.156 --> 00:41:34.976 A:middle
introduce Kuba.

00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:40.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:41.196 --> 00:41:41.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:43.646 --> 00:41:44.076 A:middle
Thank you.

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.356 A:middle
As Greg mentioned, some memory

00:41:47.356 --> 00:41:49.036 A:middle
corruptions can be caused by

00:41:49.036 --> 00:41:50.126 A:middle
multithreading issues.

00:41:51.146 --> 00:41:52.906 A:middle
Multithreading bugs are often

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:54.496 A:middle
one of the hardest types of bugs

00:41:54.646 --> 00:41:56.436 A:middle
to diagnose and reproduce.

00:41:57.236 --> 00:41:58.436 A:middle
They get especially hard to

00:41:58.436 --> 00:41:59.866 A:middle
reproduce because they only

00:41:59.866 --> 00:42:01.296 A:middle
cause crashes once in a while,
