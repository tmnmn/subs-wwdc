00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:01.946 A:middle
and eventually we get to this

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.756 A:middle
point where we hit a point where

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:05.926 A:middle
in your code where the only

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.236 A:middle
option is to crash, something

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:08.006 A:middle
has gone wrong.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.516 A:middle
And ultimately the debugger

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:12.126 A:middle
receives a signal that this app

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:14.986 A:middle
is about to crash and pauses the

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:16.106 A:middle
app.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:18.326 A:middle
Now sometimes you're not always

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:19.686 A:middle
conveniently attached with the

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:20.886 A:middle
debugger like we are here.

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:23.006 A:middle
When you're not attached with

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:24.736 A:middle
the debugger the operating

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:25.846 A:middle
system will capture this

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.666 A:middle
backtrace in plaintext and save

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.976 A:middle
it out to disk in a human

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.056 A:middle
readable crash log.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.906 A:middle
Now the truth is one a release

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:36.226 A:middle
build of your app crashes the

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:37.476 A:middle
log doesn't actually look this

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:37.996 A:middle
pretty.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.726 A:middle
What's actually written out is a

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:41.266 A:middle
list of binary names and

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:41.636 A:middle
addresses.

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:43.266 A:middle
This is a snippet from a

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.626 A:middle
unsymbolicated crash log.

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:47.566 A:middle
Now thankfully Xcode takes care

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.146 A:middle
of symbolicating crash logs so

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:50.256 A:middle
that what you'll see are those

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:51.846 A:middle
pretty function names, file

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:53.386 A:middle
names and line numbers that

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:54.006 A:middle
you're familiar with.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
So there are a number of ways to

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
access these crash logs.
