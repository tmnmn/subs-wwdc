00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.206 A:middle
information in the crash log

00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:01.226 A:middle
that will tell us more about

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.906 A:middle
what happened?

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.256 A:middle
We can look at the invalid

00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:08.356 A:middle
address itself, sometimes the

00:26:08.356 --> 00:26:10.966 A:middle
actual bad address value will

00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:12.856 A:middle
contain useful information in

00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:13.586 A:middle
it.

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:16.006 A:middle
And this particular bad address

00:26:16.006 --> 00:26:18.556 A:middle
I can tell you looks like a use

00:26:18.606 --> 00:26:19.536 A:middle
after free.

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:21.566 A:middle
Well how do I know that?

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:22.946 A:middle
Partly it's just long

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:24.336 A:middle
experience, when you read enough

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.246 A:middle
crash logs you start to learn

00:26:26.246 --> 00:26:28.316 A:middle
patterns of what the bad values

00:26:28.396 --> 00:26:28.736 A:middle
are.

00:26:29.856 --> 00:26:32.886 A:middle
This particular bad value looks

00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:35.296 A:middle
very much like the address range

00:26:35.296 --> 00:26:37.906 A:middle
for the malloc memory allocator

00:26:38.246 --> 00:26:39.416 A:middle
which we happen to have

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.966 A:middle
available in this crash log.

00:26:41.616 --> 00:26:43.196 A:middle
So we have the address range

00:26:43.196 --> 00:26:44.486 A:middle
that was used by the memory

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:46.656 A:middle
allocator and our invalid

00:26:46.656 --> 00:26:49.526 A:middle
address looks like it's inside

00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:51.836 A:middle
the malloc range, but it's been

00:26:51.836 --> 00:26:53.756 A:middle
shifted by 4 bits, it's been

00:26:53.756 --> 00:26:55.386 A:middle
rotated by 4 bits.

00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
So it looks like it was a valid

00:26:57.566 --> 00:26:59.686 A:middle
malloc address rotated.
