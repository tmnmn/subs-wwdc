00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
release?

00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:01.806 A:middle
We can look at the rest of the

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:02.636 A:middle
stack trace.

00:25:03.226 --> 00:25:05.286 A:middle
We have the object dispose

00:25:05.286 --> 00:25:07.526 A:middle
function, this is a function in

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:09.376 A:middle
the Objective-C runtime that is

00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:11.176 A:middle
used to deallocate objects.

00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:14.086 A:middle
The object dispose function

00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:16.426 A:middle
called a function called ivar

00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:18.716 A:middle
destroyer on one of our classes,

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:20.956 A:middle
our LoginViewController class.

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:24.176 A:middle
The ivar destroyer function is

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:26.166 A:middle
part of Swift code, this is a

00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.516 A:middle
function that cleans up the

00:25:27.516 --> 00:25:29.466 A:middle
properties, that cleans up the

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:31.776 A:middle
ivar storage of an object as it

00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:32.686 A:middle
is deallocated.

00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.386 A:middle
So that gives us part of the

00:25:35.386 --> 00:25:36.966 A:middle
story as to what caused this

00:25:36.966 --> 00:25:37.446 A:middle
crash.

00:25:37.956 --> 00:25:39.856 A:middle
We were deallocating an object

00:25:39.946 --> 00:25:41.956 A:middle
of our login view controller

00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:42.526 A:middle
class.

00:25:43.536 --> 00:25:46.156 A:middle
That class in its d init code

00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:47.556 A:middle
was trying to clean up its

00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:49.816 A:middle
properties and its ivars and

00:25:49.816 --> 00:25:51.536 A:middle
while releasing one of those

00:25:51.536 --> 00:25:53.266 A:middle
properties we crashed.

00:25:53.266 --> 00:25:55.716 A:middle
So that gives us a little bit of

00:25:55.716 --> 00:25:56.876 A:middle
detail as to what went wrong.

00:25:56.906 --> 00:25:58.826 A:middle
Can we do better, is there more

00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.206 A:middle
information in the crash log
