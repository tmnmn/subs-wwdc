00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:00.036 A:middle
used to be.

00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:03.836 A:middle
With one slight twist, it does

00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:05.146 A:middle
not write a pointer into that

00:28:05.146 --> 00:28:07.536 A:middle
field it writes a rotated

00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:08.986 A:middle
pointer into that field.

00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:10.956 A:middle
It wants to make sure that the

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:13.506 A:middle
value written there is not a

00:28:13.506 --> 00:28:16.016 A:middle
valid memory address precisely

00:28:16.016 --> 00:28:17.786 A:middle
so that bad use of the object

00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:18.756 A:middle
will crash.

00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:22.366 A:middle
So when objc release goes to

00:28:22.366 --> 00:28:24.366 A:middle
read the isa field it instead

00:28:24.416 --> 00:28:26.246 A:middle
gets a rotated free list

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:26.736 A:middle
pointer.

00:28:27.396 --> 00:28:29.056 A:middle
When it dreferences the rotated

00:28:29.056 --> 00:28:30.926 A:middle
free list pointer it crashes.

00:28:31.926 --> 00:28:33.296 A:middle
The memory allocator did that

00:28:33.296 --> 00:28:34.986 A:middle
for us, it deliberately rotated

00:28:34.986 --> 00:28:36.716 A:middle
that pointer to make sure we

00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:38.166 A:middle
would crash if we tried to use

00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:38.616 A:middle
it again.

00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:42.146 A:middle
So that is the signature we see

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:43.196 A:middle
in this crash log.

00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:45.716 A:middle
We had the invalid address field

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:48.536 A:middle
looks like a pointer in the

00:28:48.536 --> 00:28:50.686 A:middle
malloc region but rotated the

00:28:50.686 --> 00:28:52.626 A:middle
same way that malloc rotates its

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:53.566 A:middle
free list pointers.

00:28:54.186 --> 00:28:56.076 A:middle
So that's a strong sign that

00:28:56.976 --> 00:28:58.706 A:middle
whatever object we are trying to

00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:00.056 A:middle
release at this point in the
