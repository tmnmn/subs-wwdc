00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.306 A:middle
stacks, these were the

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:02.166 A:middle
backtraces of all the threads

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:03.276 A:middle
that were running at the time of

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:03.906 A:middle
the crash.

00:14:04.506 --> 00:14:05.666 A:middle
One of them is marked as the

00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:08.436 A:middle
crash thread and we also have

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:09.526 A:middle
whatever other threads were

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:11.196 A:middle
running at the time that the

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.056 A:middle
process died.

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:15.676 A:middle
Below that we have some

00:14:15.676 --> 00:14:17.326 A:middle
low-level information, we have

00:14:17.376 --> 00:14:19.806 A:middle
the register state of the thread

00:14:19.806 --> 00:14:21.916 A:middle
that crashed and we have the

00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:23.816 A:middle
binary images that were loaded

00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:25.196 A:middle
into the process.

00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:27.046 A:middle
This is the application

00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:28.686 A:middle
executable and all the other

00:14:28.686 --> 00:14:29.666 A:middle
libraries.

00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:32.176 A:middle
And Xcode uses this for

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.556 A:middle
symbolication in order to look

00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:37.306 A:middle
up the symbols, the files and

00:14:37.306 --> 00:14:38.866 A:middle
line number information for the

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:39.656 A:middle
stack traces.

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:42.576 A:middle
So that's the content of a crash

00:14:42.576 --> 00:14:43.156 A:middle
log file.

00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:45.696 A:middle
So how do we debug this, how do

00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:47.026 A:middle
we read this, what do we look

00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:47.306 A:middle
at?

00:14:48.446 --> 00:14:51.066 A:middle
We start with the crash reason,

00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:52.316 A:middle
the exception type.

00:14:53.156 --> 00:14:54.736 A:middle
In this case, the exception type

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:56.796 A:middle
is an EXC bad instruction

00:14:56.856 --> 00:15:00.816 A:middle
exception, the SIGILL signal was
