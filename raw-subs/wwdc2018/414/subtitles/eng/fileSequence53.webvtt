00:52:59.866 --> 00:53:01.206 A:middle
warnings because the class is

00:53:01.206 --> 00:53:02.806 A:middle
now correctly thread safe.

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.126 A:middle
So I can actually go back to our

00:53:04.126 --> 00:53:06.476 A:middle
Organizer window and mark this

00:53:07.576 --> 00:53:08.756 A:middle
crash as resolved because we

00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:10.486 A:middle
have found, identified, and

00:53:10.486 --> 00:53:10.976 A:middle
fixed this bug.

00:53:11.516 --> 00:53:18.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:53:21.286 --> 00:53:23.446 A:middle
All right so what we've just

00:53:23.446 --> 00:53:25.426 A:middle
seen is that I've started with a

00:53:25.426 --> 00:53:27.256 A:middle
set of crash logs that all have

00:53:27.256 --> 00:53:28.746 A:middle
symptoms of a multithreading

00:53:28.746 --> 00:53:28.946 A:middle
bug.

00:53:29.436 --> 00:53:30.596 A:middle
And then I've used this tool

00:53:30.636 --> 00:53:32.056 A:middle
called Thread Sanitizer to

00:53:32.056 --> 00:53:34.186 A:middle
identify and eventually fix this

00:53:34.186 --> 00:53:34.436 A:middle
bug.

00:53:35.576 --> 00:53:36.756 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer not only

00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:38.406 A:middle
detects multithreading issues,

00:53:38.456 --> 00:53:40.626 A:middle
but it also makes them reproduce

00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:41.626 A:middle
much more reliably.

00:53:42.276 --> 00:53:43.866 A:middle
Notice that in the demo I didn't

00:53:43.866 --> 00:53:45.356 A:middle
have to invoke the controller

00:53:45.356 --> 00:53:46.256 A:middle
multiple times.

00:53:47.436 --> 00:53:49.386 A:middle
This tool works on macOS and in

00:53:49.386 --> 00:53:51.846 A:middle
the Simulator, but just like all

00:53:51.846 --> 00:53:53.446 A:middle
other runtime diagnostic tools

00:53:53.506 --> 00:53:56.176 A:middle
it only finds bugs in codes that

00:53:56.176 --> 00:53:57.786 A:middle
you exercise by actually running

00:53:57.786 --> 00:53:57.906 A:middle
it.

00:53:58.536 --> 00:54:00.126 A:middle
So you should keep that in mind
