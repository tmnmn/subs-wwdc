00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:00.476 A:middle
the code that can access

00:51:00.536 --> 00:51:00.946 A:middle
storage.

00:51:01.146 --> 00:51:02.676 A:middle
It's either going to be code in

00:51:02.676 --> 00:51:04.536 A:middle
this getter or the setter, no

00:51:04.536 --> 00:51:06.066 A:middle
other code in my app has access

00:51:06.116 --> 00:51:06.336 A:middle
to it.

00:51:06.646 --> 00:51:08.046 A:middle
So I'm in a very good position

00:51:08.046 --> 00:51:09.696 A:middle
to actually fix this Swift

00:51:09.696 --> 00:51:10.436 A:middle
access race.

00:51:11.796 --> 00:51:13.216 A:middle
And let me do that by using a

00:51:13.216 --> 00:51:13.856 A:middle
dispatch queue.

00:51:14.066 --> 00:51:15.976 A:middle
So let's create a new private

00:51:15.976 --> 00:51:17.766 A:middle
variable called queue and let's

00:51:17.766 --> 00:51:19.976 A:middle
assign a new dispatch queue into

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:20.076 A:middle
it.

00:51:21.346 --> 00:51:23.296 A:middle
Dispatch queues are serial by

00:51:23.296 --> 00:51:24.446 A:middle
default, so this one is also

00:51:24.446 --> 00:51:25.886 A:middle
serial, which means that it will

00:51:25.886 --> 00:51:28.136 A:middle
only allow one piece of code to

00:51:28.136 --> 00:51:30.336 A:middle
execute inside that queue at a

00:51:30.336 --> 00:51:30.726 A:middle
time.

00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:32.556 A:middle
So that's perfect, that's

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:33.776 A:middle
exactly what we need here.

00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:36.236 A:middle
How do we actually execute code

00:51:36.236 --> 00:51:37.406 A:middle
inside a dispatch queue?

00:51:37.766 --> 00:51:40.066 A:middle
We can use queue.sync and

00:51:40.066 --> 00:51:42.076 A:middle
whatever code I move into

00:51:42.186 --> 00:51:45.756 A:middle
queue.sync will be executed

00:51:45.856 --> 00:51:47.246 A:middle
inside that serial queue and

00:51:47.246 --> 00:51:48.146 A:middle
only one at a time.

00:51:48.676 --> 00:51:50.256 A:middle
And I can return a value here

00:51:50.256 --> 00:51:51.446 A:middle
because I need to return

00:51:51.446 --> 00:51:52.316 A:middle
something from the getter.

00:51:53.476 --> 00:51:55.406 A:middle
And I can fix the same thing in

00:51:55.406 --> 00:51:56.146 A:middle
the setter as well.

00:51:56.316 --> 00:51:58.926 A:middle
And if I move this line of code

00:51:59.126 --> 00:52:01.296 A:middle
into this queue.sync it will be
