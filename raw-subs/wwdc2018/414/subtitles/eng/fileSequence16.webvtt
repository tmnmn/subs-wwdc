00:15:57.736 --> 00:16:01.356 A:middle
function being called and that

00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:03.116 A:middle
function in turn called fatal

00:16:03.116 --> 00:16:04.736 A:middle
error message as a result of

00:16:04.736 --> 00:16:05.476 A:middle
some error.

00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:08.736 A:middle
Because this is a symbolicated

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:10.426 A:middle
stack trace with full debug

00:16:10.426 --> 00:16:12.376 A:middle
information we have a file and

00:16:12.376 --> 00:16:14.856 A:middle
line number in our code of what

00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:15.566 A:middle
the crash was.

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:17.856 A:middle
So we can take a look at that

00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:19.506 A:middle
line, we can open up our

00:16:19.506 --> 00:16:20.706 A:middle
project, this is

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:24.316 A:middle
RecipeImage.swift, line 26 was

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:25.276 A:middle
the one that was marked in the

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:25.806 A:middle
crash.

00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:27.926 A:middle
And those of you who are

00:16:27.926 --> 00:16:29.436 A:middle
experienced Swift programmers

00:16:29.436 --> 00:16:31.066 A:middle
will have a pretty good guess as

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:32.896 A:middle
to why this line might crash.

00:16:33.946 --> 00:16:36.836 A:middle
We have a force unwrap operator.

00:16:37.766 --> 00:16:40.076 A:middle
We have a function, The UIImage

00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:41.516 A:middle
Constructor which returns an

00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:42.746 A:middle
optional value.

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:45.696 A:middle
If the optional value is nil the

00:16:45.696 --> 00:16:48.596 A:middle
force unwrap operator will halt

00:16:48.596 --> 00:16:50.726 A:middle
the process, generate a crash

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:52.186 A:middle
log and exit.

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:54.856 A:middle
If we remember the

00:16:54.856 --> 00:16:56.906 A:middle
application-specific information

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.926 A:middle
it included the error message

00:16:59.046 --> 00:17:01.256 A:middle
that the Swift runtime prints as
