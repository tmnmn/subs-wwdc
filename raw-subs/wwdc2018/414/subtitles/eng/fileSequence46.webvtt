00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:00.336 A:middle
reproduce this crash.

00:46:00.656 --> 00:46:02.496 A:middle
And let me close the crash log

00:46:02.496 --> 00:46:03.076 A:middle
session first.

00:46:03.076 --> 00:46:05.616 A:middle
All right, so this is our

00:46:05.616 --> 00:46:07.386 A:middle
cookies recipe again and you'll

00:46:07.386 --> 00:46:09.256 A:middle
notice that if I try to add a

00:46:09.256 --> 00:46:11.256 A:middle
new recipe by clicking this +

00:46:11.256 --> 00:46:14.076 A:middle
button right here we get asked

00:46:14.246 --> 00:46:16.166 A:middle
to select an image for our new

00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:16.536 A:middle
recipe.

00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:18.876 A:middle
So this controller which is on

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.726 A:middle
the screen right now displays

00:46:20.786 --> 00:46:22.186 A:middle
all these images using

00:46:22.186 --> 00:46:23.046 A:middle
LazyImageView.

00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:25.346 A:middle
So just showing it up on the

00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:27.146 A:middle
screen and scrolling through the

00:46:27.146 --> 00:46:29.216 A:middle
content already exercises all of

00:46:29.216 --> 00:46:31.296 A:middle
the code inside LazyImageView,

00:46:31.506 --> 00:46:32.606 A:middle
but I don't see any crashes.

00:46:33.546 --> 00:46:34.766 A:middle
Unfortunately, it's a very

00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:35.666 A:middle
common problem with

00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:37.196 A:middle
multithreading bugs, they are

00:46:37.196 --> 00:46:38.566 A:middle
notoriously hard to reproduce.

00:46:38.566 --> 00:46:40.886 A:middle
So even when you repeatedly test

00:46:41.016 --> 00:46:43.016 A:middle
the code that has such a bug you

00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:44.326 A:middle
might not actually see a crush.

00:46:45.126 --> 00:46:46.706 A:middle
Let's try actually doing that,

00:46:46.706 --> 00:46:48.706 A:middle
let's try closing and opening

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:50.476 A:middle
this controller a couple times

00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:51.646 A:middle
and let's see if maybe

00:46:51.646 --> 00:46:53.426 A:middle
eventually we will be lucky and

00:46:53.746 --> 00:46:54.816 A:middle
we will be able to trigger this

00:46:54.816 --> 00:46:54.956 A:middle
crash.
