00:39:58.176 --> 00:40:00.436 A:middle
So it is useful to browse

00:40:00.436 --> 00:40:02.606 A:middle
through multiple crashes in the

00:40:02.606 --> 00:40:04.876 A:middle
same crash set to see if some of

00:40:04.876 --> 00:40:06.136 A:middle
them have information that is

00:40:06.136 --> 00:40:07.456 A:middle
more useful than others.

00:40:08.326 --> 00:40:11.296 A:middle
In addition, the Organizer as a

00:40:11.396 --> 00:40:13.596 A:middle
group crashes together will

00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.586 A:middle
sometimes put crashes with

00:40:15.856 --> 00:40:18.086 A:middle
different causes together in the

00:40:18.086 --> 00:40:18.916 A:middle
same group.

00:40:19.396 --> 00:40:21.466 A:middle
There may be other threads or

00:40:21.546 --> 00:40:22.936 A:middle
the backtrace of a crashed

00:40:22.936 --> 00:40:26.016 A:middle
thread that identify to you, to

00:40:26.016 --> 00:40:28.246 A:middle
a human eye you will recognize

00:40:28.246 --> 00:40:29.766 A:middle
that there are multiple causes

00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:31.956 A:middle
of this group of crashes even

00:40:31.956 --> 00:40:33.296 A:middle
though the Xcode Organizer put

00:40:33.296 --> 00:40:34.036 A:middle
them all together.

00:40:34.856 --> 00:40:36.486 A:middle
If you only looked at one crash

00:40:36.486 --> 00:40:38.686 A:middle
log you might not even know that

00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.436 A:middle
that second crash is occurring

00:40:40.826 --> 00:40:42.886 A:middle
until you fix the first one and

00:40:42.886 --> 00:40:44.896 A:middle
ship it and start getting crash

00:40:44.896 --> 00:40:45.986 A:middle
logs from your users.

00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:50.036 A:middle
Once you've done some analysis

00:40:50.036 --> 00:40:51.056 A:middle
of your crash, once you've

00:40:51.056 --> 00:40:53.416 A:middle
narrowed down where in your

00:40:53.416 --> 00:40:55.146 A:middle
process it might be occurring or

00:40:55.146 --> 00:40:56.476 A:middle
which objects it might've been

00:40:56.476 --> 00:40:58.896 A:middle
using you can use tools like the

00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.546 A:middle
Address Sanitizer and the
