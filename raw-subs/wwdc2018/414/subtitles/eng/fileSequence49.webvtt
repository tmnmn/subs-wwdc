00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:00.136 A:middle
So let's look at how it's

00:49:00.136 --> 00:49:01.826 A:middle
implemented, let's jump to

00:49:01.956 --> 00:49:03.016 A:middle
storage here which is what we're

00:49:03.016 --> 00:49:04.036 A:middle
using and let's see if it

00:49:04.036 --> 00:49:06.326 A:middle
actually is thread safe.

00:49:06.436 --> 00:49:08.466 A:middle
So here's the source of image

00:49:08.466 --> 00:49:09.656 A:middle
cache, right here at the top of

00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:11.326 A:middle
the file and we can immediately

00:49:11.326 --> 00:49:12.196 A:middle
spot what's wrong.

00:49:12.696 --> 00:49:14.306 A:middle
This is just a plain Swift

00:49:14.306 --> 00:49:16.196 A:middle
dictionary so that's not good.

00:49:16.446 --> 00:49:17.886 A:middle
Swift dictionaries are not

00:49:17.886 --> 00:49:19.156 A:middle
thread safe by default.

00:49:19.636 --> 00:49:21.586 A:middle
So if we want to share a mutable

00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:22.866 A:middle
Swift dictionary between

00:49:22.866 --> 00:49:25.146 A:middle
multiple threads we have to

00:49:25.146 --> 00:49:26.926 A:middle
protect it with synchronization,

00:49:27.476 --> 00:49:28.656 A:middle
which means we have to make sure

00:49:28.656 --> 00:49:30.336 A:middle
that only one thread accesses it

00:49:30.336 --> 00:49:30.876 A:middle
at a time.

00:49:31.846 --> 00:49:33.326 A:middle
So now let's actually work on

00:49:33.326 --> 00:49:34.656 A:middle
fixing this problem and making

00:49:34.656 --> 00:49:36.876 A:middle
the class thread safe and I'll

00:49:36.876 --> 00:49:37.806 A:middle
do that in two steps.

00:49:37.806 --> 00:49:41.186 A:middle
First, I'll refactor this code a

00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:42.836 A:middle
little bit so that we have more

00:49:42.836 --> 00:49:44.886 A:middle
control over storage and then in

00:49:44.886 --> 00:49:46.366 A:middle
a second step I will use a

00:49:46.366 --> 00:49:47.696 A:middle
dispatch queue to actually make

00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:48.696 A:middle
this class thread safe.

00:49:50.006 --> 00:49:52.106 A:middle
So first of all what I don't

00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:53.506 A:middle
like here is that storage is

00:49:53.506 --> 00:49:54.916 A:middle
declared as a public variable.

00:49:55.396 --> 00:49:56.896 A:middle
That means that potentially any

00:49:56.896 --> 00:49:58.496 A:middle
code inside my app can be

00:49:58.496 --> 00:49:58.976 A:middle
accessing it.

00:49:59.566 --> 00:50:01.056 A:middle
And it will be really hard to
