00:16:59.046 --> 00:17:01.256 A:middle
that the Swift runtime prints as

00:17:01.256 --> 00:17:03.516 A:middle
this error check fails and it

00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:05.415 A:middle
says, unexpectedly found nil

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:06.906 A:middle
while unwrapping an optional

00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:07.366 A:middle
value.

00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:10.076 A:middle
So that's good, that's

00:17:10.076 --> 00:17:12.685 A:middle
consistent with the code.

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:14.705 A:middle
We have a force unwrap operator

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
on line 26, we have an error

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:19.366 A:middle
message in the crash log that

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:20.675 A:middle
says we were unwrapping an

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:21.586 A:middle
optional value.

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:23.036 A:middle
This all makes sense as a

00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:25.116 A:middle
consistent story for what caused

00:17:25.116 --> 00:17:25.856 A:middle
this crash.

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:32.096 A:middle
So a force unwrap failure is an

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:34.166 A:middle
example of a precondition or an

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.576 A:middle
assertion in the code.

00:17:36.376 --> 00:17:38.156 A:middle
Preconditions and assertions are

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.906 A:middle
error checks that deliberately

00:17:39.906 --> 00:17:41.946 A:middle
stop the process when an error

00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:42.366 A:middle
occurs.

00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:45.116 A:middle
Some examples of this are of

00:17:45.116 --> 00:17:47.056 A:middle
course the force unwrap of an

00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:48.176 A:middle
optional that we just saw.

00:17:48.656 --> 00:17:50.596 A:middle
The Swift runtime will assert

00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:53.506 A:middle
that the optional is not nil and

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:54.386 A:middle
crash if it is.

00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:56.746 A:middle
We have out-of-bounds

00:17:56.746 --> 00:17:58.556 A:middle
Swift.Array access is another

00:17:58.596 --> 00:17:59.976 A:middle
example.

00:17:59.976 --> 00:18:02.146 A:middle
If you access an array and your
