00:56:00.396 --> 00:56:04.056 A:middle
So now let's recap what we've

00:56:04.056 --> 00:56:04.706 A:middle
learned today.

00:56:05.786 --> 00:56:07.636 A:middle
Chris has showed us how we can

00:56:07.636 --> 00:56:08.976 A:middle
and should use the Organizer

00:56:08.976 --> 00:56:10.796 A:middle
window in Xcode to get

00:56:11.126 --> 00:56:12.466 A:middle
statistics and also details

00:56:12.466 --> 00:56:13.186 A:middle
about crash logs.

00:56:14.286 --> 00:56:15.996 A:middle
Greg showed us how to read and

00:56:15.996 --> 00:56:17.926 A:middle
analyze the text of crash logs.

00:56:18.736 --> 00:56:19.756 A:middle
In many cases, they can be

00:56:19.756 --> 00:56:21.386 A:middle
reproduced like if you are

00:56:21.386 --> 00:56:22.826 A:middle
dealing with app lunch timeouts.

00:56:24.076 --> 00:56:26.716 A:middle
Then we've crash log crashes

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:27.796 A:middle
that are hard to reproduce

00:56:27.796 --> 00:56:28.966 A:middle
because they happen randomly

00:56:28.966 --> 00:56:30.096 A:middle
like memory corruptions.

00:56:30.486 --> 00:56:32.466 A:middle
And we have mentioned what signs

00:56:32.846 --> 00:56:33.936 A:middle
they leave in crash logs.

00:56:34.796 --> 00:56:36.646 A:middle
And finally, I've shown how bug

00:56:36.646 --> 00:56:37.486 A:middle
finding tools like the

00:56:37.486 --> 00:56:39.106 A:middle
Sanitizers can help you

00:56:39.106 --> 00:56:41.606 A:middle
reproduce issues that are memory

00:56:41.606 --> 00:56:42.916 A:middle
corruptions and threading issues

00:56:43.026 --> 00:56:44.116 A:middle
and I recommend that you use

00:56:44.116 --> 00:56:45.006 A:middle
these tools as well.

00:56:45.956 --> 00:56:47.576 A:middle
For more information please

00:56:47.576 --> 00:56:49.466 A:middle
visit our session's webpage

00:56:49.466 --> 00:56:51.006 A:middle
where we will also include links

00:56:51.056 --> 00:56:52.036 A:middle
to the technotes that we

00:56:52.036 --> 00:56:53.366 A:middle
mentioned and also the other

00:56:53.366 --> 00:56:54.406 A:middle
documents that provides

00:56:54.466 --> 00:56:55.966 A:middle
debugging tips that are helpful

00:56:56.196 --> 00:56:57.076 A:middle
when dealing with crashes.

00:56:57.596 --> 00:56:58.846 A:middle
And I'd like to remind you that

00:56:58.846 --> 00:57:00.166 A:middle
there is a crash logs lab
