00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:02.026 A:middle
database property was invalid.

00:35:04.446 --> 00:35:06.496 A:middle
So we haven't actually found a

00:35:06.566 --> 00:35:08.036 A:middle
bug yet, none of this code is

00:35:08.036 --> 00:35:09.706 A:middle
incorrect, the ivar destroyer

00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:11.656 A:middle
function is not wrong, something

00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:13.716 A:middle
else was buggy in our code.

00:35:14.376 --> 00:35:15.856 A:middle
But from the crash log we have

00:35:15.856 --> 00:35:17.966 A:middle
been able to narrow down where

00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:20.326 A:middle
our testing should go, where our

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.036 A:middle
attempts to reproduce the bug

00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:22.596 A:middle
should go.

00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:24.086 A:middle
We should be exercising this

00:35:24.086 --> 00:35:26.396 A:middle
class, we should be exercising

00:35:26.396 --> 00:35:27.876 A:middle
the database field, we should be

00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.176 A:middle
reading the code that uses that

00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:32.246 A:middle
database object and try and find

00:35:32.246 --> 00:35:32.616 A:middle
the bug.

00:35:32.996 --> 00:35:36.206 A:middle
So what have we just done?

00:35:37.036 --> 00:35:38.296 A:middle
We read a crash log from

00:35:38.296 --> 00:35:38.886 A:middle
scratch.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.096 A:middle
We started with the crash

00:35:40.156 --> 00:35:42.396 A:middle
reason, we read the exception

00:35:42.396 --> 00:35:43.606 A:middle
type, we understand what the

00:35:43.606 --> 00:35:44.886 A:middle
exception type means.

00:35:45.996 --> 00:35:48.656 A:middle
We examined the stack trace of

00:35:48.656 --> 00:35:49.986 A:middle
the thread that crashed,

00:35:50.246 --> 00:35:51.806 A:middle
understand what it was doing,

00:35:52.186 --> 00:35:54.146 A:middle
and what the actual error that

00:35:54.146 --> 00:35:55.126 A:middle
failed was.

00:35:55.126 --> 00:35:57.426 A:middle
And we looked for clues

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:59.466 A:middle
elsewhere in the crash log, in

00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:00.716 A:middle
this case we used the bad
