ingredients and my steps.

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:06.166 A:middle
I did a very good job, I'm very

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:07.196 A:middle
pleased with myself.

00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:10.076 A:middle
And I can go back to the

00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:12.016 A:middle
Organizer and mark this issue as

00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:13.666 A:middle
resolved, step away from the

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:15.296 A:middle

Okay so you've just see how you

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:27.256 A:middle
can use the Crashes Organizer to

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
download crash logs from

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:30.916 A:middle
TestFlight, open the log in your

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:32.616 A:middle
source code, and resolve an

00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:32.876 A:middle
issue.

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:35.546 A:middle

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.116 A:middle
Very simple, your customers if

00:09:40.116 --> 00:09:41.256 A:middle
they opt into sharing with

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:42.676 A:middle
third-party developers this just

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:43.896 A:middle
works, their crash logs are

00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:44.816 A:middle
uploaded automatically.

00:09:46.326 --> 00:09:47.966 A:middle
All you need to do is sign into

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:50.026 A:middle
Xcode with your Apple ID.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.576 A:middle
When you upload your app you

00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:53.826 A:middle
should include symbols so that

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:54.966 A:middle
you get server-side

00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:57.226 A:middle
symbolication of your crash

00:09:57.836 --> 00:09:57.976 A:middle
logs.

00:09:58.226 --> 00:09:59.926 A:middle
