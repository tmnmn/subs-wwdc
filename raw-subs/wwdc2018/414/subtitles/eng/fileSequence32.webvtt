00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:02.696 A:middle
So we see the stack trace of our

00:32:02.696 --> 00:32:04.876 A:middle
crash thread, we see the file

00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:06.036 A:middle
and line number information

00:32:06.036 --> 00:32:07.926 A:middle
where available, and now we can

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:08.526 A:middle
go to work.

00:32:09.076 --> 00:32:10.776 A:middle
Now we can find the address of

00:32:10.776 --> 00:32:13.036 A:middle
the ivar destroyer function and

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:15.306 A:middle
disassemble it.

00:32:15.476 --> 00:32:17.336 A:middle
This shows us the assembly code

00:32:17.616 --> 00:32:18.636 A:middle
of our function.

00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:21.646 A:middle
Now I don't have time to teach

00:32:21.646 --> 00:32:22.946 A:middle
you how to read assembly code,

00:32:23.436 --> 00:32:25.556 A:middle
but luckily for crash logs you

00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.846 A:middle
don't actually have to be

00:32:27.006 --> 00:32:29.436 A:middle
completely fluent in reading

00:32:29.436 --> 00:32:30.346 A:middle
assembly code.

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:32.146 A:middle
It often is sufficient to be

00:32:32.146 --> 00:32:33.996 A:middle
able to skim the assembly code

00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:35.486 A:middle
and get a general idea of what

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:37.016 A:middle
is going on, you don't have to

00:32:37.016 --> 00:32:38.286 A:middle
understand every single

00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:39.966 A:middle
instruction to be able to get

00:32:39.966 --> 00:32:41.656 A:middle
useful information out of a

00:32:41.656 --> 00:32:42.296 A:middle
crash log.

00:32:43.456 --> 00:32:45.626 A:middle
If we read through this function

00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.776 A:middle
and we know about the call

00:32:47.906 --> 00:32:50.106 A:middle
instruction and the jump

00:32:50.106 --> 00:32:51.876 A:middle
instruction which are how you

00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:54.486 A:middle
call functions, we can separate

00:32:54.486 --> 00:32:56.606 A:middle
this code into three blocks.

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:00.566 A:middle
We have this top section which
