00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
this crash log in our source

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.406 A:middle
code I can reason about what's

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:01.966 A:middle
going on.

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:03.526 A:middle
So I'm going to click the Open

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.796 A:middle
in Project button, select the

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:07.286 A:middle
project that matches build 5 of

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.126 A:middle
my app and what I do, what you

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:12.146 A:middle
can see is that this crash log

00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:13.296 A:middle
has opened up in the debug

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:15.096 A:middle
navigator as if this app has

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:15.806 A:middle
just crashed.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:17.796 A:middle
And you can see here that we're

00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:19.296 A:middle
stopped on this fatal error.

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:22.416 A:middle
So a good question to ask myself

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:23.916 A:middle
is, is this a valid use of fatal

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.106 A:middle
error, I only want to be

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:26.366 A:middle
crashing if it's absolutely

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:26.936 A:middle
necessary.

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:31.136 A:middle
So I can see that this is an

00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:33.846 A:middle
initializer of an enum from an

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:36.756 A:middle
int and that enum can only be

00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:38.886 A:middle
zero or one, if it's not I'll

00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:39.796 A:middle
hit this fatal error.

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:41.126 A:middle
So I think that this makes

00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:42.136 A:middle
sense, this should only be

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:43.796 A:middle
crashing if there's some kind of

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:45.086 A:middle
misuse by the programmer.

00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:48.856 A:middle
So I can see the caller of this

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:50.476 A:middle
initializer if I navigate up the

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:53.076 A:middle
call stack here and I can see

00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:54.396 A:middle
it's this tableView delegate

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:54.836 A:middle
method.

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.666 A:middle
This method is asking for a

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.226 A:middle
title for a header in a given

00:06:58.226 --> 00:06:58.886 A:middle
section number.

00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:00.776 A:middle
So it must be that that section
