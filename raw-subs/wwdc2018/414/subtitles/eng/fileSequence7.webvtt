00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:00.776 A:middle
So it must be that that section

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:01.996 A:middle
number is not zero or one.

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:03.636 A:middle
So I think I have a better

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:04.726 A:middle
understanding of what's going

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:06.516 A:middle
on, but let's try to reproduce

00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:08.036 A:middle
this issue in the app and see if

00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:08.736 A:middle
we can learn more.

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:11.606 A:middle
So I've hit play.

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:13.386 A:middle
And Chocolate Chip is a recipe

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:14.656 A:middle
app I store all of my favorite

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:17.246 A:middle
recipes and I've been testing

00:07:17.246 --> 00:07:18.586 A:middle
with this whipped cream recipe

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:19.996 A:middle
and you can see everything's

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.386 A:middle
fine, I can see my list of

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:22.866 A:middle
ingredients, my list of steps.

00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:23.796 A:middle
These are the two recipe

00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:25.376 A:middle
sections, that's ingredients

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:26.886 A:middle
that's section zero and steps

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:27.686 A:middle
that's section one.

00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:30.696 A:middle
And if I click on another recipe

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:33.456 A:middle
we've hit a crash and what I can

00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:35.056 A:middle
see is that we're stopped on the

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:37.296 A:middle
same fatal error and the

00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:39.016 A:middle
backtrace looks very similar to

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:40.206 A:middle
the crash log that we've been

00:07:40.206 --> 00:07:40.716 A:middle
looking at.

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:41.926 A:middle
So that's a very good sign that

00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:43.026 A:middle
we're looking at the same issue.

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:44.676 A:middle
So I'm going to clear this crash

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:47.416 A:middle
log by hitting delete and let's

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:49.096 A:middle
look at this debug session.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.006 A:middle
So in this fatal error I can see

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.626 A:middle
that the message is nicely

00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:55.166 A:middle
printing out that the section

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:55.886 A:middle
number is eight.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:56.936 A:middle
So that's the reason we're

00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:58.456 A:middle
crashing it's not zero or one.

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:00.666 A:middle
And what's occurring to me now
