00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.256 A:middle
In particular I'm going to cover

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:02.496 A:middle
the fundamentals of crashes, why

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:03.736 A:middle
do they happen, what do they

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:04.226 A:middle
look like.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.326 A:middle
Then I'm going to show you some

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:08.646 A:middle
of the tools that we have to

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:10.226 A:middle
access crash logs when they're

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:11.026 A:middle
occurring in the wild.

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:13.666 A:middle
Then Greg is going to come up

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:15.876 A:middle
and give you some more detail on

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:17.246 A:middle
how to read the content of a

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.186 A:middle
crash log.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.026 A:middle
And then he's going to go in

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:22.476 A:middle
depth in how to read a tricky

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.036 A:middle
memory issue with a crash log.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.686 A:middle
And then Kuba will show you how

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.426 A:middle
to catch threading races early,

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:29.446 A:middle
these threading races lead to

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.446 A:middle
crashes, and these crashes are

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:33.866 A:middle
very hard to reproduce.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.856 A:middle
So first we should define it,

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:37.316 A:middle
what is a crash?

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:41.206 A:middle
A crash is a sudden termination

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.406 A:middle
of your app when it attempts to

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:44.596 A:middle
do something that is not

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:44.986 A:middle
allowed.

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.296 A:middle
So what's not allowed?

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:49.386 A:middle
Well, sometimes it's impossible

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:51.626 A:middle
for the CPU to execute code, the

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:53.086 A:middle
CPU won't divide by zero.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:55.726 A:middle
Or sometimes it's the operating

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:56.976 A:middle
system that's enforcing some

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:57.516 A:middle
policy.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.216 A:middle
The operating system will
