If you access an array and your

00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:04.156 A:middle
index is out-of-bounds the Swift

00:18:04.156 --> 00:18:06.096 A:middle
runtime will fail, interim check

00:18:06.096 --> 00:18:07.866 A:middle
it will fail a precondition and

00:18:07.866 --> 00:18:08.826 A:middle
halt the process.

00:18:10.076 --> 00:18:12.126 A:middle
Swift arithmetic overflow also

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:14.106 A:middle
contains assertions, if you're

00:18:14.206 --> 00:18:15.866 A:middle
adding two numbers together and

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:17.256 A:middle
the result is too large for an

00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:18.826 A:middle
integer variable there is a

00:18:18.826 --> 00:18:20.256 A:middle
precondition for that, the

00:18:20.256 --> 00:18:22.396 A:middle
process will halt.

00:18:22.906 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
Uncaught exceptions are

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:25.936 A:middle
frequently caused by

00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:28.026 A:middle
preconditions in the code.

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.216 A:middle
There are many error checks

00:18:30.216 --> 00:18:32.386 A:middle
where if the precondition fails

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.446 A:middle
it will throw an exception and

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.036 A:middle
if the exception is not caught

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:38.046 A:middle
the uncaught exception will

00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:39.506 A:middle
cause a crash log.

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:41.926 A:middle
And of course you can write

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:43.886 A:middle
assertions and preconditions in

00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:46.336 A:middle
your own code if you have errors

00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:47.696 A:middle
that you want to crash the

00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:49.736 A:middle
process and generate a crash log

00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:50.556 A:middle
in response.

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.716 A:middle
Another example of a crash log

00:18:54.756 --> 00:18:57.046 A:middle
is a case where the operating

00:18:57.046 --> 00:18:59.416 A:middle
system kills your process from

00:18:59.446 --> 00:19:00.146 A:middle
the outside.
