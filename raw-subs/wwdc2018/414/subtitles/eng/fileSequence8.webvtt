00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:00.666 A:middle
And what's occurring to me now

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.936 A:middle
is that this is my fault, when I

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:05.026 A:middle
implemented this class I

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.246 A:middle
implemented another delegate

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:08.086 A:middle
method called numberOfSections.

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:10.696 A:middle
And numberOfSections is saying

00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:12.326 A:middle
how many headers it should look

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:14.036 A:middle
for and what I'm returning here

00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
is the number of ingredients and

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.246 A:middle
the ingredients count is eight.

00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:19.576 A:middle
But believe it or not I have a

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:21.216 A:middle
clever way to solve this.

00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:22.356 A:middle
I know what I want to be

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:24.086 A:middle
returning is the number of cases

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.186 A:middle
in this recipe section enum and

00:08:26.186 --> 00:08:28.396 A:middle
I know that in Swift 4.2 some

00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:30.736 A:middle
new functionality was added by

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:32.035 A:middle
the Swift Open Source Community,

00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:33.885 A:middle
thank you very much, a protocol

00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:35.176 A:middle
called CaseIterable.

00:08:35.726 --> 00:08:37.236 A:middle
If I have my recipe section

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:40.596 A:middle
conformed to CaseIterable I can

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:41.655 A:middle
reimplement this number of

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.956 A:middle
sections to return the count of

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:46.266 A:middle
all the cases in that recipe

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:47.186 A:middle
section enum.

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:49.876 A:middle
And that way what I'll be

00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:51.876 A:middle
returning is two, I'll be

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:53.376 A:middle
returning the number of accurate

00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:53.956 A:middle
sections.

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:55.626 A:middle
This is going to work out just

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:56.886 A:middle
great.

00:08:57.056 --> 00:08:59.226 A:middle
So now if I check out this

00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:00.986 A:middle
chocolate chip cookies recipe no
