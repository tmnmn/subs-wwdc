00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.476 A:middle
Analytics Data you can see all

00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:02.516 A:middle
of the logs that are saved to

00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:04.556 A:middle
disk and your users can share a

00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:08.506 A:middle
log directly from this screen.

00:11:08.696 --> 00:11:11.246 A:middle
Okay so to ensure that

00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:13.106 A:middle
symbolication just works I have

00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:14.766 A:middle
three important best practices

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:15.066 A:middle
for you.

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:18.816 A:middle
Number one, if you use the

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.806 A:middle
Crashes Organizer upload your

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:21.866 A:middle
symbols with your app.

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:23.906 A:middle
This is the default, this will

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:25.036 A:middle
ensure that server-side

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.166 A:middle
symbolication works, it's very

00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:27.826 A:middle
easy.

00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:31.656 A:middle
Number two, be sure to save your

00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:32.546 A:middle
app archives.

00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.956 A:middle
Your archive contains a copy of

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:37.736 A:middle
your debug symbols, your .

00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:39.576 A:middle
Xcode uses Spotlight to find

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:41.236 A:middle
these dSYMs and to perform local

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:42.426 A:middle
symbolication when it's

00:11:42.426 --> 00:11:43.486 A:middle
necessary automatically.

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:47.526 A:middle
And if you upload an app that

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:49.906 A:middle
contains bitcode you should use

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.706 A:middle
the Archives Organizer Download

00:11:51.706 --> 00:11:53.916 A:middle
Debug Symbols button to download

00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:55.376 A:middle
any dSYMs that come from a

00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:56.916 A:middle
store-side bitcode compilation.

00:11:57.476 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
Okay we've covered all the tools
