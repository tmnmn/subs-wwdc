00:20:58.446 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
operating system sent the signal

00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
in the crash log.

00:21:01.396 --> 00:21:02.656 A:middle
In this case we have a

00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:04.626 A:middle
termination reason with a code

00:21:04.676 --> 00:21:05.966 A:middle
ate bad food.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:08.126 A:middle
If you look in the developer

00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:09.986 A:middle
technote I mentioned earlier, it

00:21:09.986 --> 00:21:11.976 A:middle
will describe what ate bad food

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:12.566 A:middle
means.

00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:14.186 A:middle
And we have a textual

00:21:14.186 --> 00:21:16.506 A:middle
description that says exhausted

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:18.596 A:middle
real clock time allowance of

00:21:18.656 --> 00:21:20.506 A:middle
19.95 seconds.

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.276 A:middle
So if we combine this

00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:23.936 A:middle
information with the information

00:21:23.936 --> 00:21:25.416 A:middle
in the technote it will tell us

00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:28.526 A:middle
our application took too long to

00:21:28.526 --> 00:21:29.076 A:middle
launch.

00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:31.546 A:middle
We had 20 seconds to launch, we

00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:32.966 A:middle
weren't done in that much time,

00:21:33.386 --> 00:21:34.606 A:middle
the operating system killed the

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:35.266 A:middle
process.

00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:38.916 A:middle
Below we can see the crash logs

00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:40.716 A:middle
at the time the process died.

00:21:41.256 --> 00:21:42.826 A:middle
It's possible that those crash

00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:44.626 A:middle
logs were the code that took too

00:21:44.626 --> 00:21:45.946 A:middle
long, maybe were stuck in an

00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:48.426 A:middle
infinite loop, maybe were stuck

00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:49.896 A:middle
waiting for network I/O and

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:51.006 A:middle
that's why we took too long to

00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:51.506 A:middle
launch.

00:21:52.296 --> 00:21:54.026 A:middle
Or on the other hand, maybe this

00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:55.916 A:middle
code is innocent and there's

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:57.426 A:middle
something earlier in the launch

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.076 A:middle
process that was too slow and

00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:00.466 A:middle
that's why the process died.
