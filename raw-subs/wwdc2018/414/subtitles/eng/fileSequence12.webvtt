00:11:57.476 --> 00:12:01.416 A:middle
Okay we've covered all the tools

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.876 A:middle
that we offer for accessing

00:12:02.876 --> 00:12:04.106 A:middle
crash logs when they occur in

00:12:04.106 --> 00:12:04.506 A:middle
the field.

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:06.346 A:middle
Now to give you an in-depth

00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:07.916 A:middle
guide into reading the content

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:09.716 A:middle
of a crash log please give a

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:10.836 A:middle
warm welcome to the helping,

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:11.936 A:middle
friendly Greg Parker.

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:17.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:18.056 --> 00:12:18.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chris.

00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.936 A:middle
So we've just seen how you can

00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:23.986 A:middle
use Xcode to find crashes and to

00:12:23.986 --> 00:12:26.356 A:middle
examine them in the Xcode tools

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:27.086 A:middle
in the debugger.

00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:30.336 A:middle
But the crash log file contains

00:12:30.336 --> 00:12:32.276 A:middle
more information, it contains

00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:33.806 A:middle
much more information than just

00:12:33.806 --> 00:12:34.666 A:middle
the stack trace.

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:37.306 A:middle
It is frequently useful to look

00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:39.096 A:middle
at that extra information in

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:40.466 A:middle
order to debug your problem.

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:43.626 A:middle
So how can you get the full text

00:12:43.626 --> 00:12:44.396 A:middle
of a crash log?

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:47.166 A:middle
Here's our Xcode Organizer, if

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.186 A:middle
we bring up the contextual menu

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.096 A:middle
there's a Show In Finder button.

00:12:51.916 --> 00:12:53.216 A:middle
The Show In Finder button will

00:12:53.216 --> 00:12:54.816 A:middle
bring up a text file which we

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.526 A:middle
can open up in the Console app

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.706 A:middle
or your favorite text editor, it

00:12:58.706 --> 00:12:59.996 A:middle
looks something like this.
