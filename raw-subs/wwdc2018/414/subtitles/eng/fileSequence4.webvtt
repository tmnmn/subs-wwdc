00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
access these crash logs.

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.416 A:middle
I'd like first to talk about how

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:03.926 A:middle
you can access those crash logs

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.156 A:middle
from your beta testers on

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.976 A:middle
TestFlight and your customers on

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:07.476 A:middle
the App Store.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.326 A:middle
You can download these crash

00:04:10.326 --> 00:04:12.196 A:middle
logs using a feature in Xcode

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:14.116 A:middle
called the Crashes Organizer,

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.896 A:middle
this is what it looks like a

00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:16.786 A:middle
beautiful dark mode.

00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:19.226 A:middle
And let's take a tour through

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:19.546 A:middle
this UI.

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:22.816 A:middle
On the left, you can see all of

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:24.336 A:middle
your apps distributed over

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:25.756 A:middle
TestFlight and the App Store and

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:27.676 A:middle
we support all of our platforms

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:29.796 A:middle
including watchOS and app

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:30.366 A:middle
extensions.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:33.586 A:middle
On the right, for a given crash

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:35.266 A:middle
point you can see the number of

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:38.196 A:middle
unique devices affected and we

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.956 A:middle
group crash logs by similar

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:41.886 A:middle
issue, by similar crash point

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:43.536 A:middle
and we rank them in the source

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:44.756 A:middle
list by the number of unique

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:45.596 A:middle
devices affected.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:48.056 A:middle
And you can page through a

00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:49.626 A:middle
sampling of the individual logs

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:50.536 A:middle
down below.

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:52.596 A:middle
And when you click on this

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:55.006 A:middle
button you can open the crash

00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:56.546 A:middle
log in your project, in the

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.826 A:middle
debug navigator and see it

00:04:57.826 --> 00:04:59.076 A:middle
alongside your source code.

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.216 A:middle
This is very cool if you haven't
