00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:02.576 A:middle
So what's in this file, let's

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:03.116 A:middle
take a look.

00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:05.506 A:middle
The top of the file starts with

00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:07.866 A:middle
some summary information, this

00:13:07.866 --> 00:13:09.496 A:middle
contains your app name, the

00:13:09.496 --> 00:13:11.646 A:middle
version number, the operating

00:13:11.646 --> 00:13:13.096 A:middle
system version it was running

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:14.846 A:middle
on, and the date and time of the

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:15.386 A:middle
crash.

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:18.496 A:middle
Below that we have the reason

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:19.416 A:middle
for the crash.

00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:21.706 A:middle
This was the specific error, the

00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:23.436 A:middle
specific signal that the

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.186 A:middle
operating system sent to kill

00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:25.936 A:middle
the process.

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:29.856 A:middle
We can also see some logging

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:30.856 A:middle
information, the

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:33.016 A:middle
application-specific information

00:13:33.056 --> 00:13:33.626 A:middle
section.

00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:35.486 A:middle
This section will include

00:13:35.486 --> 00:13:38.146 A:middle
console logs in some cases, if

00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:39.786 A:middle
you have an unhandled exception

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.056 A:middle
it may include the exception

00:13:41.056 --> 00:13:41.816 A:middle
backtrace.

00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:44.536 A:middle
This section is not always

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:47.746 A:middle
available, on iOS devices it is

00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:49.516 A:middle
often hidden for personal

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:50.706 A:middle
privacy reasons.

00:13:51.146 --> 00:13:53.296 A:middle
But on Simulator to macOS this

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:55.226 A:middle
section can include information

00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:55.766 A:middle
that is useful.

00:13:57.556 --> 00:13:58.906 A:middle
Below that we have the thread

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:00.306 A:middle
stacks, these were the
