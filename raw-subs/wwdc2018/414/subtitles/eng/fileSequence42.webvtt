00:41:59.866 --> 00:42:01.296 A:middle
cause crashes once in a while,

00:42:01.546 --> 00:42:03.506 A:middle
so your code might seem to work

00:42:03.506 --> 00:42:05.546 A:middle
fine in 99% of cases.

00:42:06.016 --> 00:42:08.056 A:middle
And these bugs can go unnoticed

00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:10.146 A:middle
for a very long time.

00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:12.996 A:middle
Often monitoring bugs cause

00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:14.446 A:middle
memory corruptions and what

00:42:14.446 --> 00:42:16.076 A:middle
you'll see in crash logs looks

00:42:16.076 --> 00:42:17.506 A:middle
just like memory corruptions as

00:42:17.506 --> 00:42:19.676 A:middle
well and we've seen examples of

00:42:19.676 --> 00:42:20.856 A:middle
those in the previous section.

00:42:21.316 --> 00:42:22.186 A:middle
So when you're dealing with

00:42:22.186 --> 00:42:23.706 A:middle
crashes inside the malloc or

00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:25.516 A:middle
free or retained counting

00:42:25.516 --> 00:42:27.466 A:middle
operations those are typical

00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:29.176 A:middle
symptoms of memory corruptions.

00:42:30.556 --> 00:42:31.966 A:middle
There's specific symptoms of

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:32.996 A:middle
multithreading bugs as well.

00:42:33.916 --> 00:42:35.546 A:middle
The crashing thread often

00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:37.566 A:middle
contains, sorry the crash log

00:42:37.566 --> 00:42:39.136 A:middle
often contains multiple threads

00:42:39.576 --> 00:42:41.416 A:middle
that are executing related parts

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:41.956 A:middle
of your code.

00:42:42.436 --> 00:42:44.046 A:middle
So if a particular class or a

00:42:44.046 --> 00:42:45.996 A:middle
method shows up in a crash log

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:48.006 A:middle
in multiple threads that's an

00:42:48.006 --> 00:42:49.256 A:middle
indication of a potential

00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:50.136 A:middle
multithreading bug.

00:42:51.646 --> 00:42:53.576 A:middle
The memory corruptions that are

00:42:53.576 --> 00:42:55.036 A:middle
caused by multithreading issues

00:42:55.186 --> 00:42:56.436 A:middle
are often very random.

00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:58.486 A:middle
So you might see crashes

00:42:58.486 --> 00:43:00.016 A:middle
happening at slightly different
