00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:01.226 A:middle
We start again with the

00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:02.716 A:middle
exception type.

00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:06.086 A:middle
This is an EXC bad access

00:24:06.086 --> 00:24:09.096 A:middle
exception, the SEG violation

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:09.606 A:middle
signal.

00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:12.306 A:middle
This is typically caused by a

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:13.266 A:middle
memory error.

00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:15.396 A:middle
The bad access exception means

00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:17.666 A:middle
one of two things, either we

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.586 A:middle
were writing to memory that is

00:24:19.586 --> 00:24:21.896 A:middle
read-only or we were reading

00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:23.436 A:middle
from memory that does not exist

00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:23.896 A:middle
at all.

00:24:24.106 --> 00:24:25.936 A:middle
Either of those will cause a bad

00:24:25.936 --> 00:24:27.976 A:middle
access exception and the process

00:24:27.976 --> 00:24:28.516 A:middle
will stop.

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:32.256 A:middle
We see here the address that we

00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:34.256 A:middle
were accessing at the time of

00:24:35.076 --> 00:24:36.366 A:middle
the crash.

00:24:36.626 --> 00:24:38.416 A:middle
We can look at the stack trace,

00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:39.346 A:middle
this is the function that

00:24:39.346 --> 00:24:40.946 A:middle
performed the bad access of

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:41.376 A:middle
course.

00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:43.736 A:middle
This is the objc release

00:24:43.736 --> 00:24:45.286 A:middle
function, it's part of the

00:24:45.286 --> 00:24:47.106 A:middle
implementation of reference

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:49.316 A:middle
counting in Objective-C and some

00:24:49.316 --> 00:24:50.386 A:middle
Swift objects.

00:24:50.946 --> 00:24:52.836 A:middle
So that again sounds like it's

00:24:52.836 --> 00:24:54.456 A:middle
likely to have been a memory

00:24:54.456 --> 00:24:55.646 A:middle
error that caused the bug.

00:24:57.126 --> 00:24:59.856 A:middle
So what code caused objc

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
release?
