00:42:58.486 --> 00:43:00.016 A:middle
happening at slightly different

00:43:00.096 --> 00:43:01.606 A:middle
lines of code or slightly

00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:02.406 A:middle
different addresses.

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:04.556 A:middle
And as Greg mentioned, you can

00:43:04.556 --> 00:43:06.956 A:middle
see those show up as different

00:43:07.946 --> 00:43:09.716 A:middle
crash points in Xcode even

00:43:09.716 --> 00:43:10.746 A:middle
though it's the same bug.

00:43:12.086 --> 00:43:13.696 A:middle
And also the crashing thread

00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:14.836 A:middle
might not actually be the

00:43:14.836 --> 00:43:15.966 A:middle
culprit of the bug, so it's

00:43:15.966 --> 00:43:18.016 A:middle
important to look at the stack

00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:19.406 A:middle
traces of the other threads in a

00:43:19.406 --> 00:43:19.856 A:middle
crash log.

00:43:20.546 --> 00:43:22.286 A:middle
So now let's take a closer look

00:43:22.376 --> 00:43:23.436 A:middle
at an example of a

00:43:23.436 --> 00:43:24.746 A:middle
multithreading bug and I will

00:43:24.746 --> 00:43:26.056 A:middle
show you how we can diagnose

00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:27.856 A:middle
such a bug using a tool called

00:43:27.856 --> 00:43:29.296 A:middle
Thread Sanitizer which is part

00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:29.886 A:middle
of Xcode.

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:40.066 A:middle
So let's take another look at

00:43:40.066 --> 00:43:41.716 A:middle
our cookies recipe app that

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:43.416 A:middle
Chris and I made and let's look

00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:44.766 A:middle
at some more crash logs that we

00:43:44.766 --> 00:43:46.066 A:middle
received from our users.

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.116 A:middle
Let's focus on this second app

00:43:49.116 --> 00:43:50.546 A:middle
crasher of our app, this one.

00:43:52.066 --> 00:43:53.476 A:middle
This crash log indicates that

00:43:53.476 --> 00:43:54.746 A:middle
there's something wrong going on

00:43:54.746 --> 00:43:56.256 A:middle
when we're doing with a class

00:43:56.256 --> 00:43:58.066 A:middle
called LazyImageView, which is a

00:43:58.066 --> 00:43:59.836 A:middle
class that I wrote and we'll

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:00.996 A:middle
look at it in just a second.
