00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
device of course, test outside

00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:02.376 A:middle
of Simulators.

00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:06.096 A:middle
And test your devices with older

00:23:06.096 --> 00:23:08.026 A:middle
hardware, whatever's the oldest

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.826 A:middle
hardware you want your app to

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:10.386 A:middle
support.

00:23:11.026 --> 00:23:12.636 A:middle
If you test only on newer

00:23:12.636 --> 00:23:14.076 A:middle
hardware you might find that

00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:16.236 A:middle
your app launches fast enough on

00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:18.636 A:middle
a faster device, but slower

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:20.306 A:middle
devices might take too much

00:23:20.306 --> 00:23:20.646 A:middle
time.

00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:25.296 A:middle
So let's talk about another

00:23:25.296 --> 00:23:27.326 A:middle
class of errors, let's talk

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:28.836 A:middle
about memory errors and what

00:23:28.836 --> 00:23:31.116 A:middle
they look like in crash logs.

00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:34.306 A:middle
When I say memory error I mean

00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:37.076 A:middle
cases like reference counting of

00:23:37.076 --> 00:23:40.576 A:middle
an object being over-released or

00:23:40.726 --> 00:23:42.446 A:middle
using an object after it has

00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:45.936 A:middle
been freed or a buffer overflow

00:23:45.936 --> 00:23:48.286 A:middle
where you have a byte array or

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:50.476 A:middle
another C array and you access

00:23:50.476 --> 00:23:51.926 A:middle
that array out-of-bounds.

00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:55.316 A:middle
So let's look at another crash

00:23:55.316 --> 00:23:57.926 A:middle
log and spoiler alert this one

00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:58.746 A:middle
is a memory error.

00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:01.226 A:middle
We start again with the
