00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.216 A:middle
This is very cool if you haven't

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.756 A:middle
seen it before, we'll see that

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:02.426 A:middle
in a bit.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:04.456 A:middle
And in the detailed view of

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:05.686 A:middle
course we show you a fully

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:07.636 A:middle
symbolicated backtrace with the

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:08.606 A:middle
crash point highlighted.

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:10.496 A:middle
So now that we have the lay of

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:12.286 A:middle
the land let's play with it.

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:16.866 A:middle
So I have Xcode open here and

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:18.096 A:middle
I'm going to open up the

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:21.396 A:middle
Organizer window and you can see

00:05:21.396 --> 00:05:22.716 A:middle
that I've selected the Crashes

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.096 A:middle
tab, that's the second tab here

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.276 A:middle
and I've selected this chocolate

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:27.516 A:middle
chip app that Kuba and I are

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:28.086 A:middle
working on.

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:31.516 A:middle
And I've uploaded this build to

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:32.916 A:middle
TestFlight and you can see I'm

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.256 A:middle
looking at build 5 right now and

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
a number of testers are

00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:38.046 A:middle
reporting crashes, so that's not

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:38.566 A:middle
too good.

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:39.756 A:middle
But I've worked on a couple of

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.766 A:middle
these crashes you can see, but

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:42.996 A:middle
this first one I haven't worked

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:44.296 A:middle
on yet so let's try to resolve

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:45.246 A:middle
that.

00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:48.746 A:middle
So this is affecting 242 devices

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:50.446 A:middle
and I can see the backtrace that

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:51.846 A:middle
was captured from the time that

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.136 A:middle
the app crashed and the crash

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:53.956 A:middle
point highlighted.

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:55.976 A:middle
Now I'm not quite sure what's

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.136 A:middle
going on yet but I bet if I open

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
this crash log in our source
