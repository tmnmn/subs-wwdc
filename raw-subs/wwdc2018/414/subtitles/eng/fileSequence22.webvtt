00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:00.466 A:middle
that's why the process died.

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:06.366 A:middle
So launch timeouts, how can you

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
avoid them.

00:22:07.306 --> 00:22:08.716 A:middle
We want you to avoid them,

00:22:08.816 --> 00:22:10.626 A:middle
launch timeouts are a common

00:22:10.626 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
reason for app rejection during

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.536 A:middle
Apple's app review.

00:22:15.756 --> 00:22:17.256 A:middle
So how do you avoid this?

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:19.516 A:middle
Well test your app of course.

00:22:19.626 --> 00:22:23.316 A:middle
But there's a catch, the launch

00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:26.016 A:middle
timeout watchdog is disabled in

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:27.986 A:middle
the Simulator and it's disabled

00:22:27.986 --> 00:22:29.586 A:middle
in the debugger so if you're

00:22:29.586 --> 00:22:30.766 A:middle
doing all your testing in the

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.076 A:middle
Simulator and the debugger

00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:33.356 A:middle
you'll never see watchdog

00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:33.976 A:middle
timeouts.

00:22:35.206 --> 00:22:37.596 A:middle
So when you test your app be

00:22:37.596 --> 00:22:39.336 A:middle
sure to test without the

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:39.906 A:middle
debugger.

00:22:40.346 --> 00:22:42.416 A:middle
If you're a macOS app launch

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.406 A:middle
your app in the Finder.

00:22:43.786 --> 00:22:46.456 A:middle
If you're an iOS app run in

00:22:46.456 --> 00:22:48.776 A:middle
TestFlight or launch your app

00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:50.726 A:middle
using the iOS App Launcher.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:52.656 A:middle
All of these will run your app

00:22:52.656 --> 00:22:54.526 A:middle
outside the debugger and the

00:22:54.526 --> 00:22:56.286 A:middle
launch timeouts will be enabled

00:22:56.286 --> 00:22:57.026 A:middle
and enforced.

00:22:58.426 --> 00:22:59.966 A:middle
When you test, test on a real

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
device of course, test outside
