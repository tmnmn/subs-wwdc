00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.226 A:middle
after the function call.

00:34:00.886 --> 00:34:02.146 A:middle
So the instruction of the called

00:34:02.146 --> 00:34:04.346 A:middle
objc release was the previous

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.436 A:middle
instruction, it's this

00:34:05.436 --> 00:34:05.986 A:middle
instruction.

00:34:06.916 --> 00:34:09.786 A:middle
If we read this it's the call of

00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.815 A:middle
objc release which is good,

00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:13.746 A:middle
that's consistent with what we

00:34:13.746 --> 00:34:15.286 A:middle
saw in the stack trace in the

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:16.755 A:middle
crash log which was a call to

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:19.295 A:middle
objc release at this offset.

00:34:20.156 --> 00:34:22.606 A:middle
And this release function is

00:34:22.606 --> 00:34:24.916 A:middle
releasing the database property.

00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:28.085 A:middle
So now we have more detail about

00:34:28.085 --> 00:34:29.146 A:middle
what our crash is doing.

00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:31.295 A:middle
We released the username

00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:32.396 A:middle
property and that was

00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:33.056 A:middle
successful.

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:35.596 A:middle
We have not yet gotten to the

00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:37.366 A:middle
views property, it might be

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.896 A:middle
valid, it might be invalid we

00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:39.416 A:middle
don't know.

00:34:39.866 --> 00:34:41.966 A:middle
What we do know is we tried to

00:34:41.966 --> 00:34:43.696 A:middle
release the database property

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:46.206 A:middle
and that object looked like it

00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:49.186 A:middle
was already freed object based

00:34:49.186 --> 00:34:50.676 A:middle
on the malloc free list pointer

00:34:50.676 --> 00:34:51.156 A:middle
signature.

00:34:52.315 --> 00:34:53.456 A:middle
So that gives us a pretty good

00:34:53.456 --> 00:34:55.416 A:middle
story of what caused this crash.

00:34:56.025 --> 00:34:57.936 A:middle
We were freeing a login view

00:34:57.936 --> 00:34:59.996 A:middle
controller object and the

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:02.026 A:middle
database property was invalid.
