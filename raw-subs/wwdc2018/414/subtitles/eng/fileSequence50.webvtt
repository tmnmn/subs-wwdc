00:49:59.566 --> 00:50:01.056 A:middle
And it will be really hard to

00:50:01.056 --> 00:50:02.246 A:middle
make sure that all the code in

00:50:02.246 --> 00:50:04.466 A:middle
my app does it correctly, so

00:50:04.466 --> 00:50:06.316 A:middle
let's change it to private

00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:06.686 A:middle
instead.

00:50:07.116 --> 00:50:09.536 A:middle
And let me introduce a different

00:50:09.536 --> 00:50:11.726 A:middle
way of accessing image cache and

00:50:11.726 --> 00:50:13.536 A:middle
I'll do that by introducing a

00:50:13.536 --> 00:50:14.076 A:middle
subscript.

00:50:15.206 --> 00:50:16.806 A:middle
That means that users of image

00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:19.056 A:middle
cache can use brackets to load

00:50:19.056 --> 00:50:20.236 A:middle
and store data from the cache.

00:50:21.596 --> 00:50:24.546 A:middle
So subscripting needs a getter,

00:50:25.846 --> 00:50:27.086 A:middle
like this one and a setter.

00:50:28.446 --> 00:50:30.016 A:middle
And for now let's just implement

00:50:30.016 --> 00:50:31.986 A:middle
these by directly accessing the

00:50:31.986 --> 00:50:32.896 A:middle
underlying storage.

00:50:34.586 --> 00:50:36.206 A:middle
And to make the rest of this

00:50:36.456 --> 00:50:37.936 A:middle
file actually build I need to

00:50:37.936 --> 00:50:39.976 A:middle
update the users, so instead of

00:50:40.456 --> 00:50:41.876 A:middle
accessing the storage property

00:50:42.056 --> 00:50:43.646 A:middle
we should be using brackets and

00:50:43.646 --> 00:50:45.526 A:middle
index into image cache directly

00:50:46.226 --> 00:50:47.216 A:middle
like this.

00:50:47.436 --> 00:50:49.886 A:middle
So if I hit Build Now you'll see

00:50:49.886 --> 00:50:52.176 A:middle
that the code will compile fine

00:50:52.176 --> 00:50:53.586 A:middle
now, but I didn't really fix any

00:50:53.586 --> 00:50:54.176 A:middle
bugs yet.

00:50:55.006 --> 00:50:56.716 A:middle
But I did achieve something, I

00:50:56.716 --> 00:50:59.276 A:middle
now have direct control over all

00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:00.476 A:middle
the code that can access
