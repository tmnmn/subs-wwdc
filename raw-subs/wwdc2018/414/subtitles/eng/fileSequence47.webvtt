00:47:00.176 --> 00:47:01.976 A:middle
All right here we go, the

00:47:01.976 --> 00:47:04.406 A:middle
debugger has stopped because it

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:05.936 A:middle
has crashed, but even when you

00:47:05.936 --> 00:47:07.806 A:middle
actually do catch this crash in

00:47:07.806 --> 00:47:08.826 A:middle
the debugger it doesn't really

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:09.806 A:middle
help us.

00:47:10.256 --> 00:47:11.536 A:middle
All the debugger provides is

00:47:11.536 --> 00:47:13.636 A:middle
that this is some sort of XC bad

00:47:13.636 --> 00:47:15.906 A:middle
excess but it does not what

00:47:15.906 --> 00:47:17.646 A:middle
caused the corruption or why did

00:47:17.646 --> 00:47:19.036 A:middle
it actually happen.

00:47:19.806 --> 00:47:21.866 A:middle
Luckily Xcode has a tool that's

00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:23.356 A:middle
perfect just for this situation

00:47:23.356 --> 00:47:24.616 A:middle
and it's called Thread Sanitizer

00:47:24.616 --> 00:47:25.676 A:middle
and that's what I'm going to use

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:25.876 A:middle
here.

00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:27.816 A:middle
So let's open up the scheme

00:47:27.816 --> 00:47:29.206 A:middle
editor of our project which I

00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:30.446 A:middle
can do by clicking the name of

00:47:30.446 --> 00:47:32.066 A:middle
our app here and choosing Edit

00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:32.426 A:middle
Scheme.

00:47:33.336 --> 00:47:35.536 A:middle
And if I then switch over to the

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.576 A:middle
tab called Diagnostics you'll

00:47:37.576 --> 00:47:40.006 A:middle
see that we have several runtime

00:47:40.006 --> 00:47:41.426 A:middle
diagnostic tools here, like

00:47:41.426 --> 00:47:42.676 A:middle
Address Sanitizer which is great

00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.136 A:middle
at finding buffer overflows.

00:47:45.486 --> 00:47:46.746 A:middle
Let me choose Thread Sanitizer

00:47:46.746 --> 00:47:48.396 A:middle
and I'll also select Pause on

00:47:48.396 --> 00:47:49.876 A:middle
Issues which means that the

00:47:49.876 --> 00:47:51.206 A:middle
debugger will break every time

00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:52.826 A:middle
that Sanitizer detects a bug.

00:47:54.636 --> 00:47:56.086 A:middle
Let's run the app in the

00:47:56.086 --> 00:47:57.556 A:middle
Simulator with Thread Sanitizer

00:47:57.556 --> 00:47:58.566 A:middle
enabled and let's see what

00:47:58.566 --> 00:48:00.366 A:middle
happens now if I try to add a
