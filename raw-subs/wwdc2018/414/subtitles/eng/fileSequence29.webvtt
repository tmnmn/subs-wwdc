00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:00.056 A:middle
release at this point in the

00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:01.656 A:middle
code has already been

00:29:01.656 --> 00:29:03.606 A:middle
deallocated, that's the memory

00:29:03.606 --> 00:29:04.486 A:middle
error that occurred.

00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:08.006 A:middle
So that's additional detail of

00:29:08.186 --> 00:29:09.496 A:middle
what our story is.

00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:10.476 A:middle
We have our object being

00:29:10.476 --> 00:29:12.336 A:middle
deallocated, we're cleaning up

00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:14.916 A:middle
its ivars, one of those ivars

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:17.116 A:middle
was already a freed object and

00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:18.266 A:middle
that's what caused our crash.

00:29:19.506 --> 00:29:20.566 A:middle
Can we do better?

00:29:20.566 --> 00:29:23.736 A:middle
Can we figure out which object

00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.876 A:middle
was being released by objc

00:29:25.876 --> 00:29:26.566 A:middle
release?

00:29:27.636 --> 00:29:29.806 A:middle
Ordinarily, the function calling

00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:31.276 A:middle
objc release would give us a

00:29:31.326 --> 00:29:32.926 A:middle
clue as to what that was.

00:29:33.516 --> 00:29:35.166 A:middle
But the problem with the ivar

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:37.186 A:middle
destroyer function is it is a

00:29:37.186 --> 00:29:39.306 A:middle
compiler generated function.

00:29:39.876 --> 00:29:41.016 A:middle
We didn't write a function

00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:42.826 A:middle
called ivar destroyer, which

00:29:42.826 --> 00:29:44.476 A:middle
means there's no filename or

00:29:44.476 --> 00:29:46.816 A:middle
line number associated with this

00:29:46.816 --> 00:29:48.006 A:middle
point in the crash, we don't

00:29:48.006 --> 00:29:50.436 A:middle
know which of our properties was

00:29:50.436 --> 00:29:52.346 A:middle
being deallocated at that point.

00:29:53.326 --> 00:29:55.156 A:middle
Here's our class, we have three

00:29:55.156 --> 00:29:56.696 A:middle
properties in this class, we

00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:58.916 A:middle
have a username, a database, and

00:29:58.916 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
an array of views.
