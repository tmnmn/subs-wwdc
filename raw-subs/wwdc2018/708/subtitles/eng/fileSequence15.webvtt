Part 2 that is going to cover

00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:02.766 A:middle
quantization with Core ML Tools

00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:02.976 A:middle
in detail.

00:15:04.126 --> 00:15:05.396 A:middle
So I want to focus first on the

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.856 A:middle
Glass style and see how the

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:09.416 A:middle
different quantization versions

00:15:09.696 --> 00:15:10.746 A:middle
work for these styles.

00:15:11.836 --> 00:15:13.646 A:middle
So all I have to do is drag

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.076 A:middle
these new models inside the

00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:17.756 A:middle
Xcode project, and rerun the

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:17.943 A:middle
app.

00:15:18.046 --> 00:15:19.976 A:middle
And then we are going to see how

00:15:19.976 --> 00:15:20.806 A:middle
these models behave.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.986 A:middle
First we can see that the size

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.856 A:middle
has been greatly reduced.

00:15:25.856 --> 00:15:27.906 A:middle
For example, the 8-bit version

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:29.906 A:middle
already from 6 or 7 megabytes

00:15:29.906 --> 00:15:30.976 A:middle
went down to just 1.7.

00:15:31.516 --> 00:15:36.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:39.226 A:middle
In 4-bit, we can save even more,

00:15:39.226 --> 00:15:40.876 A:middle
and now the model is less than 1

00:15:40.876 --> 00:15:41.336 A:middle
megabyte.

00:15:41.936 --> 00:15:43.286 A:middle
In 3-bit, it is -- that's even

00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:44.956 A:middle
smaller, at 49 kilobytes.

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:45.946 A:middle
And so on.

00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:49.326 A:middle
Now let's go back to the app.

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:52.616 A:middle
Let's make this same image for

00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:54.486 A:middle
reference and apply the Glass

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.276 A:middle
style in the original version.

00:15:57.136 --> 00:15:58.266 A:middle
Still looks as before.

00:15:59.016 --> 00:16:00.676 A:middle
Now we can compare it with the
