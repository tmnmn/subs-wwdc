00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:01.216 A:middle
more features to your app, your

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:02.806 A:middle
app size might simply become out

00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:03.286 A:middle
of control.

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:05.756 A:middle
So that's the first thing that

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:06.666 A:middle
you can do about it.

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:08.736 A:middle
And if these machine-learning

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:10.076 A:middle
models are supporting other

00:06:10.116 --> 00:06:11.946 A:middle
features to your app, you can

00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:13.506 A:middle
keep them outside your initial

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:13.956 A:middle
bundle.

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:17.196 A:middle
And then as the user uses the

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:18.666 A:middle
other features, you can download

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:20.546 A:middle
them on demand, compile them on

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.036 A:middle
device.

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:23.036 A:middle
So this -- in this case, this

00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:24.356 A:middle
user is happy in the beginning

00:06:24.356 --> 00:06:26.166 A:middle
because the installation size is

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:26.746 A:middle
unchanged.

00:06:27.246 --> 00:06:28.956 A:middle
But since the user downloads and

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.106 A:middle
uses all the current Core ML

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:32.156 A:middle
functionality in your app, at

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:33.406 A:middle
the end of the day the size of

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:34.786 A:middle
the -- of your app is still

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:35.046 A:middle
large.

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:38.096 A:middle
So wouldn't it be better if,

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.766 A:middle
instead, we could tackle this

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:43.646 A:middle
problem by reducing the size of

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:44.616 A:middle
the models itself?

00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:47.496 A:middle
This would give us a smaller

00:06:47.496 --> 00:06:48.886 A:middle
bundle in case we ship the

00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:51.716 A:middle
models inside the app, faster

00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:54.026 A:middle
and smaller downloads if instead

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:55.346 A:middle
of shipping the models in the

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:56.206 A:middle
app we download them.

00:06:56.206 --> 00:06:58.936 A:middle
And in any case, your app will

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.406 A:middle
enjoy a lower memory footprint.
