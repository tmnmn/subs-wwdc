00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
quantized model and compare it

00:13:00.786 --> 00:13:02.396 A:middle
with the referenced

00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:04.186 A:middle
floating-point version for

00:13:04.186 --> 00:13:05.586 A:middle
relevant this data and form

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.076 A:middle
metrics that are valid for your

00:13:07.076 --> 00:13:07.876 A:middle
app and use case.

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:10.786 A:middle
Now let's see a demo of how we

00:13:10.786 --> 00:13:13.586 A:middle
can use -- adopt quantized

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:14.796 A:middle
models to reduce the size of an

00:13:14.796 --> 00:13:14.936 A:middle
app.

00:13:15.516 --> 00:13:18.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:26.556 A:middle
I would like to show you a style

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.566 A:middle
transfer app.

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:29.416 A:middle
In style transfer, a neural

00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.356 A:middle
network has been trained to

00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:33.456 A:middle
render user images using styles

00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:34.326 A:middle
that have been learned by

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:35.646 A:middle
watching paintings or other

00:13:35.646 --> 00:13:36.086 A:middle
images.

00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:37.616 A:middle
So let me load my app.

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:41.216 A:middle
As we can see, I am shipping

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:43.226 A:middle
this app with four styles; City,

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:45.066 A:middle
Glass, Oils and Waves.

00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:47.606 A:middle
And then I can pick images from

00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:49.256 A:middle
the photo library of the users

00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:51.096 A:middle
and then process them blending

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.736 A:middle
them in different styles right

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:53.226 A:middle
on device.

00:13:53.976 --> 00:13:55.406 A:middle
So this is the original image,

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.076 A:middle
and I am going to render the

00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:57.716 A:middle
City style,

00:13:59.636 --> 00:13:59.976 A:middle
Glass,
