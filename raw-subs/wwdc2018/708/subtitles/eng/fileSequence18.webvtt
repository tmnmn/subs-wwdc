00:17:58.306 --> 00:18:02.076 A:middle
So in this demo we saw how we

00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:04.336 A:middle
started with four models and

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:06.606 A:middle
they were huge, in 32-bit -- or

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:08.716 A:middle
total app size was 27 megabytes.

00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:10.966 A:middle
Then we evaluated the quality

00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:12.466 A:middle
and switched to 4-bit models,

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:14.406 A:middle
and the total size of our app

00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:16.526 A:middle
went down to just 3.4 megabytes.

00:18:16.806 --> 00:18:16.873 A:middle
Now --

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:22.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:23.146 --> 00:18:24.646 A:middle
This doesn't cost us anything in

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.756 A:middle
terms of quality because all

00:18:26.756 --> 00:18:27.646 A:middle
these versions -- these

00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:29.456 A:middle
quantized versions look the

00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:31.626 A:middle
same, and the quality is still

00:18:31.626 --> 00:18:32.076 A:middle
amazing.

00:18:32.616 --> 00:18:36.006 A:middle
We showed how quantization can

00:18:36.006 --> 00:18:37.446 A:middle
help us reduce the size of an

00:18:37.446 --> 00:18:39.166 A:middle
app by reducing the size of the

00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:40.796 A:middle
weight at the very microscopic

00:18:40.796 --> 00:18:41.046 A:middle
level.

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:44.356 A:middle
Now let's see how we can reduce

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.546 A:middle
the number of models that your

00:18:45.546 --> 00:18:45.976 A:middle
app needs.

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.866 A:middle
In the most straightforward

00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:51.446 A:middle
case, if your app has three

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:52.936 A:middle
machine-learning functionalities

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:54.496 A:middle
then you need three different

00:18:54.496 --> 00:18:55.536 A:middle
machine-learning models.

00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:58.206 A:middle
But in some cases, it is

00:18:58.206 --> 00:19:01.206 A:middle
possible to have the same model
