00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:00.716 A:middle
Now for every model and

00:17:00.716 --> 00:17:02.156 A:middle
quantization technique, there is

00:17:02.156 --> 00:17:03.356 A:middle
always a point in which things

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.526 A:middle
start to mismatch.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:08.376 A:middle
Now we -- after some discussion

00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:09.526 A:middle
with the designer, extensive

00:17:09.526 --> 00:17:10.846 A:middle
evaluation of many images, we

00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:12.156 A:middle
decided to ship the 4-bit

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:13.415 A:middle
version of this model, which is

00:17:13.715 --> 00:17:15.086 A:middle
the smallest size for the best

00:17:15.086 --> 00:17:15.506 A:middle
quality.

00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:17.886 A:middle
So let's remove all the

00:17:17.886 --> 00:17:19.566 A:middle
floating-point version of the

00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:21.445 A:middle
models that were taking a lot of

00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:23.996 A:middle
space in our app and replace

00:17:23.996 --> 00:17:25.976 A:middle
them with the 4-bit version.

00:17:30.736 --> 00:17:32.516 A:middle
And now let's run the app one

00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:32.956 A:middle
last time.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.846 A:middle
OK. Let's pick the same image

00:17:41.846 --> 00:17:48.886 A:middle
again and show all the styles.

00:17:48.886 --> 00:17:54.186 A:middle
This was the City, Glass, Oils,

00:17:54.926 --> 00:17:56.996 A:middle
and big Wave.

00:17:58.306 --> 00:18:02.076 A:middle
So in this demo we saw how we
