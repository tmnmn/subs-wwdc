00:27:00.106 --> 00:27:01.706 A:middle
In fact, for your app all you

00:27:01.706 --> 00:27:02.666 A:middle
are really concerned with for

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:05.336 A:middle
your users is going from a long

00:27:05.336 --> 00:27:06.636 A:middle
time to get results to a short

00:27:06.676 --> 00:27:06.886 A:middle
time.

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:10.096 A:middle
So this year we are introducing

00:27:10.096 --> 00:27:11.796 A:middle
a new batch API that will allow

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.026 A:middle
you to do exactly this.

00:27:14.096 --> 00:27:15.336 A:middle
Where before you needed to loop

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:16.386 A:middle
over your inputs and call

00:27:16.386 --> 00:27:18.056 A:middle
separate predictions, the new

00:27:18.056 --> 00:27:19.156 A:middle
API is very simple.

00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:22.516 A:middle
One-line predictions, it

00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:24.366 A:middle
consumes an input -- an array of

00:27:24.366 --> 00:27:25.946 A:middle
inputs and produces an array of

00:27:25.946 --> 00:27:26.566 A:middle
outputs.

00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:27.826 A:middle
Core ML will take care of the

00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:27.976 A:middle
rest.

00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:34.336 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:34.836 --> 00:27:35.716 A:middle
So let's see it in action.

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:38.696 A:middle
So in keeping with our style

00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:40.386 A:middle
transfer example, let's look at

00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:41.376 A:middle
the case where we wanted to

00:27:41.376 --> 00:27:42.776 A:middle
apply a style to our entire

00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:43.586 A:middle
photo library.

00:27:43.956 --> 00:27:45.046 A:middle
So here I have a simple app

00:27:45.116 --> 00:27:46.066 A:middle
that's going to do just that.

00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:47.926 A:middle
I am going to apply a style to

00:27:47.926 --> 00:27:48.946 A:middle
200 images.

00:27:49.206 --> 00:27:51.396 A:middle
On the left, as in your left,

00:27:51.976 --> 00:27:54.026 A:middle
there is an implementation using

00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:55.526 A:middle
last year's API in a for loop.

00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:57.636 A:middle
And on the right we have the new

00:27:57.636 --> 00:27:58.276 A:middle
batch API.

00:27:58.626 --> 00:27:59.346 A:middle
So let's get started.
