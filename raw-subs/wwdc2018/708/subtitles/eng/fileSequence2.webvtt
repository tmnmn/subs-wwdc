00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:00.816 A:middle
than those implementation

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:01.216 A:middle
details.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:06.556 A:middle
Adding a Core ML model to your

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.106 A:middle
app is simple as adding that

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:09.666 A:middle
file to your Xcode project.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:12.456 A:middle
Xcode will give you a simple

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.206 A:middle
view, describe what it does in

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:17.106 A:middle
terms of the inputs it requires

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:18.616 A:middle
and the outputs it provides.

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:21.476 A:middle
Xcode will take this one step

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:22.576 A:middle
further and generate an

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.186 A:middle
interface for you, so that

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.336 A:middle
interacting with this model is

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:29.206 A:middle
just a few lines of code, one to

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:31.916 A:middle
load the model, one to make a

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:34.526 A:middle
prediction, and sometimes one to

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:35.876 A:middle
pull out the specific output you

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:36.516 A:middle
are interested in.

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.206 A:middle
Note that in some cases you

00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:40.116 A:middle
don't even have to write back

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:41.806 A:middle
code because Core ML integrates

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:43.296 A:middle
with some of our higher-level

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.966 A:middle
APIs and allows you to customize

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:46.416 A:middle
their behavior if you give them

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.286 A:middle
a Core ML model.

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:49.576 A:middle
So with Vision, this is done

00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:51.106 A:middle
through the VNCoreML Request

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:51.496 A:middle
object.

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:53.106 A:middle
And in the new Natural Language

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.586 A:middle
framework, you can instantiate

00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:56.536 A:middle
an MLModel from a CoreML model.

00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:00.786 A:middle
So that's Core ML in a nutshell.
