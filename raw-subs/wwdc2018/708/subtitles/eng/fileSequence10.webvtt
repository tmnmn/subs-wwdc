00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.966 A:middle
And for example, we can

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:04.276 A:middle
constrain the network to take,

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:06.156 A:middle
instead of one of 56 different

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:08.056 A:middle
values, for example, just 8.

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:11.246 A:middle
And since now we now have only 8

00:10:11.246 --> 00:10:13.926 A:middle
options, Core ML will need 3-bit

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:15.966 A:middle
values per weight to store your

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:16.306 A:middle
model.

00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:19.726 A:middle
There are now some details about

00:10:19.726 --> 00:10:20.806 A:middle
how we are going to choose these

00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:22.316 A:middle
values to represent the weights.

00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:24.486 A:middle
They can be uniformly

00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:26.256 A:middle
distributed in this range, and

00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:27.576 A:middle
in this case we have linear

00:10:27.576 --> 00:10:30.276 A:middle
quantization instead in lookup

00:10:30.356 --> 00:10:33.856 A:middle
table quantization, we can have

00:10:33.906 --> 00:10:35.356 A:middle
these values scattered in this

00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:37.146 A:middle
range in an arbitrary manner.

00:10:37.766 --> 00:10:39.246 A:middle
So let's see practically how

00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:40.906 A:middle
quantization can help us reduce

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:41.826 A:middle
the size of our model.

00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:43.256 A:middle
In this example, you are

00:10:43.256 --> 00:10:45.506 A:middle
focusing on Resnet50, which is a

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:47.186 A:middle
common architecture used by many

00:10:47.186 --> 00:10:48.526 A:middle
applications for many different

00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:48.846 A:middle
tasks.

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:52.106 A:middle
It includes 25 million trained

00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:54.426 A:middle
parameters and this means that

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:56.186 A:middle
you have to use 32-bit floats to

00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:56.916 A:middle
represent it.

00:10:57.946 --> 00:10:59.386 A:middle
Then the total model size is

00:10:59.386 --> 00:11:00.616 A:middle
more than 100 megabytes.
