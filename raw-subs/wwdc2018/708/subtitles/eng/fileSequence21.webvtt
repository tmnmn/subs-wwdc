00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:01.356 A:middle
size -- besides the fact that

00:21:01.356 --> 00:21:02.516 A:middle
the network has been trained to

00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:03.736 A:middle
support any resolution.

00:21:04.526 --> 00:21:05.186 A:middle
Not anymore.

00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:06.866 A:middle
We are introducing flexible

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:07.246 A:middle
shapes.

00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:09.036 A:middle
And with flexible shapes, you

00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:10.526 A:middle
have -- if you have -- you can

00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:12.286 A:middle
have the single model to process

00:21:12.286 --> 00:21:13.776 A:middle
more resolutions and many more

00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:14.426 A:middle
resolutions.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:15.926 A:middle
So now in Xcode --

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:20.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:21.386 --> 00:21:23.416 A:middle
-- in Xcode you are going to see

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.016 A:middle
that this -- the input is still

00:21:26.016 --> 00:21:27.986 A:middle
an image, but the size of the

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.746 A:middle
full resolution, the model also

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:31.896 A:middle
accepts flexible resolutions.

00:21:32.066 --> 00:21:33.806 A:middle
In this simple example, SD and

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:34.173 A:middle
HD.

00:21:34.173 --> 00:21:37.566 A:middle
This means that now you have to

00:21:37.566 --> 00:21:38.786 A:middle
ship a single model.

00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:41.426 A:middle
You don't have to have any

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.266 A:middle
redundant code.

00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:44.316 A:middle
And if you need to switch

00:21:44.316 --> 00:21:45.726 A:middle
between standard definition and

00:21:45.726 --> 00:21:46.906 A:middle
high definition, you can do it

00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:48.386 A:middle
much faster because we don't

00:21:48.386 --> 00:21:49.456 A:middle
need to reload the model from

00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:50.876 A:middle
scratch; we just need to resize

00:21:51.496 --> 00:21:51.566 A:middle
it.

00:21:52.236 --> 00:21:54.186 A:middle
You have two options to specify

00:21:54.186 --> 00:21:55.716 A:middle
the flexibility of the model.

00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:58.556 A:middle
You can define a range for its

00:21:58.556 --> 00:22:00.416 A:middle
dimension, so you can define a
