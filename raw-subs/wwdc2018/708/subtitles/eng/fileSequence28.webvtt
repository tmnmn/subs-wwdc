00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:01.156 A:middle
We are off.

00:28:03.596 --> 00:28:04.606 A:middle
And we can see the new is

00:28:04.606 --> 00:28:05.176 A:middle
already done.

00:28:05.176 --> 00:28:06.756 A:middle
We'll wait a moment for last

00:28:06.756 --> 00:28:08.916 A:middle
year's technology, and there we

00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:08.983 A:middle
go.

00:28:09.516 --> 00:28:14.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:15.296 --> 00:28:16.556 A:middle
In this example we see a

00:28:16.556 --> 00:28:18.006 A:middle
noticeable improvement with the

00:28:18.006 --> 00:28:18.756 A:middle
new batch API.

00:28:19.136 --> 00:28:20.836 A:middle
And in general, the improvement

00:28:20.836 --> 00:28:22.096 A:middle
you'll see in your app depends

00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:23.906 A:middle
on the model and the device and

00:28:23.906 --> 00:28:24.546 A:middle
the workload.

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:26.186 A:middle
But if you have a large number

00:28:26.186 --> 00:28:27.746 A:middle
of predictions to call, use the

00:28:27.746 --> 00:28:29.606 A:middle
new API and give Core ML every

00:28:29.606 --> 00:28:30.606 A:middle
opportunity to accelerate your

00:28:30.606 --> 00:28:30.976 A:middle
computation.

00:28:35.666 --> 00:28:36.796 A:middle
Of course, the most

00:28:36.796 --> 00:28:37.806 A:middle
high-performance app in the

00:28:37.806 --> 00:28:39.746 A:middle
world isn't terribly exciting if

00:28:39.746 --> 00:28:40.596 A:middle
it's not delivering an

00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:41.846 A:middle
experience that you want for

00:28:41.846 --> 00:28:42.526 A:middle
your users.

00:28:43.666 --> 00:28:44.966 A:middle
We want to ensure that no matter

00:28:44.966 --> 00:28:46.846 A:middle
what that experience is, or what

00:28:46.846 --> 00:28:48.546 A:middle
it could be in the future, Core

00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:50.066 A:middle
ML will be just as performant

00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:51.336 A:middle
and simple to use as ever.

00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:53.286 A:middle
But the field of machine

00:28:53.286 --> 00:28:54.656 A:middle
learning is growing rapidly.

00:28:55.186 --> 00:28:56.086 A:middle
How will we keep up?

00:28:56.786 --> 00:28:57.926 A:middle
And just how rapidly?

00:28:57.976 --> 00:28:59.406 A:middle
Well let me tell you a little

00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:00.636 A:middle
bit of a personal story about
