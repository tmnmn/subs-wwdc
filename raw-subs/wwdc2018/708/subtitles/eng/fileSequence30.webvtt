00:30:00.366 --> 00:30:02.366 A:middle
So a few more years pass.

00:30:02.486 --> 00:30:03.856 A:middle
Now I work at Apple, and my

00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:05.226 A:middle
perspective on this problem has

00:30:05.226 --> 00:30:06.476 A:middle
changed again.

00:30:06.476 --> 00:30:09.256 A:middle
Now, just grab Create ML.

00:30:09.436 --> 00:30:10.656 A:middle
The UI is lovely.

00:30:10.656 --> 00:30:11.696 A:middle
You'll have a horse classifier

00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:12.526 A:middle
in just a few minutes.

00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:15.046 A:middle
So, you know, if you are a

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.226 A:middle
machine learning expert, maybe

00:30:16.226 --> 00:30:17.136 A:middle
you are looking at this and you

00:30:17.136 --> 00:30:18.016 A:middle
are thinking, "Oh, this guy

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:18.926 A:middle
doesn't know what he is talking

00:30:18.926 --> 00:30:19.196 A:middle
about.

00:30:19.196 --> 00:30:20.506 A:middle
You know, in 2007 I knew how to

00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:21.376 A:middle
solve that problem.

00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:23.336 A:middle
In 2012 I'd solved it a hundred

00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:23.646 A:middle
times."

00:30:24.506 --> 00:30:25.076 A:middle
Not my point.

00:30:25.756 --> 00:30:27.146 A:middle
If you are someone who cares

00:30:27.146 --> 00:30:29.446 A:middle
about long-lasting, high-quality

00:30:29.446 --> 00:30:30.976 A:middle
software, this should make you

00:30:30.976 --> 00:30:32.796 A:middle
nervous, because in 11 years we

00:30:32.796 --> 00:30:34.136 A:middle
have seen the entire picture of

00:30:34.136 --> 00:30:35.126 A:middle
this problem turn over.

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:37.386 A:middle
So let's take a look at a few

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:38.676 A:middle
more features in Core ML that

00:30:38.676 --> 00:30:40.146 A:middle
can help set your mind at ease.

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.346 A:middle
To do that, let's open the hood

00:30:43.346 --> 00:30:44.586 A:middle
once again and peek at one of

00:30:44.586 --> 00:30:46.176 A:middle
these new horse finder models,

00:30:46.656 --> 00:30:48.406 A:middle
which is, once again, a neural

00:30:48.406 --> 00:30:48.766 A:middle
network.

00:30:49.526 --> 00:30:51.106 A:middle
As we have illustrated before,

00:30:51.306 --> 00:30:52.696 A:middle
the neural network consists of a

00:30:52.696 --> 00:30:54.266 A:middle
series of highly optimized

00:30:54.266 --> 00:30:54.696 A:middle
layers.

00:30:54.746 --> 00:30:56.266 A:middle
It is a series of layers, and we

00:30:56.266 --> 00:30:57.176 A:middle
have highly optimized

00:30:57.176 --> 00:30:58.586 A:middle
implementations for each of them

00:30:58.626 --> 00:30:59.916 A:middle
in our inference engine.
