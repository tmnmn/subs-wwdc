00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:00.786 A:middle
So that's Core ML in a nutshell.

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:02.576 A:middle
But we are here to talk about

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:03.096 A:middle
what's new.

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:05.826 A:middle
We took all the great feedback

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:06.886 A:middle
we received from you over the

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.796 A:middle
past year and focused on some

00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:11.086 A:middle
key enhancements to CoreML 2.

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:13.666 A:middle
And we are going to talk about

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:14.736 A:middle
these in two sessions.

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:16.836 A:middle
In the first session, the one

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:17.626 A:middle
you are all sitting in right

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:18.786 A:middle
now, we are going to talk about

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:20.176 A:middle
what's new from the perspective

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:21.646 A:middle
of your app.

00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:23.146 A:middle
In the second session, which

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.716 A:middle
starts immediately after this at

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:26.736 A:middle
10 a.m. after a short break, we

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:29.046 A:middle
are going to talk about tools

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:30.786 A:middle
and how you can update and

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:32.186 A:middle
convert models to take advantage

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:33.456 A:middle
of the new features in Core ML

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:33.676 A:middle
2.

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:37.836 A:middle
When it comes to your app, we

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.426 A:middle
are going to focus on three key

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:39.896 A:middle
areas.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:42.746 A:middle
The first is how you can reduce

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.656 A:middle
the size and number of models

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:46.246 A:middle
using your app while still

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:47.616 A:middle
getting the same functionality.

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:50.206 A:middle
Then we'll look about how you

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:51.846 A:middle
can get more performance out of

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:52.496 A:middle
a single model.

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:55.286 A:middle
And then we'll conclude about

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:57.086 A:middle
how using Core ML will allow you

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:58.196 A:middle
to keep pace with the

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.686 A:middle
state-of-the-art and rapidly

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:00.946 A:middle
moving field of machine
