00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:00.766 A:middle
as an input, all we can do as

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.436 A:middle
developers is size -- or resize

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:06.236 A:middle
the image down, process it, and

00:20:06.236 --> 00:20:06.976 A:middle
then scale it back up.

00:20:07.786 --> 00:20:09.346 A:middle
This is not really going to

00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:10.206 A:middle
amaze the user.

00:20:10.206 --> 00:20:14.336 A:middle
Even in the past, we could

00:20:14.336 --> 00:20:16.146 A:middle
reship this model with Corel ML

00:20:16.146 --> 00:20:18.206 A:middle
Tools and make it accept any

00:20:18.206 --> 00:20:20.396 A:middle
resolution, in particular, a

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:21.826 A:middle
higher-resolution image.

00:20:23.246 --> 00:20:24.756 A:middle
So even in the past we could do

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:27.096 A:middle
this feature and feed directly

00:20:27.096 --> 00:20:28.716 A:middle
the high-resolution image to a

00:20:28.716 --> 00:20:30.446 A:middle
Corel ML model, producing a

00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:31.576 A:middle
high-definition result.

00:20:31.576 --> 00:20:34.366 A:middle
This is because we wanted to

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.436 A:middle
introduce a finer detail in the

00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:38.706 A:middle
stylization and the way finer

00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:40.966 A:middle
strokes that are amazing when

00:20:40.966 --> 00:20:42.406 A:middle
you zoom in, because they have

00:20:42.706 --> 00:20:43.826 A:middle
-- they add a lot of work into

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:44.516 A:middle
the final image.

00:20:44.516 --> 00:20:47.646 A:middle
So in the past we could do it,

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:49.656 A:middle
but we could do it by

00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:51.116 A:middle
duplicating the model and

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:52.606 A:middle
creating two different versions:

00:20:53.096 --> 00:20:54.576 A:middle
one for the standard definition

00:20:54.576 --> 00:20:55.376 A:middle
and one for the high

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:56.046 A:middle
definitions.

00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:57.796 A:middle
And this, of course, means that

00:20:57.796 --> 00:20:59.726 A:middle
our app is twice as much the

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:01.356 A:middle
size -- besides the fact that
