00:15:59.016 --> 00:16:00.676 A:middle
Now we can compare it with the

00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:01.716 A:middle
8-bit version.

00:16:02.036 --> 00:16:05.796 A:middle
And you can see nothing has

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:06.186 A:middle
changed.

00:16:06.796 --> 00:16:07.806 A:middle
This is because 8-bit

00:16:07.806 --> 00:16:09.156 A:middle
quantization methods are very

00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:09.536 A:middle
solid.

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:13.176 A:middle
We can also venture further and

00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:14.956 A:middle
try the 4-bit version of this

00:16:14.956 --> 00:16:15.316 A:middle
model.

00:16:15.866 --> 00:16:18.256 A:middle
Wow. The results are still

00:16:18.256 --> 00:16:18.626 A:middle
great.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.366 A:middle
And now let's try the 3-bit

00:16:21.366 --> 00:16:21.836 A:middle
version.

00:16:24.556 --> 00:16:26.386 A:middle
We see that there are -- we see

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:27.506 A:middle
the first color shift.

00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:29.116 A:middle
So it probably is good if we go

00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:30.426 A:middle
and check with the designers if

00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:32.446 A:middle
this effect is still acceptable.

00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:34.596 A:middle
And now, as we see the 2-bit

00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:37.256 A:middle
version, this is not really what

00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:37.926 A:middle
we were looking for.

00:16:37.926 --> 00:16:39.056 A:middle
Maybe we will save it for a

00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:40.376 A:middle
horror app, but I am not going

00:16:40.376 --> 00:16:40.976 A:middle
to show this to the designer.

00:16:41.516 --> 00:16:46.026 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:47.526 A:middle
Let's go back to the 4-bit

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:48.626 A:middle
version and hide this one.

00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:51.056 A:middle
This was just a reminder that

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:52.686 A:middle
quantized models are

00:16:52.686 --> 00:16:54.156 A:middle
approximation of the original

00:16:54.156 --> 00:16:54.356 A:middle
models.

00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:56.366 A:middle
So it's always recommended to

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.866 A:middle
check them and compare with the

00:16:57.866 --> 00:16:58.696 A:middle
original versions.

00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:00.716 A:middle
Now for every model and
