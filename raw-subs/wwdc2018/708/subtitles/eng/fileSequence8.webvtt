00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:00.966 A:middle
And the first, really, is of

00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:02.606 A:middle
Core ML in iOS 11.

00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:04.816 A:middle
Neural networks were stored

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:07.296 A:middle
using floating-point 32-bit

00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:07.856 A:middle
weights.

00:08:08.496 --> 00:08:12.466 A:middle
In iOS 11.2, we heard your

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:13.856 A:middle
feedback and we introduced half

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:16.006 A:middle
precision floating-point 16

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:16.246 A:middle
weight.

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:18.986 A:middle
This gives your app half the

00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:21.126 A:middle
storage required for the same

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:21.646 A:middle
accuracy.

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:23.756 A:middle
But this year we wanted to take

00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.616 A:middle
several steps further, and we

00:08:25.616 --> 00:08:27.116 A:middle
are introducing quantized

00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:27.336 A:middle
weights.

00:08:28.576 --> 00:08:29.836 A:middle
With quantized weights we are no

00:08:29.836 --> 00:08:31.526 A:middle
longer restricted to use either

00:08:31.526 --> 00:08:33.756 A:middle
Float 32 or Float 16 values.

00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:35.236 A:middle
But neural networks can be

00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:37.956 A:middle
encoded using 8 bits, 4 bits,

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.515 A:middle
any bits all the way down to 1

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:41.976 A:middle
bit.

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:43.876 A:middle
So let's now see what

00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:45.166 A:middle
quantization here is.

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:47.746 A:middle
Here we are representing a

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:49.176 A:middle
subset of the weights of our

00:08:49.176 --> 00:08:49.986 A:middle
neural networks.

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:52.186 A:middle
As we can see, these weights can

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:54.166 A:middle
take any value in a continuous

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:54.486 A:middle
range.

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.426 A:middle
This means that in theory, a

00:08:57.426 --> 00:08:58.726 A:middle
single weight can take an

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.086 A:middle
infinite number of possible
