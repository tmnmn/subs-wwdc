moving field of machine

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:01.236 A:middle
learning.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:03.466 A:middle
So to kick it off, let's talk

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:04.346 A:middle
about model size.

00:04:04.486 --> 00:04:05.366 A:middle
I'm going to hand it off to

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:05.966 A:middle
Francesco.

[ Applause ]

00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:11.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Michael.

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:15.936 A:middle
Hello. Every ways to reduce the

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:17.476 A:middle
size of your Core ML app is very

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:18.005 A:middle
important.

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:19.935 A:middle
My name is Francesco, and I am

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:21.286 A:middle
going to introduce quantization

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:23.266 A:middle
and flexible shapes, two new

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.086 A:middle
features in Core ML 2 that can

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:28.306 A:middle
help reduce your app size.

00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:30.326 A:middle
So Core ML, [inaudible] why

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:32.506 A:middle
should you learn in models and

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:33.486 A:middle
device.

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:34.786 A:middle
This gives your app four key

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.316 A:middle
advantages compared to running

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:36.966 A:middle
them in the cloud.

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:39.746 A:middle
First of all, user privacy is

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:40.476 A:middle
fully respected.

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:42.066 A:middle
There are many machine-learning

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:42.976 A:middle
models on device.

00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:45.406 A:middle
We guarantee that the data never

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:46.836 A:middle
leaves the device of the user.

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.636 A:middle
Second, it can help you achieve

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:50.626 A:middle
real-time performance.

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:52.956 A:middle
And for silicon [phonetic] and

00:04:52.956 --> 00:04:54.956 A:middle
devices are super- efficient for

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:56.136 A:middle
machine-learning workloads.

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.226 A:middle
Furthermore, you don't have to

00:04:58.226 --> 00:04:59.796 A:middle
maintain and pay for Internet

00:04:59.796 --> 00:05:00.256 A:middle
servers.
