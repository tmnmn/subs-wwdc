00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:01.686 A:middle
for types and functionality, but

00:36:01.686 --> 00:36:02.656 A:middle
they do require more

00:36:02.656 --> 00:36:04.006 A:middle
implementation work on your

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:05.436 A:middle
part.

00:36:05.806 --> 00:36:07.316 A:middle
Both forms of customization

00:36:07.316 --> 00:36:08.916 A:middle
allow you to encapsulate model

00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:10.346 A:middle
parameters in an ML model,

00:36:10.826 --> 00:36:12.176 A:middle
making the model portable and

00:36:12.176 --> 00:36:13.156 A:middle
your code simpler.

00:36:14.516 --> 00:36:16.816 A:middle
And we've only been able to

00:36:16.816 --> 00:36:18.146 A:middle
touch on a few of the great new

00:36:18.146 --> 00:36:19.506 A:middle
features in Core ML 2.

00:36:20.146 --> 00:36:22.336 A:middle
Please download the beta, try

00:36:22.336 --> 00:36:22.976 A:middle
them out for yourself.

00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:28.556 A:middle
Core ML has many great new

00:36:28.556 --> 00:36:29.926 A:middle
features to reduce your app

00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:31.916 A:middle
size, improve performance, and

00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:33.136 A:middle
ensure flexibility and

00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:34.476 A:middle
compatibility with the latest

00:36:34.476 --> 00:36:35.406 A:middle
developments in machine

00:36:35.406 --> 00:36:35.686 A:middle
learning.

00:36:36.496 --> 00:36:37.886 A:middle
We showed you how quantization

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:39.676 A:middle
can reduce model size, how the

00:36:39.676 --> 00:36:41.336 A:middle
new batch API can enable more

00:36:41.336 --> 00:36:43.156 A:middle
efficient processing, and how

00:36:43.156 --> 00:36:44.936 A:middle
custom layers and custom models

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.226 A:middle
can help you bring cutting-edge

00:36:46.226 --> 00:36:47.446 A:middle
machine learning to your app.

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:49.756 A:middle
Combined with our great new tool

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:51.236 A:middle
for training models in Create

00:36:51.236 --> 00:36:52.746 A:middle
ML, there are more ways than

00:36:52.746 --> 00:36:54.596 A:middle
ever to add ML-enabled features

00:36:54.596 --> 00:36:56.176 A:middle
to your app and support great

00:36:56.176 --> 00:36:57.736 A:middle
new experiences for your users.

00:36:59.576 --> 00:37:01.376 A:middle
After just a short break, we'll
