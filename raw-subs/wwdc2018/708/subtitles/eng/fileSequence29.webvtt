00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:00.636 A:middle
bit of a personal story about

00:29:00.666 --> 00:29:00.876 A:middle
that.

00:29:02.246 --> 00:29:03.496 A:middle
Let's take a look at a

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:05.196 A:middle
deceptively simple question that

00:29:05.196 --> 00:29:06.346 A:middle
we can answer with machine

00:29:06.346 --> 00:29:06.626 A:middle
learning.

00:29:07.686 --> 00:29:09.256 A:middle
Given an image, what I want to

00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:11.536 A:middle
know: Are there any horses in

00:29:11.536 --> 00:29:11.603 A:middle
it?

00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:14.346 A:middle
So I think I heard a chuckle or

00:29:14.346 --> 00:29:14.626 A:middle
two.

00:29:14.626 --> 00:29:15.666 A:middle
Maybe this seems like kind of a

00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:16.836 A:middle
silly challenge problem.

00:29:16.836 --> 00:29:18.626 A:middle
Small children love this, by the

00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:18.856 A:middle
way.

00:29:19.086 --> 00:29:22.056 A:middle
But -- so way, way back in the

00:29:22.106 --> 00:29:23.356 A:middle
past, when I was first starting

00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:24.446 A:middle
graduate school and I was

00:29:24.446 --> 00:29:25.746 A:middle
thinking about this problem and

00:29:25.746 --> 00:29:26.736 A:middle
first learning about machine

00:29:26.736 --> 00:29:28.476 A:middle
learning, my insights on the top

00:29:28.476 --> 00:29:29.426 A:middle
came down to something like

00:29:29.426 --> 00:29:32.306 A:middle
this: I don't know -- seems

00:29:32.306 --> 00:29:32.546 A:middle
hard.

00:29:33.226 --> 00:29:34.276 A:middle
I don't really have any good

00:29:34.276 --> 00:29:34.776 A:middle
idea for you.

00:29:35.896 --> 00:29:38.106 A:middle
So a few years pass.

00:29:38.266 --> 00:29:39.716 A:middle
I get older, hopefully a little

00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:40.316 A:middle
bit wiser.

00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:41.466 A:middle
But certainly the field is

00:29:41.466 --> 00:29:42.676 A:middle
moving very, very quickly,

00:29:42.676 --> 00:29:43.836 A:middle
because there started to be a

00:29:43.836 --> 00:29:45.176 A:middle
lot of exciting new results

00:29:45.176 --> 00:29:46.686 A:middle
using deep neural networks.

00:29:47.736 --> 00:29:48.926 A:middle
And so then my view on this

00:29:48.926 --> 00:29:49.676 A:middle
problem changed.

00:29:49.676 --> 00:29:50.716 A:middle
And suddenly, wow, this

00:29:50.716 --> 00:29:52.036 A:middle
cutting-edge research can really

00:29:52.036 --> 00:29:53.366 A:middle
answer these kind of questions,

00:29:53.366 --> 00:29:54.756 A:middle
and computers can catch up with

00:29:54.756 --> 00:29:55.556 A:middle
small children and horse

00:29:55.556 --> 00:29:56.196 A:middle
recognition technology.

00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:56.976 A:middle
What an exciting development.

00:29:57.516 --> 00:29:59.866 A:middle
