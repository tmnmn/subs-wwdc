00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:02.156 A:middle
health, we establish a secure

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.586 A:middle
connection to healthcare

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:07.176 A:middle
institutions and download users'

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:09.496 A:middle
health records in FHIR direct to

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.675 A:middle
their iOS devices.

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:14.816 A:middle
From here we it store securely

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:18.266 A:middle
in HealthKit and aggregate data

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:20.076 A:middle
across multiple institutions.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:24.986 A:middle
Starting today in iOS 12 we are

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:26.986 A:middle
providing APIs to allow you to

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.916 A:middle
access this data and work with

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:30.000 A:middle
it in your apps.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:36.846 A:middle
First, I'm going to introduce

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.536 A:middle
the new sample types that we've

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:39.956 A:middle
added to support this feature.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:42.916 A:middle
Then we can see how you

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:44.766 A:middle
authorize your application and

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.000 A:middle
query for data.

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:49.556 A:middle
After that, I'll take a brief

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:51.286 A:middle
dive into FHIR and show you

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:52.876 A:middle
what's possible here.

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:56.706 A:middle
And finally, we can take some

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:58.336 A:middle
time to think about how you can

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.606 A:middle
help protect your users' privacy
