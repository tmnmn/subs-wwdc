00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:01.366 A:middle
experience or perhaps if you

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:04.266 A:middle
have a research app you need

00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:06.926 A:middle
access to a comprehensive set of

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.056 A:middle
types to avoid skewed results.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:13.636 A:middle
We have a new required types key

00:14:13.636 --> 00:14:15.426 A:middle
in the Info.plist, which allows

00:14:15.426 --> 00:14:17.276 A:middle
you to specify these types.

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:20.216 A:middle
And if they're present we will

00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:22.186 A:middle
return a new required types

00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:24.666 A:middle
error if the user has not

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.656 A:middle
granted access to these types.

00:14:27.086 --> 00:14:28.656 A:middle
And this allows you to determine

00:14:28.656 --> 00:14:31.136 A:middle
how to behave, optionally

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:32.376 A:middle
explaining to the user that you

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:33.966 A:middle
cannot continue if you don't

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:34.636 A:middle
have this data.

00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:40.406 A:middle
You can implement this by adding

00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:42.086 A:middle
the new required read

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:43.496 A:middle
authorization key to your

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:44.536 A:middle
Info.plist.

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:47.426 A:middle
Here I'm specifying that I

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:49.606 A:middle
require allergies, conditions

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:50.726 A:middle
and immunizations.

00:14:51.316 --> 00:14:54.436 A:middle
And then you handle the new

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.606 A:middle
error in the authorization

00:14:56.606 --> 00:14:56.926 A:middle
request.
