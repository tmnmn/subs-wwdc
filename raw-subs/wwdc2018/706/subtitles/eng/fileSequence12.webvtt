You should be aware that in

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:02.526 A:middle
order to maintain user privacy

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.066 A:middle
we don't reveal to you which

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:07.046 A:middle
categories a user has granted

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:08.976 A:middle
access or denied access to.

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:14.676 A:middle
And now to querying.

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.306 A:middle
Because HKClinicalRecord is an

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:19.306 A:middle
HKSample you can take advantage

00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:21.296 A:middle
of all of the existing sample

00:12:21.296 --> 00:12:22.506 A:middle
query infrastructure in

00:12:22.506 --> 00:12:23.036 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:25.406 A:middle
Things like SampleQuery,

00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:27.266 A:middle
AnchoredObjectQuery and

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.936 A:middle
ObserverQuery will all work and

00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:31.366 A:middle
if your user has granted

00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:33.476 A:middle
continuous access background

00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:37.706 A:middle
delivery will also work.

00:12:38.396 --> 00:12:40.296 A:middle
Again, you define the type that

00:12:40.296 --> 00:12:41.496 A:middle
you wish to query for.

00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:45.006 A:middle
We're creating a sample query

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:48.226 A:middle
here and you can execute that on

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:48.836 A:middle
the Health Store.

00:12:53.076 --> 00:12:54.006 A:middle
So that's the basic

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.146 A:middle
authorization flow.

00:12:55.606 --> 00:12:57.446 A:middle
But we've actually introduced

00:12:57.446 --> 00:12:59.216 A:middle
some additional mechanisms

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:00.856 A:middle
specific to Health Records.
