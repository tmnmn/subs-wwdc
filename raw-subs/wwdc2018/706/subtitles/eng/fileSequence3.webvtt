00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.606 A:middle
help protect your users' privacy

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:04.976 A:middle
in this sensitive domain.

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:06.116 A:middle
So let's jump right in.

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:10.086 A:middle
If you've used HealthKit before

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:11.766 A:middle
you may be familiar with

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:14.246 A:middle
HKSampleType and its subclasses.

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.696 A:middle
These group similar types of

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:20.336 A:middle
data, for example QuantityType

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:22.846 A:middle
groups data represented by a

00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:25.286 A:middle
single numerical value, things

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:27.396 A:middle
like step count and heart rate.

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:30.416 A:middle
While CategoryType groups data

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:32.336 A:middle
characterized by enumeration,

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.736 A:middle
things like sleep analysis, am I

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:37.936 A:middle
in bed or asleep or menstrual

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:39.636 A:middle
flow, heavy or light.

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:43.506 A:middle
And to support Health Records

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:46.256 A:middle
we're introducing HKClinicalType

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.026 A:middle
which groups the categories of

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:50.146 A:middle
health records that you see in

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.286 A:middle
Health, things like conditions

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:52.976 A:middle
and medications.

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:58.116 A:middle
Within each of these sample

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.076 A:middle
types the different data types
