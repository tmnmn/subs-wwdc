00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.136 A:middle
sensitive information.

00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:02.806 A:middle
A user's health records might

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:05.116 A:middle
contain details of medications

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:06.446 A:middle
that they are taking or

00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
conditions that they are living

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:09.206 A:middle
with on a daily basis.

00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:12.196 A:middle
This is information they may not

00:08:12.196 --> 00:08:13.866 A:middle
be comfortable sharing with a

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:15.536 A:middle
close friend or family member.

00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:18.936 A:middle
And it can change over time as a

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:20.496 A:middle
user interacts with their

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:22.756 A:middle
healthcare institution, they

00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:25.246 A:middle
might receive a new diagnosis of

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:25.776 A:middle
a condition.

00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:28.566 A:middle
So to help our users better

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:31.276 A:middle
understand and manage access to

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:33.166 A:middle
that data we're introducing a

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:35.976 A:middle
new authorization flow specific

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:36.936 A:middle
to Health Records.

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:39.566 A:middle
When your app requests

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:41.846 A:middle
authorization we will present a

00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
new permission sheet specific to

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:45.446 A:middle
clinical types.

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:49.516 A:middle
First, we inform users what it

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:51.346 A:middle
means to share that data with

00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:53.666 A:middle
your app and just how sensitive

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:55.766 A:middle
it is.

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:57.446 A:middle
Since we will present this new

00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:59.576 A:middle
authorization flow, whenever you
