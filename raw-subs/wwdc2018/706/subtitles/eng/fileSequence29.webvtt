00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
FHIR comes into play.

00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:03.356 A:middle
FHIR gives a way to use

00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:05.066 A:middle
predefined codes rather than

00:29:05.066 --> 00:29:07.146 A:middle
natural language to specify what

00:29:07.146 --> 00:29:07.616 A:middle
things are.

00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:11.106 A:middle
So after taking a look at the

00:29:11.106 --> 00:29:13.326 A:middle
FHIR documentation here's the

00:29:13.326 --> 00:29:14.806 A:middle
algorithm I've come up with to

00:29:14.806 --> 00:29:16.736 A:middle
identify a chickenpox vaccine.

00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:20.066 A:middle
First, I'll take the

00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:23.406 A:middle
immunization records JSON, I'm

00:29:23.406 --> 00:29:25.176 A:middle
going to deserialize it and pull

00:29:25.176 --> 00:29:27.046 A:middle
out the vaccination code in a

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:28.646 A:middle
system called CVX.

00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:31.006 A:middle
CVX is a commonly used coding

00:29:31.006 --> 00:29:32.646 A:middle
system for immunizations, but

00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:33.856 A:middle
there are many other coding

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:35.256 A:middle
systems for different areas of

00:29:35.256 --> 00:29:35.616 A:middle
medicine.

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.726 A:middle
Finally, I'm going compare the

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:40.286 A:middle
CVX code I found in my

00:29:40.286 --> 00:29:42.486 A:middle
immunization record to a list of

00:29:42.486 --> 00:29:44.676 A:middle
vaccines I know induce immunity

00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:45.546 A:middle
against chickenpox.

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:47.636 A:middle
If there's a match I'll show a

00:29:47.636 --> 00:29:49.726 A:middle
checkmark in my UI next to

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:50.376 A:middle
chickenpox.

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:52.976 A:middle
So let's talk about the

00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:53.946 A:middle
immunization record JSON.

00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.956 A:middle
The structure starts with a

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.806 A:middle
resource type immunization.
