00:10:56.586 --> 00:11:00.766 A:middle
To configure your project you

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:02.626 A:middle
need to add a new health records

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:04.896 A:middle
capability in Xcode after

00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:06.976 A:middle
enabling HealthKit.

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:13.746 A:middle
Then you add the new Health

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:15.326 A:middle
Records Usage Description

00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:16.586 A:middle
purpose string to your

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:17.546 A:middle
Info.plist.

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:22.426 A:middle
Again, this is your opportunity

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:24.426 A:middle
to explain to users why you need

00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:26.036 A:middle
access to this data and what you

00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:27.226 A:middle
will do with it.

00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:31.836 A:middle
Having done this, you can

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:33.096 A:middle
request authorization.

00:11:34.416 --> 00:11:36.986 A:middle
Here I define the types I wish

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:39.036 A:middle
to access, conditions,

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:42.976 A:middle
immunizations, and medications.

00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:48.606 A:middle
And then you can call request

00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:50.206 A:middle
authorization on the Health

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:50.676 A:middle
Store.

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.806 A:middle
Being sure to handle any errors

00:11:54.456 --> 00:11:57.066 A:middle
and after that you're good to

00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:57.496 A:middle
query.

00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:00.496 A:middle
You should be aware that in
