00:30:59.226 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
Here I am in the query for

00:31:00.856 --> 00:31:01.736 A:middle
immunizations method.

00:31:02.776 --> 00:31:04.226 A:middle
When I iterate over my users'

00:31:04.226 --> 00:31:06.086 A:middle
samples I'm going to add a call

00:31:06.086 --> 00:31:06.756 A:middle
to a new method

00:31:07.596 --> 00:31:09.786 A:middle
matchCodedVaccine and I'll pass

00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:10.776 A:middle
it if the sample is FHIR

00:31:10.776 --> 00:31:12.566 A:middle
resource, so let's implement

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:12.866 A:middle
that now.

00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:18.106 A:middle
Here I am in matchCodedVaccine

00:31:18.736 --> 00:31:20.436 A:middle
from resource and what I need to

00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.776 A:middle
do is deserialize the FHIR

00:31:22.776 --> 00:31:24.896 A:middle
resources data, pull out the

00:31:24.896 --> 00:31:26.896 A:middle
vaccination codes, search for

00:31:26.896 --> 00:31:29.416 A:middle
CVX, and compare it against

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:31.946 A:middle
lists of CVX codes for different

00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:32.336 A:middle
diseases.

00:31:32.966 --> 00:31:35.206 A:middle
I have a lot of freedom in how I

00:31:35.206 --> 00:31:37.136 A:middle
choose to deserialize the FHIR

00:31:37.136 --> 00:31:39.256 A:middle
resource, so today I'm going to

00:31:39.256 --> 00:31:40.356 A:middle
use Swift codables.

00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:43.396 A:middle
I need to define a codable for

00:31:43.396 --> 00:31:44.536 A:middle
exactly the keys that I'm

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:45.676 A:middle
interested in.

00:31:47.796 --> 00:31:48.736 A:middle
So I've done that now.

00:31:49.026 --> 00:31:51.276 A:middle
An immunization resource has a

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.896 A:middle
vaccine code, a vaccine code has

00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:57.086 A:middle
an array of codings and a

00:31:57.086 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
vaccine coding has a system and
