00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:00.556 A:middle
predicates to make it easier for

00:26:00.556 --> 00:26:01.356 A:middle
you to work with

00:26:01.356 --> 00:26:02.566 A:middle
HKClinicalRecord.

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.046 A:middle
We have a predicate to allow you

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:08.316 A:middle
to query by resource type, here

00:26:08.396 --> 00:26:10.686 A:middle
I'm looking for prescription or

00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:12.866 A:middle
in FHIR a medication order.

00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:16.766 A:middle
We also have a predicate to

00:26:16.766 --> 00:26:18.716 A:middle
allow you to uniquely identify

00:26:19.206 --> 00:26:20.946 A:middle
records by their source,

00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:23.076 A:middle
resource type and identifier.

00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:25.416 A:middle
This can be incredibly useful as

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:27.066 A:middle
FHIR resources can reference

00:26:27.156 --> 00:26:28.636 A:middle
other FHIR resources.

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:30.926 A:middle
For example, a medication might

00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:32.436 A:middle
reference the condition that it

00:26:32.486 --> 00:26:32.956 A:middle
treats.

00:26:37.116 --> 00:26:38.346 A:middle
Now there are some additional

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:39.686 A:middle
considerations you need to be

00:26:39.686 --> 00:26:41.096 A:middle
aware of when working with FHIR.

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:44.846 A:middle
Firstly, FHIR resources may

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.906 A:middle
contain their own dates.

00:26:47.466 --> 00:26:49.136 A:middle
For example, prescriptions may

00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:50.606 A:middle
contain the order data of that

00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:52.766 A:middle
prescription while a condition

00:26:53.006 --> 00:26:54.766 A:middle
may contain the onset date,

00:26:54.906 --> 00:26:56.626 A:middle
abatement date and the date that

00:26:56.626 --> 00:26:57.986 A:middle
that prescription is first

00:26:57.986 --> 00:26:58.566 A:middle
observed.

00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:01.016 A:middle
You should therefore use the
