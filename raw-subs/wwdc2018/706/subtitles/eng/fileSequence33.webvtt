00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.286 A:middle
So that's an example of solving

00:33:04.286 --> 00:33:05.626 A:middle
a problem using FHIR.

00:33:06.426 --> 00:33:09.346 A:middle
Now for a word on granting

00:33:09.396 --> 00:33:11.226 A:middle
consent for your users I'm going

00:33:11.226 --> 00:33:12.136 A:middle
to hand it back to Jason.

00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:13.586 A:middle
Jason.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Peyton.

00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:25.196 A:middle
So Peyton has shown us how we

00:33:25.196 --> 00:33:27.586 A:middle
can take that rich FHIR data and

00:33:28.076 --> 00:33:29.756 A:middle
take advantage of the coding

00:33:29.756 --> 00:33:31.536 A:middle
that's provided to really

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:33.336 A:middle
provide our users with a very

00:33:33.336 --> 00:33:34.926 A:middle
meaningful and comprehensive

00:33:34.926 --> 00:33:36.256 A:middle
experience around their health

00:33:36.256 --> 00:33:36.806 A:middle
records.

00:33:39.596 --> 00:33:41.736 A:middle
And now I'd like to think a

00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:43.366 A:middle
little bit about how you can

00:33:43.366 --> 00:33:45.506 A:middle
help protect your users' privacy

00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:46.256 A:middle
in this domain.

00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:48.846 A:middle
As you've seen this is

00:33:48.846 --> 00:33:50.446 A:middle
incredibly sensitive data.

00:33:51.716 --> 00:33:53.646 A:middle
We've built privacy in from the

00:33:53.646 --> 00:33:57.166 A:middle
ground up, establishing secure

00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:59.646 A:middle
connections direct to healthcare

00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:00.746 A:middle
institutions.
