00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.066 A:middle
context and allow you to time

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.456 A:middle
those authorization requests.

00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:08.976 A:middle
And with that I'd like to hand

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:10.756 A:middle
over to my colleague Peyton to

00:16:11.026 --> 00:16:12.396 A:middle
see what he can do with this in

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:12.896 A:middle
his app.

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:14.026 A:middle
Thank you.

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:16.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jason.

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:18.846 A:middle
So I'm working on an app for

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.166 A:middle
mountain climbers training for

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:20.906 A:middle
their next summit.

00:16:21.656 --> 00:16:24.036 A:middle
I've got a HealthKit powered

00:16:24.036 --> 00:16:26.436 A:middle
view of all my users walking,

00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:27.686 A:middle
hiking and stairclimbing

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:28.226 A:middle
workouts.

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:31.116 A:middle
Now after extensive market

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.266 A:middle
research, I've determined that

00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:35.156 A:middle
mountain climbers travel to

00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:37.786 A:middle
mountains and travelers should

00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:40.106 A:middle
know their vaccination status.

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:42.096 A:middle
So by the transitive property of

00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:43.746 A:middle
future development mountain

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:45.236 A:middle
climbers should know their

00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:46.466 A:middle
vaccination status.

00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:48.106 A:middle
So I'm going to help out my

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:48.646 A:middle
users.

00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:50.646 A:middle
I've started implementing a new

00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:52.646 A:middle
tab, an immunization dashboard.

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:54.936 A:middle
So let me tap on what I have

00:16:54.936 --> 00:16:55.146 A:middle
now.

00:16:55.696 --> 00:16:58.526 A:middle
Here's my immunization dashboard

00:16:58.526 --> 00:17:00.346 A:middle
and to start out with I'm going
