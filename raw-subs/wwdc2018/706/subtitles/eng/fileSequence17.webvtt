00:16:58.526 --> 00:17:00.346 A:middle
and to start out with I'm going

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:02.216 A:middle
to display my users a list of

00:17:02.216 --> 00:17:04.286 A:middle
their current vaccinations and

00:17:04.286 --> 00:17:05.915 A:middle
I'm going to use the

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:07.376 A:middle
HKClinicalRecords display name

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:07.836 A:middle
property.

00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:09.986 A:middle
I've already added the Health

00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:11.866 A:middle
Records capability to my project

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:14.516 A:middle
and I've created a purpose

00:17:14.516 --> 00:17:16.195 A:middle
string to tell my users how I

00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:17.596 A:middle
plan to use their immunizations.

00:17:18.516 --> 00:17:20.356 A:middle
Now it's time to implement my

00:17:20.356 --> 00:17:20.836 A:middle
dashboard.

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:22.695 A:middle
So here I am at the

00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:24.195 A:middle
ImmunizationsViewController

00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:25.256 A:middle
powering that tab.

00:17:25.976 --> 00:17:27.856 A:middle
In HealthKit it's good practice

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.806 A:middle
to request authorization every

00:17:29.806 --> 00:17:31.486 A:middle
time your user enters the part

00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:33.086 A:middle
of your application using

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:33.496 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.526 A:middle
So for this app viewWillAppear

00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:37.456 A:middle
is a great place.

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:43.156 A:middle
Here I need to first specify

00:17:43.956 --> 00:17:44.776 A:middle
that I'm interested in

00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:46.256 A:middle
immunization record samples.

00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:50.816 A:middle
And next, call my Health Store's

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:52.306 A:middle
requestAuthorization method.

00:17:53.356 --> 00:17:54.786 A:middle
In the callback I'm going to

00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:56.906 A:middle
check for success and handle

00:17:56.906 --> 00:17:57.846 A:middle
errors appropriately.

00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:01.476 A:middle
Finally, once I'm unauthorized
