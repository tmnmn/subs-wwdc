informing them what you do with

00:35:01.676 --> 00:35:01.746 A:middle
it.

00:35:02.376 --> 00:35:03.736 A:middle
This starts with your

00:35:03.736 --> 00:35:05.736 A:middle
application, your purpose

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:08.016 A:middle
string, and your privacy policy

00:35:08.176 --> 00:35:09.916 A:middle
and it continues every step of

00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:12.206 A:middle
the way as you work with that

00:35:12.206 --> 00:35:14.246 A:middle
data and as you move it around.

00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.286 A:middle
For example, you should make

00:35:17.286 --> 00:35:20.836 A:middle
sure you give users details

00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:22.926 A:middle
about how you manage their data.

00:35:23.536 --> 00:35:24.996 A:middle
You should publish clear

00:35:24.996 --> 00:35:27.096 A:middle
retention policies and you

00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:28.496 A:middle
should provide them tools to

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:30.296 A:middle
allow them to delete that data

00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:31.456 A:middle
should they choose to stop

00:35:31.456 --> 00:35:32.436 A:middle
sharing it with you.

00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:36.976 A:middle
And finally, you should make

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:38.786 A:middle
sure that you always request

00:35:39.426 --> 00:35:41.246 A:middle
data proportional to your use

00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:41.776 A:middle
case.

00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:43.906 A:middle
You should never be asking for

00:35:43.906 --> 00:35:44.926 A:middle
more data than you need.

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:50.146 A:middle
I encourage you all to go to the

00:35:50.146 --> 00:35:51.996 A:middle
Privacy Talk, Better Apps

00:35:51.996 --> 00:35:53.386 A:middle

00:35:53.386 --> 00:35:55.706 A:middle

it's a great opportunity to find
