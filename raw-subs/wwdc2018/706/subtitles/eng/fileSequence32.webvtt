00:31:57.086 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
vaccine coding has a system and

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:02.426 A:middle
a code.

00:32:02.636 --> 00:32:05.836 A:middle
With that I instantiate a JSON

00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:08.436 A:middle
decoder and I use it to decode

00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:10.376 A:middle
the FHIR resources data as an

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:11.746 A:middle
immunization resource.

00:32:12.276 --> 00:32:16.046 A:middle
All that's left is to iterate

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:19.396 A:middle
over each coding, check to see

00:32:19.396 --> 00:32:23.846 A:middle
whether the system is CVX, and

00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:26.296 A:middle
then pass the code to this

00:32:26.296 --> 00:32:27.916 A:middle
method to mark it in the data

00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:28.266 A:middle
source.

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.776 A:middle
All this method does is compares

00:32:30.776 --> 00:32:32.976 A:middle
the code against lists of codes

00:32:33.046 --> 00:32:34.806 A:middle
per disease and if there's a

00:32:34.806 --> 00:32:38.026 A:middle
match marks in the UI that

00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:41.196 A:middle
disease for the found disease.

00:32:41.766 --> 00:32:44.176 A:middle
So with that I'm going to build

00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:45.916 A:middle
and run and take a look at my

00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:46.936 A:middle
immunization checklist.

00:32:47.956 --> 00:32:49.436 A:middle
So here I am on my training log,

00:32:50.026 --> 00:32:50.866 A:middle
I'm going to tap on the

00:32:50.866 --> 00:32:53.746 A:middle
Immunizations tab and just like

00:32:53.746 --> 00:32:55.546 A:middle
that with a few lines of code I

00:32:55.546 --> 00:32:56.816 A:middle
have an immunization checklist.

00:32:57.516 --> 00:33:02.316 A:middle
