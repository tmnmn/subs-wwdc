If you're not familiar with

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:04.206 A:middle
working with samples in

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:06.376 A:middle
HealthKit we have a number of

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:08.006 A:middle
talks that cover this topic and

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
I'll provide details of these at

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:11.026 A:middle
the end.

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:14.636 A:middle
There are a few key properties

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:16.066 A:middle
you'll be working with on

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.426 A:middle
HKClinicalRecord.

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:21.476 A:middle
The clinical type, we looked at

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:23.466 A:middle
this earlier and this allows you

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:25.996 A:middle
to determine the type of a given

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:26.726 A:middle
record.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.936 A:middle
I want to know that a health

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:31.146 A:middle
record is for example an

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:31.936 A:middle
immunization.

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:36.866 A:middle
We provide a display name which

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:38.566 A:middle
is a string that we use when

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:40.496 A:middle
showing that health record to

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:41.446 A:middle
users in Health.

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:43.976 A:middle
It's selected from the FHIR

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.466 A:middle
resource and it's your

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.006 A:middle
opportunity to tie back your

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:48.876 A:middle
app's experience to something

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.086 A:middle
users are familiar with.

00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:54.616 A:middle
You can see in this lab result

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:56.556 A:middle
that there are a number of

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.776 A:middle
alternative representations and

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:02.296 A:middle
names, including a coding in the
