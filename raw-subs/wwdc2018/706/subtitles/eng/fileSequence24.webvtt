00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:01.976 A:middle
records or to relate specific

00:24:01.976 --> 00:24:03.426 A:middle
things across multiple

00:24:03.426 --> 00:24:04.826 A:middle
healthcare institutions.

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:09.496 A:middle
Here we're actually looking at a

00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:12.196 A:middle
category coding which tells us

00:24:12.196 --> 00:24:13.506 A:middle
that this is a lab result.

00:24:15.816 --> 00:24:18.056 A:middle
There's also a code in the case

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.706 A:middle
of an observation for what is

00:24:19.746 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
being measured.

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:25.376 A:middle
This is blood glucose as defined

00:24:25.636 --> 00:24:27.806 A:middle
in the LOINC coding system and

00:24:27.806 --> 00:24:29.266 A:middle
it could take that code and look

00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:31.316 A:middle
it up in the LOINC database for

00:24:31.316 --> 00:24:32.956 A:middle
alternative names and further

00:24:32.956 --> 00:24:33.526 A:middle
information.

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:38.216 A:middle
And of course this is an

00:24:38.216 --> 00:24:39.966 A:middle
observation so I have the value

00:24:39.966 --> 00:24:41.076 A:middle
that is observed.

00:24:41.386 --> 00:24:42.786 A:middle
This is 60 milligrams per

00:24:42.786 --> 00:24:44.676 A:middle
deciliter and you'll note that

00:24:44.676 --> 00:24:46.376 A:middle
even the units here are coded,

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:48.286 A:middle
so I have a really comprehensive

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:49.816 A:middle
understanding about what's going

00:24:49.816 --> 00:24:49.976 A:middle
on.

00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:56.376 A:middle
FHIR resources have many

00:24:56.376 --> 00:24:59.586 A:middle
additional data elements and I

00:24:59.586 --> 00:25:01.036 A:middle
encourage you to go and look at
