this rich data format.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:04.586 A:middle
Users interact with multiple

00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
healthcare institutions over the

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.446 A:middle
course of their lives and these

00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:10.526 A:middle
are often running different

00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:12.446 A:middle
electronic health record systems

00:21:13.326 --> 00:21:15.856 A:middle
that don't always represent data

00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:16.936 A:middle
in the same way.

00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:19.426 A:middle
This makes interoperability

00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:20.536 A:middle
incredibly difficult.

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:25.016 A:middle
So to address this the

00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:26.516 A:middle
healthcare community came

00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:27.996 A:middle
together in an effort called the

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.626 A:middle
Argonaut Project, this uses

00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:33.076 A:middle
FHIR, a flexible JSON

00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:36.556 A:middle
representation of health records

00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:38.416 A:middle
and [inaudible] 2 as defined by

00:21:38.416 --> 00:21:40.936 A:middle
the Smart Authorization Guide to

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:43.646 A:middle
allow connections, consistent

00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:45.196 A:middle
connections to healthcare

00:21:45.196 --> 00:21:47.256 A:middle
institutions and to allow data

00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:49.016 A:middle
to be downloaded in a common

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.676 A:middle
format and related across those

00:21:51.676 --> 00:21:53.046 A:middle
multiple institutions.

00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:58.826 A:middle
FHIR itself models a huge

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:01.556 A:middle
universe of health data from
