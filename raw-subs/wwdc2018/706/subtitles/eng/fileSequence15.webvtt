00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:02.056 A:middle
You should be sure to use this

00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:05.006 A:middle
judiciously and try not to limit

00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:06.896 A:middle
your app's functionality based

00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:08.826 A:middle
on the data that you have access

00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:09.086 A:middle
to.

00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:11.466 A:middle
You really want to make sure as

00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:13.196 A:middle
many users as possible can

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:14.406 A:middle
benefit from your app

00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:16.326 A:middle
irrespective of how much data

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:16.976 A:middle
they choose to share.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.546 A:middle
So that's the full authorization

00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:25.536 A:middle
flow and there's just a couple

00:15:25.536 --> 00:15:27.116 A:middle
of points I'd like to focus on.

00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:30.966 A:middle
Firstly, you should be sure to

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.746 A:middle
request authorization each and

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.316 A:middle
every time that you need access

00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:37.296 A:middle
to data, especially now because

00:15:37.296 --> 00:15:39.456 A:middle
users may want to see that sheet

00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:41.386 A:middle
every time when new data comes

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:44.106 A:middle
in we may need to present a

00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:45.756 A:middle
sheet when you need to query.

00:15:48.106 --> 00:15:49.346 A:middle
You should also be sure to

00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:51.356 A:middle
request only access to the data

00:15:51.356 --> 00:15:52.166 A:middle
that you need.

00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:56.266 A:middle
And finally, you should consider

00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:58.356 A:middle
taking advantage of the new APIs

00:15:58.736 --> 00:15:59.906 A:middle
to provide users with better

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.066 A:middle
context and allow you to time
