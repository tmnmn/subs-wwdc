00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:01.476 A:middle
Finally, once I'm unauthorized

00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:03.376 A:middle
I'm going to call this query for

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.726 A:middle
immunizations method which I'll

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:06.576 A:middle
implement now.

00:18:06.806 --> 00:18:08.466 A:middle
Here in query for immunizations

00:18:08.716 --> 00:18:09.946 A:middle
I'm going to create a sample

00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:12.046 A:middle
query, I'm going to iterate over

00:18:12.046 --> 00:18:13.656 A:middle
all the return samples, and I'm

00:18:13.656 --> 00:18:15.346 A:middle
going to pass each sample's

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:16.916 A:middle
display name to my data source.

00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:17.976 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:18:22.116 --> 00:18:23.666 A:middle
Here I've got my sample query

00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:25.716 A:middle
and I'm using the humanization

00:18:25.716 --> 00:18:27.246 A:middle
record sample type.

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:30.686 A:middle
No predicate because I want all

00:18:30.686 --> 00:18:32.656 A:middle
of the users' immunizations and

00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:35.316 A:middle
similarly no limit because I

00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:36.636 A:middle
want to get all of my users'

00:18:36.936 --> 00:18:37.526 A:middle
immunizations.

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:40.266 A:middle
No sort descriptors, it doesn't

00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:41.856 A:middle
matter to me in what order these

00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:42.616 A:middle
samples are returned.

00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:45.916 A:middle
And with that I'm going to check

00:18:46.256 --> 00:18:48.556 A:middle
for results and if not handle

00:18:48.556 --> 00:18:49.426 A:middle
errors appropriately.

00:18:50.806 --> 00:18:52.936 A:middle
Next, I'm going to iterate over

00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:55.216 A:middle
the samples and I'll pass them

00:18:55.446 --> 00:18:57.396 A:middle
to my data source by display

00:18:57.966 --> 00:18:58.056 A:middle
name.
