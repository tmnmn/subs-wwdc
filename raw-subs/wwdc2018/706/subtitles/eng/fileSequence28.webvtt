00:27:57.396 --> 00:28:00.116 A:middle
access to this information Swift

00:28:00.116 --> 00:28:01.856 A:middle
codable and JSON serialization

00:28:02.006 --> 00:28:03.576 A:middle
may not be appropriate tools.

00:28:04.596 --> 00:28:06.646 A:middle
And with that, I'd love to hand

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:08.496 A:middle
back to Peyton and see what

00:28:08.496 --> 00:28:10.376 A:middle
wonderful things he can do with

00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:10.976 A:middle
this new API.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:18.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:19.106 --> 00:28:19.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jason.

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:21.896 A:middle
So back to the immunization

00:28:21.896 --> 00:28:23.186 A:middle
dashboard I've been working on.

00:28:23.726 --> 00:28:25.526 A:middle
I'm using HealthKit to fetch my

00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:27.316 A:middle
users' vaccinations, but right

00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:28.826 A:middle
now it's tough for a user to

00:28:28.826 --> 00:28:30.696 A:middle
tell what vaccinations they have

00:28:30.766 --> 00:28:31.846 A:middle
and what they might need to get.

00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:34.616 A:middle
So I'm going to solve that by

00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:36.436 A:middle
implementing an immunization

00:28:36.656 --> 00:28:37.346 A:middle
checklist.

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.466 A:middle
Users can see a summary of their

00:28:39.466 --> 00:28:41.706 A:middle
immunizations in plain language.

00:28:43.126 --> 00:28:44.816 A:middle
To populate this list I need to

00:28:44.816 --> 00:28:46.016 A:middle
know that this combination

00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:48.516 A:middle
vaccine induces immunity against

00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:51.136 A:middle
chickenpox and against MMR.

00:28:51.756 --> 00:28:54.016 A:middle
Health institutions speak

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:55.926 A:middle
different languages so I can't

00:28:55.926 --> 00:28:58.596 A:middle
rely on name alone, so that's

00:28:58.596 --> 00:28:59.806 A:middle
where the interoperability of

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:00.856 A:middle
FHIR comes into play.
