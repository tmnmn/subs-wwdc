00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:02.116 A:middle
With the names in my data source

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:03.816 A:middle
it's time to head out to the

00:19:03.816 --> 00:19:06.536 A:middle
main queue and call this reload

00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:08.456 A:middle
UI method that I wrote earlier.

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.766 A:middle
Finally, I'm going to execute my

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:14.306 A:middle
sample query on my Health Store

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:15.976 A:middle
and that's all it takes, so

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:16.976 A:middle
let's build and run.

00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:22.336 A:middle
So here I have my training log,

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:23.636 A:middle
I'm going to tap on my

00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:24.916 A:middle
immunization dashboard tab.

00:19:25.366 --> 00:19:26.686 A:middle
I see the new Health Records

00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:28.776 A:middle
authorization sheet explaining

00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:31.276 A:middle
to my users how my app could

00:19:31.446 --> 00:19:33.546 A:middle
potentially use my users' health

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:33.896 A:middle
records.

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:37.306 A:middle
I'm going to tap continue and

00:19:37.306 --> 00:19:39.596 A:middle
here my user has a chance to

00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:41.686 A:middle
allow or deny categories as they

00:19:41.686 --> 00:19:42.156 A:middle
see fit.

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:44.536 A:middle
There is my purpose string that

00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:45.976 A:middle
I defined in my Info.plist

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.796 A:middle
earlier alongside a link to my

00:19:47.796 --> 00:19:48.956 A:middle
app's privacy policy.

00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:51.836 A:middle
Now users have to explicitly

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.556 A:middle
switch for every single

00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:55.776 A:middle
category, there's no turn on all

00:19:55.776 --> 00:19:56.166 A:middle
button.

00:19:57.256 --> 00:19:59.306 A:middle
So for the purposes of the demo

00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
I'm going to enable
