00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:02.296 A:middle
names, including a coding in the

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.826 A:middle
LOINC coding system.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.476 A:middle
This is an industry standard

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
reference for medical

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.086 A:middle
information and it is required

00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:10.806 A:middle
by FHIR for observations.

00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:14.336 A:middle
You can see here that we've

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:16.366 A:middle
taken that LOINC coding and

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:18.396 A:middle
performed a lookup to provide a

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.126 A:middle
canonical name which we will

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.806 A:middle
surface to you as the display

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:21.976 A:middle
name.

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:27.426 A:middle
And finally, we provide access

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:29.646 A:middle
to the full FHIR resource, but

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:30.946 A:middle
there's a lot you can benefit

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:32.106 A:middle
from looking at the

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:33.756 A:middle
HKClinicalRecord so I'm going to

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:35.626 A:middle
set this aside right now and we

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:36.736 A:middle
can come back to it later.

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:42.696 A:middle
Like all of Health data,

00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:45.236 A:middle
provenance, or the source of

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:47.396 A:middle
that data, is very important.

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:50.086 A:middle
You want to know where this

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:51.406 A:middle
health record comes from.

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:54.106 A:middle
And as with the rest of

00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:56.326 A:middle
HealthKit we model this using

00:06:56.326 --> 00:06:58.606 A:middle
HKSource which is available on

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.366 A:middle
the HKSample superclass.
