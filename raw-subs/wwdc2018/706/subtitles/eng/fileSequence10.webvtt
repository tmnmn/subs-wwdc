00:09:57.566 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
And finally because data can

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.366 A:middle
change over time as a user

00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:03.856 A:middle
interacts with their healthcare

00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:06.966 A:middle
institution, we're introducing a

00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:09.526 A:middle
new way to control how new data

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.296 A:middle
is shared with your app.

00:10:11.796 --> 00:10:13.886 A:middle
We default to asking before

00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:16.216 A:middle
sharing new data each and every

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:16.646 A:middle
time.

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:19.546 A:middle
This means we may need to

00:10:19.546 --> 00:10:21.796 A:middle
present the new permission sheet

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:24.346 A:middle
whenever new data is available.

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:27.266 A:middle
So when you need to query for

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:29.016 A:middle
data you should always request

00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:30.846 A:middle
authorization prior to doing so.

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.456 A:middle
Okay, so how do I get started

00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:39.046 A:middle
and request authorization?

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:42.106 A:middle
This flow is going to look very

00:10:42.106 --> 00:10:43.406 A:middle
familiar to those of you who've

00:10:43.406 --> 00:10:44.836 A:middle
worked with HealthKit before.

00:10:45.756 --> 00:10:48.416 A:middle
First, I need to configure the

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:49.906 A:middle
project.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.156 A:middle
After that request

00:10:52.156 --> 00:10:53.036 A:middle
authorization.

00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:55.976 A:middle
And finally query for data.

00:10:56.586 --> 00:11:00.766 A:middle
To configure your project you
