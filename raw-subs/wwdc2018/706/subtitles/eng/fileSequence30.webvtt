00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.806 A:middle
resource type immunization.

00:30:02.316 --> 00:30:05.966 A:middle
There's a vaccine code object

00:30:07.356 --> 00:30:08.996 A:middle
and contained therein is an

00:30:08.996 --> 00:30:09.986 A:middle
array of codings.

00:30:10.506 --> 00:30:12.566 A:middle
There may be multiple codings,

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:16.556 A:middle
so I need to search by system to

00:30:16.556 --> 00:30:17.526 A:middle
find CVX.

00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:19.616 A:middle
In this example, the first

00:30:19.616 --> 00:30:23.186 A:middle
system is NDC so I move until I

00:30:23.186 --> 00:30:24.076 A:middle
see CVX.

00:30:25.086 --> 00:30:27.026 A:middle
With that in hand I look at the

00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:29.906 A:middle
code and I look it up and I see

00:30:29.906 --> 00:30:30.916 A:middle
that I have MMRV.

00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:34.886 A:middle
So that's the structure of these

00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:36.176 A:middle
immunization records JSON.

00:30:37.026 --> 00:30:38.906 A:middle
Now it's time to implement.

00:30:39.856 --> 00:30:41.646 A:middle
So here we are back in my

00:30:41.646 --> 00:30:42.956 A:middle
immunizations view controller.

00:30:43.676 --> 00:30:44.796 A:middle
I've done some work ahead of

00:30:44.796 --> 00:30:47.156 A:middle
time to implement the UI of the

00:30:47.156 --> 00:30:50.766 A:middle
checklist and I instantiate it

00:30:51.046 --> 00:30:52.596 A:middle
with a showChecklist property.

00:30:52.596 --> 00:30:57.076 A:middle
Now it's time to populate my

00:30:57.076 --> 00:30:57.826 A:middle
checklist with data.

00:30:59.226 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
Here I am in the query for
