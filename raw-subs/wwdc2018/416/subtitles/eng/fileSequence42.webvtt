00:41:59.946 --> 00:42:01.466 A:middle
this would not fly on a device

00:42:01.466 --> 00:42:02.006 A:middle
at all.

00:42:02.336 --> 00:42:03.186 A:middle
So when you're running in the

00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:04.586 A:middle
simulator, you have to remember

00:42:04.586 --> 00:42:06.036 A:middle
that it's useful for debugging

00:42:06.036 --> 00:42:07.226 A:middle
and testing changes, but you

00:42:07.226 --> 00:42:08.706 A:middle
need to validate all that stuff

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:09.796 A:middle
on devices as well.

00:42:09.796 --> 00:42:11.206 A:middle
But the other thing that's nice

00:42:11.206 --> 00:42:13.116 A:middle
is the simulator is never going

00:42:13.116 --> 00:42:13.976 A:middle
to run out of memory.

00:42:14.276 --> 00:42:15.616 A:middle
So if I have a case where my app

00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:16.736 A:middle
is getting shut down on a

00:42:16.736 --> 00:42:18.116 A:middle
device, maybe try it in the

00:42:18.116 --> 00:42:18.876 A:middle
simulator.

00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:20.296 A:middle
I could see what's, you know, I

00:42:20.296 --> 00:42:21.836 A:middle
can wait for a really big

00:42:21.836 --> 00:42:23.476 A:middle
allocation, not get shut down,

00:42:23.476 --> 00:42:24.616 A:middle
and then investigate it from

00:42:24.616 --> 00:42:24.946 A:middle
there.

00:42:25.666 --> 00:42:26.716 A:middle
And one thing I would like to

00:42:26.716 --> 00:42:28.786 A:middle
point out is actually we do show

00:42:28.786 --> 00:42:30.526 A:middle
you the high-water mark over

00:42:31.046 --> 00:42:31.336 A:middle
here.

00:42:31.336 --> 00:42:33.786 A:middle
And in this case, I'm up to 7.7

00:42:33.786 --> 00:42:34.406 A:middle
gigabytes.

00:42:35.226 --> 00:42:35.816 A:middle
It's terrible.

00:42:36.636 --> 00:42:38.616 A:middle
So let's see what we can do

00:42:38.616 --> 00:42:39.126 A:middle
about that.

00:42:39.226 --> 00:42:42.286 A:middle
I'm going to go back to my apply

00:42:43.176 --> 00:42:43.706 A:middle
function.

00:42:44.326 --> 00:42:46.386 A:middle
And now, you know, I do want to

00:42:46.386 --> 00:42:47.026 A:middle
come back to this

00:42:47.026 --> 00:42:48.396 A:middle
beginImageContext WithOptions

00:42:48.396 --> 00:42:50.086 A:middle
thing, but thinking back to what

00:42:50.086 --> 00:42:52.046 A:middle
Kyle said, when you're dealing

00:42:52.046 --> 00:42:54.296 A:middle
with images, what's the most

00:42:54.296 --> 00:42:55.466 A:middle
important thing in terms of

00:42:55.466 --> 00:42:56.236 A:middle
memory use?

00:42:56.696 --> 00:42:58.986 A:middle
It's the image size, so let's

00:42:58.986 --> 00:43:00.236 A:middle
take a look at what that looks
