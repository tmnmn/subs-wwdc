00:47:59.136 --> 00:48:00.206 A:middle
it turns out that's, if you

00:48:00.206 --> 00:48:01.216 A:middle
think about it, that's what I

00:48:01.216 --> 00:48:01.666 A:middle
expect.

00:48:02.216 --> 00:48:03.496 A:middle
My image is still going to be

00:48:03.496 --> 00:48:05.346 A:middle
using, in this circumstance, 4

00:48:05.346 --> 00:48:07.006 A:middle
bytes per pixel, so I'm not

00:48:07.006 --> 00:48:08.076 A:middle
actually getting any memory

00:48:08.076 --> 00:48:10.006 A:middle
savings by using this new

00:48:10.006 --> 00:48:10.476 A:middle
method.

00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:12.176 A:middle
However, if there was an

00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:13.926 A:middle
opportunity for memory savings

00:48:14.406 --> 00:48:16.006 A:middle
-- for example, you know, if the

00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:17.356 A:middle
operating system could determine

00:48:17.356 --> 00:48:18.956 A:middle
that it could use fewer bytes

00:48:18.956 --> 00:48:20.666 A:middle
per pixel or if it determined

00:48:20.666 --> 00:48:21.866 A:middle
that it needed to use more, it

00:48:21.866 --> 00:48:23.156 A:middle
would do the right thing, and I

00:48:23.156 --> 00:48:24.206 A:middle
don't need to worry about it.

00:48:24.546 --> 00:48:25.886 A:middle
So even though I don't see a big

00:48:25.886 --> 00:48:27.446 A:middle
improvement, I know my code is

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:28.636 A:middle
still better for having made

00:48:28.636 --> 00:48:29.486 A:middle
these changes.

00:48:30.526 --> 00:48:32.546 A:middle
So there's still more I could do

00:48:32.546 --> 00:48:33.246 A:middle
here, right.

00:48:33.566 --> 00:48:34.756 A:middle
I want to make sure we unload

00:48:34.756 --> 00:48:35.956 A:middle
the image when the app goes into

00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:37.686 A:middle
the background, and I want to

00:48:37.686 --> 00:48:39.536 A:middle
make sure we're not showing any

00:48:39.536 --> 00:48:40.806 A:middle
images in views that aren't on

00:48:40.806 --> 00:48:41.346 A:middle
screen.

00:48:41.346 --> 00:48:42.286 A:middle
There's a lot more I can do

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:44.026 A:middle
here, but I'm really pleased

00:48:44.026 --> 00:48:45.516 A:middle
with these results, and I want

00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:46.896 A:middle
to send them back to James.

00:48:47.156 --> 00:48:48.416 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:48:48.416 --> 00:48:50.096 A:middle
grab a screenshot and add a

00:48:50.096 --> 00:48:53.236 A:middle
little note to it for James just

00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:54.886 A:middle
to show him how pleased I am

00:48:54.886 --> 00:48:55.716 A:middle
with all of this.

00:48:56.286 --> 00:48:57.476 A:middle
And I think we're going to go

00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:59.466 A:middle
ahead and send him the
