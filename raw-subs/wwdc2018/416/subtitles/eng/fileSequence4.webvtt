00:03:55.726 --> 00:04:00.876 A:middle
can actually make it dirty.

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:03.146 A:middle
Dirty memory is any memory that

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:04.556 A:middle
has been written to by your app.

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:07.516 A:middle
Now, these can be objects,

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.016 A:middle
anything that has been malloced

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.416 A:middle
-- strings, arrays, et cetera.

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:14.186 A:middle
It can be decoded image buffers,

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:15.426 A:middle
which we'll talk about in a bit.

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:18.576 A:middle
And it can also be frameworks.

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:21.196 A:middle
Frameworks have a data section

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:23.136 A:middle
and a data dirty section as

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:23.356 A:middle
well.

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:25.226 A:middle
Now, those are always going to

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:26.786 A:middle
count towards dirty memory.

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.216 A:middle
And if you might have noticed, I

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:30.446 A:middle
brought up frameworks twice.

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:32.486 A:middle
Yes, frameworks that you link

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:34.976 A:middle
actually use memory and dirty

00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:35.286 A:middle
memory.

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:36.976 A:middle
Now, this is just a necessary

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.066 A:middle
part of linking frameworks, but

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:39.756 A:middle
if you maintain your own

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:41.776 A:middle
framework, singletons and global

00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:43.726 A:middle
initializers are a great way to

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:45.256 A:middle
reduce the amount of dirty

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:46.786 A:middle
memory they use because a

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.146 A:middle
singleton's always going to be

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:49.246 A:middle
in memory after it's been

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:51.376 A:middle
created, and these initializers

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:52.696 A:middle
are also run whenever the

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:53.766 A:middle
framework is linked or the class

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:53.976 A:middle
is loaded.

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:59.546 A:middle
Now, compressed memory is pretty
