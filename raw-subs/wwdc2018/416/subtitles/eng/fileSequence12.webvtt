00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:00.786 A:middle
and swap that's really important

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:00.956 A:middle
here.

00:12:02.016 --> 00:12:03.646 A:middle
One important point of note is

00:12:03.646 --> 00:12:05.066 A:middle
the swap size gives you the

00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:07.486 A:middle
precompressed size of your data,

00:12:07.486 --> 00:12:08.746 A:middle
not what it compressed down to.

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:11.686 A:middle
If you really need to dig deeper

00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:13.186 A:middle
and you want more information,

00:12:13.546 --> 00:12:14.956 A:middle
you can just run vmmap against

00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:16.186 A:middle
the Memgraph , and you'll get

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:17.786 A:middle
contents of all of the regions.

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:19.606 A:middle
So we'll start by printing you

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:20.686 A:middle
the nonwritable region, so,

00:12:20.686 --> 00:12:22.156 A:middle
like, your program's text or

00:12:22.156 --> 00:12:24.536 A:middle
executable code, and then the

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.156 A:middle
writable regions, so the data

00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
sections, for instance.

00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:28.786 A:middle
This is where your process heap

00:12:29.286 --> 00:12:30.436 A:middle
will be.

00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:31.986 A:middle
One really cool aside to all of

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:33.456 A:middle
this is that all these tools

00:12:33.456 --> 00:12:34.836 A:middle
work really well with standard

00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:35.976 A:middle
command-line utilities.

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:38.286 A:middle
So for example, I was profiling

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:39.356 A:middle
my app in VM Tracker the other

00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:41.506 A:middle
day, and I saw the, an increase

00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:42.526 A:middle
in the amount of dirty memory.

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:45.316 A:middle
So I took a Memgraph, and I want

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:48.036 A:middle
to find out, are any frameworks

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:49.166 A:middle
or libraries I'm linking to

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:52.076 A:middle
contributing to this dirty data?

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:54.216 A:middle
So here I've run vmmap against

00:12:54.216 --> 00:12:55.296 A:middle
the Memgraph I took.

00:12:56.296 --> 00:12:58.456 A:middle
And I've used the pages flag.

00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:00.206 A:middle
This means that vmmap will print
