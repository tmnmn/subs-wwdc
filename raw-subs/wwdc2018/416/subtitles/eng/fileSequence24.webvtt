00:23:58.706 --> 00:24:00.376 A:middle
notification or go to a

00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:01.316 A:middle
different app.

00:24:01.986 --> 00:24:03.586 A:middle
That image is still in memory.

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:06.806 A:middle
So as a good rule of thumb, we

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:08.486 A:middle
recommend unloading large

00:24:08.486 --> 00:24:09.826 A:middle
resources you cannot see.

00:24:10.276 --> 00:24:13.756 A:middle
There are 2 ways to do this.

00:24:13.986 --> 00:24:15.246 A:middle
The first is the app life cycle.

00:24:15.296 --> 00:24:16.466 A:middle
So if you background your app or

00:24:16.466 --> 00:24:17.656 A:middle
foreground it, the app life

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
cycle events are great to, are a

00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:20.736 A:middle
great way to know.

00:24:21.686 --> 00:24:22.926 A:middle
Now, this applies to mostly the

00:24:22.926 --> 00:24:24.486 A:middle
on-screen views because those

00:24:24.536 --> 00:24:25.316 A:middle
don't conform to the

00:24:25.316 --> 00:24:26.796 A:middle
UIViewController appearance life

00:24:26.796 --> 00:24:27.106 A:middle
cycle.

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:28.886 A:middle
UIViewController methods are

00:24:28.886 --> 00:24:30.576 A:middle
great for, like, tab controllers

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:32.526 A:middle
or navigation controllers

00:24:32.526 --> 00:24:33.306 A:middle
because you're going to have

00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:34.446 A:middle
multiple view controllers, but

00:24:34.446 --> 00:24:35.676 A:middle
only 1 of them is on screen at

00:24:35.676 --> 00:24:36.066 A:middle
once.

00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:37.486 A:middle
So if you leverage like the

00:24:37.486 --> 00:24:38.296 A:middle
viewWillAppear and

00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:39.946 A:middle
viewDidDisappear code or

00:24:40.176 --> 00:24:41.516 A:middle
callbacks, you can keep your

00:24:41.726 --> 00:24:42.766 A:middle
memory footprint smaller.

00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:46.476 A:middle
Now, as an example, if I

00:24:46.476 --> 00:24:48.246 A:middle
register for the notifications

00:24:48.246 --> 00:24:49.466 A:middle
for the application entering the

00:24:49.566 --> 00:24:50.916 A:middle
background, I can unload my

00:24:50.916 --> 00:24:52.296 A:middle
large assets -- in this case,

00:24:52.296 --> 00:24:52.726 A:middle
images.

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:54.696 A:middle
When the app comes back to the

00:24:54.696 --> 00:24:56.016 A:middle
foreground, I get a notification

00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:56.786 A:middle
for that.

00:24:57.556 --> 00:24:59.686 A:middle
If I reload my images there, I'm

00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
saving memory when in the
