00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:00.926 A:middle
large an instance is?

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:03.366 A:middle
If malloc stack logging was

00:17:03.366 --> 00:17:05.046 A:middle
enabled when you record, when

00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:06.185 A:middle
you, when your process was

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:08.175 A:middle
started, malloc history can help

00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:09.146 A:middle
you find the backtrace for that

00:17:09.146 --> 00:17:09.455 A:middle
object.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:11.646 A:middle
If you just want to see what

00:17:11.646 --> 00:17:12.896 A:middle
references an object in memory,

00:17:13.486 --> 00:17:15.576 A:middle
you can use leaks and a bunch of

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:16.766 A:middle
options that it has in the

00:17:16.766 --> 00:17:17.715 A:middle
[inaudible] page to help you

00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:17.915 A:middle
there.

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:20.366 A:middle
And finally, if you just want to

00:17:20.366 --> 00:17:21.435 A:middle
see how large a region or an

00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:23.296 A:middle
instance is, vmmap and heap are

00:17:23.296 --> 00:17:24.056 A:middle
the go-to tools.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.006 A:middle
As a jumping off point, I'd

00:17:26.006 --> 00:17:27.376 A:middle
recommend just running vmmap

00:17:27.376 --> 00:17:29.126 A:middle
with the summary flag against a

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:30.436 A:middle
Memgraph taken of your process

00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:31.746 A:middle
and then follow the thread down

00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:34.096 A:middle
there.

00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:34.916 A:middle
Now, I'd like to hand back to

00:17:34.916 --> 00:17:36.286 A:middle
Kyle, who's going to talk about

00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:37.736 A:middle
what can be some of the largest

00:17:37.736 --> 00:17:39.446 A:middle
objects in iOS apps, and that's

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:39.936 A:middle
images.

00:17:40.646 --> 00:17:40.856 A:middle
Kyle?

00:17:42.516 --> 00:17:45.856 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:46.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, James.

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.486 A:middle
So images.

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:51.586 A:middle
The most important thing about

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:54.296 A:middle
images to remember is that the

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:55.506 A:middle
memory use is related to the

00:17:55.506 --> 00:17:57.916 A:middle
dimensions of the image, not its

00:17:57.916 --> 00:17:58.536 A:middle
file size.

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.846 A:middle
As an example, I have this
