00:02:57.746 --> 00:03:00.026 A:middle
So a good example of this would

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:01.266 A:middle
be a JPEG.

00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:03.036 A:middle
If I have a JPEG that's, say, 50

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.586 A:middle
kilobytes of size, when it's

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.416 A:middle
memory mapped in, that actually

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.746 A:middle
is mapped into four pages of

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:10.576 A:middle
memory, give or take.

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:12.436 A:middle
Now, the fourth page is actually

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.936 A:middle
not completely full, so it can

00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:14.876 A:middle
be used for other things.

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:16.446 A:middle
Memory's a little bit tricky

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:16.846 A:middle
like that.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.376 A:middle
But those three pages before

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:21.306 A:middle
will always be purgeable by the

00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:21.736 A:middle
system.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:26.156 A:middle
And when we talk about a typical

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.366 A:middle
app, their footprint and profile

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:30.146 A:middle
has a dirty, a compressed, and a

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:31.166 A:middle
clean segment of memory.

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:32.926 A:middle
Let's break these down.

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:37.156 A:middle
So clean memory is data that can

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:37.826 A:middle
be paged out.

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:39.666 A:middle
Now, these are the memory-mapped

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:40.676 A:middle
files we just talked about.

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:43.216 A:middle
Could be images, data Blobs,

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:44.376 A:middle
training models.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:47.126 A:middle
They can also be frameworks.

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:50.566 A:middle
So every framework has a DATA

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:51.486 A:middle
CONST section.

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:53.466 A:middle
Now, this is typically clean,

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.406 A:middle
but if you do any runtime

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:55.726 A:middle
shenanigans like swizzling, that

00:03:55.726 --> 00:04:00.876 A:middle
can actually make it dirty.
