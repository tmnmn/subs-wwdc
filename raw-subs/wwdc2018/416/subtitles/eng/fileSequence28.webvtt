00:27:59.266 --> 00:28:03.496 A:middle
And I have a couple go-to tricks

00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:06.686 A:middle
that I use when working with a

00:28:06.686 --> 00:28:08.216 A:middle
Memgraph file or go-to

00:28:08.216 --> 00:28:08.946 A:middle
strategies.

00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:10.756 A:middle
And the first -- actually, let

00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:12.636 A:middle
me bring this up a little bit --

00:28:13.076 --> 00:28:14.846 A:middle
is to look for leaks.

00:28:15.406 --> 00:28:18.286 A:middle
So if I go down to the Filter

00:28:18.286 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
toolbar and click on the leaks

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:22.106 A:middle
filter, that'll show me just any

00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:23.386 A:middle
leaks that are in my Memgraph

00:28:23.386 --> 00:28:23.736 A:middle
file.

00:28:24.666 --> 00:28:27.076 A:middle
Turns out this Memgraph file has

00:28:27.076 --> 00:28:27.746 A:middle
no leaks.

00:28:27.986 --> 00:28:29.526 A:middle
Well, that's both kind of good

00:28:29.526 --> 00:28:30.656 A:middle
news and bad news.

00:28:31.136 --> 00:28:32.136 A:middle
It's great that there are no

00:28:32.136 --> 00:28:33.516 A:middle
leaks, but now I have to figure

00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:34.826 A:middle
out what's actually going on

00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:35.046 A:middle
here.

00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:37.746 A:middle
The other thing that Memgraph is

00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:40.046 A:middle
really good for is showing me

00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:41.926 A:middle
how many instances of an object

00:28:41.926 --> 00:28:43.036 A:middle
are in memory and if there's

00:28:43.036 --> 00:28:44.226 A:middle
more than I expect.

00:28:44.876 --> 00:28:46.166 A:middle
But if I look at this Memgraph,

00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:47.476 A:middle
I can see if I actually just

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:49.136 A:middle
focus specifically on the

00:28:49.136 --> 00:28:52.146 A:middle
objects from my code, there's

00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:53.966 A:middle
only 5 in memory, and there's

00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:55.156 A:middle
actually only 1 of each of

00:28:55.156 --> 00:28:55.526 A:middle
these.

00:28:56.136 --> 00:28:57.266 A:middle
If there were, you know,

00:28:57.266 --> 00:28:59.066 A:middle
multiple root view controllers,

00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:01.586 A:middle
or multiple noir filters, or
