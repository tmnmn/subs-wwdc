00:22:58.196 --> 00:23:00.036 A:middle
the image, and it will use a

00:23:00.036 --> 00:23:01.466 A:middle
streaming API such that you only

00:23:01.466 --> 00:23:03.136 A:middle
pay the dirty memory cost of the

00:23:03.136 --> 00:23:03.996 A:middle
resulting image.

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:05.256 A:middle
So this will save you a memory

00:23:05.256 --> 00:23:05.566 A:middle
spike.

00:23:06.076 --> 00:23:09.126 A:middle
As an example, here's some code

00:23:09.196 --> 00:23:10.346 A:middle
where I get a file on disk.

00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:11.526 A:middle
This could also be a file I

00:23:11.526 --> 00:23:11.996 A:middle
downloaded.

00:23:12.916 --> 00:23:16.456 A:middle
And I'm using the UIImage to

00:23:16.546 --> 00:23:17.696 A:middle
draw into a smaller rect.

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:19.216 A:middle
This is still going to have that

00:23:19.216 --> 00:23:19.796 A:middle
big spike.

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:22.626 A:middle
Now, instead, if I switch to

00:23:22.626 --> 00:23:24.376 A:middle
ImageIO, I still have to load

00:23:24.376 --> 00:23:25.236 A:middle
the file from disk.

00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:27.846 A:middle
I set up some parameters because

00:23:27.846 --> 00:23:29.476 A:middle
it's a lower-level API to say

00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:30.936 A:middle
how big I want this image to be,

00:23:31.186 --> 00:23:33.126 A:middle
and then I just ask it to create

00:23:33.126 --> 00:23:34.206 A:middle
it with CGImageSource

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.346 A:middle
CreateThumbnail AtIndex.

00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:37.506 A:middle
Now, that CG image I can wrap in

00:23:37.506 --> 00:23:38.956 A:middle
a UIImage, and I'm good to go.

00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:40.246 A:middle
I've got a much smaller image,

00:23:40.526 --> 00:23:42.046 A:middle
and it's about 50% faster than

00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:43.486 A:middle
that previous code.

00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:47.086 A:middle
Now, another thing we want to

00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:48.406 A:middle
talk about is how to optimize

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:49.096 A:middle
when in the background.

00:23:49.946 --> 00:23:53.316 A:middle
Say I have an image in an app,

00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:54.196 A:middle
full screen.

00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:54.886 A:middle
It's beautiful.

00:23:54.886 --> 00:23:55.446 A:middle
I'm loving it.

00:23:55.906 --> 00:23:57.376 A:middle
But then, I need to go to my

00:23:57.376 --> 00:23:58.706 A:middle
Home screen to take care of a

00:23:58.706 --> 00:24:00.376 A:middle
notification or go to a
