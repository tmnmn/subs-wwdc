00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.706 A:middle
We have some special notes on

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:02.676 A:middle
images, optimizing when in the

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:03.116 A:middle
background.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.465 A:middle
And then, we'll wrap it all up

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:05.096 A:middle
with a nice demo.

00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:08.786 A:middle
So why reduce memory?

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:12.196 A:middle
The easy answer is users have a

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.086 A:middle
better experience.

00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:14.586 A:middle
Not only will your app launch

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:14.986 A:middle
faster.

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:16.276 A:middle
The system will perform better.

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:18.016 A:middle
Your app will stay in memory

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:18.436 A:middle
longer.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.646 A:middle
Other apps will stay in memory

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:20.036 A:middle
longer.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.466 A:middle
Pretty much everything's better.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.176 A:middle
Now, if you look to your left

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
and look to your right, you're

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:25.426 A:middle
actually helping those

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:26.796 A:middle
developers out as well by

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:27.676 A:middle
reducing your memory.

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.716 A:middle
Now, we're talking about

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.646 A:middle
reducing memory, but really,

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:32.616 A:middle
it's the memory footprint.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.376 A:middle
Not all memory is created equal.

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:35.616 A:middle
What do I mean by that?

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:37.666 A:middle
Well, we need to talk about

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.186 A:middle
pages.

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:39.646 A:middle
Not that type of pages.

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:41.566 A:middle
We're talking about pages of

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:41.876 A:middle
memory.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.196 A:middle
Now, a memory page is given to

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:46.096 A:middle
you by the system, and it can

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:47.346 A:middle
hold multiple objects on the

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:47.676 A:middle
heap.

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:50.206 A:middle
And some objects can actually

00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:51.496 A:middle
span multiple pages.

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.866 A:middle
They're typically 16K in size,

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:57.816 A:middle
and they can come in clean or

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:58.176 A:middle
dirty.
