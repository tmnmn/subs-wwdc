00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:00.056 A:middle
system.

00:27:00.866 --> 00:27:04.076 A:middle
Second, the operating system

00:27:04.076 --> 00:27:06.796 A:middle
doesn't just, doesn't use just

00:27:06.926 --> 00:27:08.396 A:middle
how much memory your app is

00:27:08.396 --> 00:27:09.606 A:middle
using when designing when to

00:27:09.606 --> 00:27:11.176 A:middle
terminate your app, but also

00:27:11.176 --> 00:27:12.246 A:middle
what else is going on in the

00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:13.206 A:middle
operating system.

00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:15.446 A:middle
So just because we're not to the

00:27:15.446 --> 00:27:16.956 A:middle
red yet doesn't mean we're not

00:27:16.956 --> 00:27:19.176 A:middle
in danger of being terminated.

00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:22.196 A:middle
And third, this represents a

00:27:22.376 --> 00:27:23.606 A:middle
terrible experience for the

00:27:23.606 --> 00:27:24.076 A:middle
user.

00:27:24.636 --> 00:27:25.706 A:middle
In fact, if you look at the

00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:27.736 A:middle
usage comparison chart, you can

00:27:27.736 --> 00:27:29.776 A:middle
see other processes has zero

00:27:29.776 --> 00:27:30.856 A:middle
kilobytes of memory.

00:27:31.496 --> 00:27:32.726 A:middle
That's because they've all been

00:27:32.726 --> 00:27:33.866 A:middle
jettisoned by the operating

00:27:33.866 --> 00:27:36.906 A:middle
system to make room for our app.

00:27:36.906 --> 00:27:38.266 A:middle
You should all take a good look

00:27:38.266 --> 00:27:39.856 A:middle
at me and give me the stink eye

00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:41.686 A:middle
because now when the user has to

00:27:41.686 --> 00:27:43.156 A:middle
go watch your app, you have to

00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:44.076 A:middle
load from scratch.

00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:47.046 A:middle
So James makes some pretty good

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:48.316 A:middle
points, so I think, in general,

00:27:48.316 --> 00:27:49.566 A:middle
we want to get this needle as

00:27:49.566 --> 00:27:51.856 A:middle
far to the left as possible

00:27:51.856 --> 00:27:53.216 A:middle
instead of as far to the right.

00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:55.766 A:middle
So let's see what we can do.

00:27:56.256 --> 00:27:57.496 A:middle
Let me go ahead and take a look

00:27:57.496 --> 00:27:58.706 A:middle
at the Memgraph file.

00:27:59.266 --> 00:28:03.496 A:middle
And I have a couple go-to tricks
