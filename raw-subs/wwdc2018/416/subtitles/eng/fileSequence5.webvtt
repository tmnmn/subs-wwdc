00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:00.986 A:middle
cool.

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:01.996 A:middle
iOS doesn't have a traditional

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:03.066 A:middle
disk swap system.

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:05.976 A:middle
Instead, it uses a memory

00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:06.446 A:middle
compressor.

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:07.926 A:middle
This was introduced in iOS 7.

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:10.606 A:middle
Now, a memory compressor or the

00:05:10.606 --> 00:05:12.526 A:middle
memory compressor will take

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:13.776 A:middle
unaccessed pages and squeeze

00:05:13.776 --> 00:05:14.946 A:middle
them down, which can actually

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:15.656 A:middle
create more space.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:17.586 A:middle
But on access, the compressor

00:05:17.586 --> 00:05:19.226 A:middle
will then decompress them so the

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:20.266 A:middle
memory can be read.

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.076 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:24.526 A:middle
Say I have a dictionary that I'm

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:25.316 A:middle
using for caching.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.336 A:middle
Now, it uses up three pages of

00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:29.796 A:middle
memory right now, but if I

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.266 A:middle
haven't accessed this in a while

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:32.436 A:middle
and it needs to, the system

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:33.366 A:middle
needs some space, it can

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.836 A:middle
actually squeeze it down into

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:35.436 A:middle
one page.

00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:38.156 A:middle
Now, this is now compressed, but

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:40.806 A:middle
I'm actually saving space or

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:42.246 A:middle
I've got two extra pages.

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:44.056 A:middle
So if, some point in the future,

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.786 A:middle
I access it, it will grow back.

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:47.876 A:middle
So let's talk about memory

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:48.696 A:middle
warnings for a second.

00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:51.586 A:middle
The app is not always the cause

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:52.876 A:middle
of a memory warning.

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:54.736 A:middle
So if you're on a low-memory

00:05:54.736 --> 00:05:57.196 A:middle
device and you get a phone call,

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.156 A:middle
that could trigger a memory

00:05:58.156 --> 00:05:59.036 A:middle
warning, and you're out.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.586 A:middle
So don't necessarily assume that
