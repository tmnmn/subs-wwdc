00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:01.586 A:middle
or multiple noir filters, or

00:29:01.586 --> 00:29:03.366 A:middle
multiple filters in memory, more

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:04.676 A:middle
than I expect, that's something

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:05.716 A:middle
else I could investigate.

00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:09.736 A:middle
Well, there's no more instances

00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:10.816 A:middle
here than I expect, but maybe

00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:12.076 A:middle
one of these is really big.

00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:13.726 A:middle
It's not very likely, but I

00:29:13.726 --> 00:29:14.366 A:middle
might as well check.

00:29:14.566 --> 00:29:16.956 A:middle
So I'm going to go to the memory

00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:17.386 A:middle
inspector.

00:29:17.386 --> 00:29:18.206 A:middle
I'm going to look at these.

00:29:18.286 --> 00:29:19.576 A:middle
Each of them, it lists the size

00:29:19.576 --> 00:29:20.666 A:middle
for each of the objects.

00:29:21.016 --> 00:29:22.296 A:middle
So I can see my app delegate is

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:23.486 A:middle
32 bytes.

00:29:23.966 --> 00:29:24.896 A:middle
The data view controller is

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:25.796 A:middle
1500.

00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:27.556 A:middle
As I go through each of these,

00:29:28.506 --> 00:29:30.056 A:middle
none of these are clearly

00:29:30.056 --> 00:29:33.596 A:middle
responsible for the, you know, 1

00:29:33.596 --> 00:29:35.876 A:middle
plus gigabytes of memory my app

00:29:35.876 --> 00:29:36.436 A:middle
is using.

00:29:37.096 --> 00:29:38.766 A:middle
So that's it for my bag of

00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:40.246 A:middle
tricks in dealing with Memgraph

00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:40.936 A:middle
in Xcode.

00:29:41.466 --> 00:29:42.436 A:middle
Where do I go now?

00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:45.106 A:middle
Well, I just watched this great

00:29:45.356 --> 00:29:48.236 A:middle
WWDC session about using

00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:50.276 A:middle
command-line tools in Memgraph

00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:50.646 A:middle
files.

00:29:51.516 --> 00:29:53.276 A:middle
So let me see if I can find

00:29:53.276 --> 00:29:55.876 A:middle
anything by trying that.

00:29:55.876 --> 00:29:57.236 A:middle
And thinking back, the first

00:29:57.236 --> 00:29:59.036 A:middle
thing James suggested was using

00:29:59.036 --> 00:30:01.636 A:middle
vmmap with the summary flag.
