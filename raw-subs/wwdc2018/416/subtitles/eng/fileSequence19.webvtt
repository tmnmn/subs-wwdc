00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:01.446 A:middle
Once it's been decoded, it can

00:19:01.446 --> 00:19:02.556 A:middle
be rendered at will.

00:19:03.136 --> 00:19:05.206 A:middle
For more information on images

00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:06.936 A:middle
and how to kind of optimize

00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:08.346 A:middle
them, I'd recommend checking out

00:19:08.346 --> 00:19:10.296 A:middle
the Images and Graphics Best

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.646 A:middle
Practice session that was

00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:13.946 A:middle
earlier this week.

00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:16.076 A:middle
Now, 4 bytes per pixel we got by

00:19:16.176 --> 00:19:17.286 A:middle
the SRGB format.

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:19.186 A:middle
This is typically the most

00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:21.266 A:middle
common format that images in

00:19:21.266 --> 00:19:21.856 A:middle
graphics are.

00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:26.196 A:middle
It's 8 bits per pixel, so you

00:19:26.816 --> 00:19:28.776 A:middle
have 1 byte for red, 1 byte for

00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:30.816 A:middle
green, and 1 byte for blue, and

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:31.596 A:middle
an alpha component.

00:19:33.126 --> 00:19:36.036 A:middle
However, we can go larger.

00:19:36.036 --> 00:19:38.806 A:middle
iOS hardware can render wide

00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:39.176 A:middle
format.

00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:40.736 A:middle
Now, wide format, to get that

00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:42.476 A:middle
expressive colors, requires 2

00:19:42.476 --> 00:19:44.356 A:middle
bytes per pixel, so we double

00:19:44.356 --> 00:19:45.456 A:middle
the size of our image.

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:49.176 A:middle
Cameras on the iPhone 7, 8, X,

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.006 A:middle
and the, some of the iPad Pros

00:19:51.436 --> 00:19:53.036 A:middle
are great for capturing this

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:55.006 A:middle
high-fidelity content.

00:19:55.576 --> 00:19:56.966 A:middle
You can also use it for super

00:19:56.966 --> 00:19:57.976 A:middle
accurate colors for, like,

00:19:57.976 --> 00:19:58.946 A:middle
sports logos and such.
