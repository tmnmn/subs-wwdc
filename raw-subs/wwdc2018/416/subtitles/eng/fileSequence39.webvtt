00:38:58.556 --> 00:39:00.156 A:middle
the starting memory address of

00:39:00.156 --> 00:39:01.096 A:middle
my VM region.

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:02.856 A:middle
Let's see what this looks like.

00:39:04.036 --> 00:39:05.386 A:middle
Well, this actually is not that

00:39:05.386 --> 00:39:06.566 A:middle
big of a backtrace, and I can

00:39:06.566 --> 00:39:09.066 A:middle
see actually my code appears on,

00:39:09.066 --> 00:39:10.126 A:middle
here on several lines.

00:39:10.576 --> 00:39:12.676 A:middle
Lines 6 through 9 actually come

00:39:12.676 --> 00:39:14.106 A:middle
straight from my application

00:39:14.106 --> 00:39:16.066 A:middle
code, and I can see here on line

00:39:16.066 --> 00:39:19.046 A:middle
6 that my NoirFilter apply

00:39:19.046 --> 00:39:21.186 A:middle
function is what is responsible

00:39:21.186 --> 00:39:23.376 A:middle
for creating this particular VM

00:39:23.726 --> 00:39:24.486 A:middle
region.

00:39:24.996 --> 00:39:27.626 A:middle
So that's pretty good smoking

00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:28.826 A:middle
gun as to where I want to look

00:39:28.826 --> 00:39:30.576 A:middle
in my app for who's creating all

00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:31.216 A:middle
this memory.

00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:33.566 A:middle
And in fact, if we go back to

00:39:33.566 --> 00:39:34.806 A:middle
the Memgraph file, I can

00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:36.586 A:middle
actually see that's the same

00:39:36.586 --> 00:39:38.296 A:middle
backtrace that appears in Xcode

00:39:38.296 --> 00:39:38.626 A:middle
here.

00:39:39.186 --> 00:39:40.446 A:middle
You can actually see right here

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:42.076 A:middle
is also the NoirFilter apply

00:39:42.076 --> 00:39:42.526 A:middle
method.

00:39:42.886 --> 00:39:44.046 A:middle
We don't get the nice

00:39:44.046 --> 00:39:45.646 A:middle
highlighting you normally see in

00:39:45.646 --> 00:39:47.176 A:middle
the backtrace view here because

00:39:47.176 --> 00:39:48.286 A:middle
we're not debugging a live

00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:48.796 A:middle
process.

00:39:48.796 --> 00:39:50.116 A:middle
We're loading a Memgraph file.

00:39:50.526 --> 00:39:51.686 A:middle
But you can see it's the exact

00:39:51.686 --> 00:39:52.796 A:middle
same output as we get from

00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:53.566 A:middle
malloc history.

00:39:53.926 --> 00:39:57.786 A:middle
And in fact, to just kind of a

00:39:57.986 --> 00:39:59.616 A:middle
confirm things even further, if

00:39:59.616 --> 00:40:02.036 A:middle
I go ahead and I look at my full
