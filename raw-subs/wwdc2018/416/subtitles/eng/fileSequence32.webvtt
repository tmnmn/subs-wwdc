00:31:57.216 --> 00:32:00.376 A:middle
pass my Memgraph file.

00:32:01.266 --> 00:32:02.806 A:middle
But I really only care about the

00:32:02.896 --> 00:32:04.126 A:middle
CG image memory.

00:32:04.336 --> 00:32:05.936 A:middle
I don't care about all the other

00:32:05.936 --> 00:32:09.186 A:middle
virtual memory regions that

00:32:09.186 --> 00:32:10.516 A:middle
vmmap will tell me about.

00:32:10.516 --> 00:32:12.026 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and use

00:32:12.026 --> 00:32:15.876 A:middle
grep to just show me the lines

00:32:15.906 --> 00:32:17.736 A:middle
that talk about CG image.

00:32:18.016 --> 00:32:18.896 A:middle
So let's see what that looks

00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:19.116 A:middle
like.

00:32:20.016 --> 00:32:21.336 A:middle
So now, I have three lines.

00:32:21.646 --> 00:32:24.636 A:middle
I see there's two virtual memory

00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:25.096 A:middle
regions.

00:32:25.426 --> 00:32:26.646 A:middle
There, and I see their start

00:32:26.646 --> 00:32:28.576 A:middle
address and their end address.

00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:30.416 A:middle
And then, I can see these are

00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:31.636 A:middle
the same columns as above.

00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:34.006 A:middle
This is virtual, resident,

00:32:34.516 --> 00:32:36.066 A:middle
dirty, and compressed.

00:32:36.686 --> 00:32:37.736 A:middle
And this last line here is

00:32:37.736 --> 00:32:39.586 A:middle
actually the summary line again.

00:32:40.536 --> 00:32:43.216 A:middle
So that's the same data that was

00:32:43.216 --> 00:32:43.666 A:middle
above.

00:32:44.506 --> 00:32:45.966 A:middle
Looking at my two regions, I can

00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:47.616 A:middle
see I have a really small region

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:49.026 A:middle
and a really big region.

00:32:49.416 --> 00:32:50.986 A:middle
That big region is clearly what

00:32:50.986 --> 00:32:53.706 A:middle
I want to know more about.

00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:55.876 A:middle
So how can I find out more about

00:32:55.876 --> 00:32:58.286 A:middle
that particular VM region?

00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:00.366 A:middle
Well, I went looking through the
