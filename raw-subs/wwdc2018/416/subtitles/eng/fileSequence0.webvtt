&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:29.686 A:middle
My name's Kyle.

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:30.776 A:middle
I'm a software engineer at Apple

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:32.195 A:middle
and today we'd like to take a

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:33.386 A:middle
deep dive into iOS memory.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.986 A:middle
Now, just as a quick note, even

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:36.986 A:middle
though this is focused on iOS, a

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:38.536 A:middle
lot of what we're covering will

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:41.386 A:middle
apply to other platforms as

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:42.546 A:middle
well.

00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:44.626 A:middle
So the first thing we'd want to

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:46.386 A:middle
talk about is, why reduce

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:46.706 A:middle
memory?

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:50.836 A:middle
And when we want to reduce

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:51.746 A:middle
memory, really, we're talking

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:52.676 A:middle
about reducing our memory

00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:53.116 A:middle
footprint.

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:53.976 A:middle
So we'll talk about that.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.586 A:middle
We have some tools for how to

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:57.986 A:middle
profile a memory footprint.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.706 A:middle
We have some special notes on
