00:29:59.036 --> 00:30:01.636 A:middle
vmmap with the summary flag.

00:30:02.846 --> 00:30:04.196 A:middle
So let me give that a try, and

00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:06.816 A:middle
let me pass in my Memgraph file.

00:30:06.886 --> 00:30:10.286 A:middle
And let's take a look at this

00:30:10.286 --> 00:30:10.696 A:middle
output.

00:30:11.756 --> 00:30:13.016 A:middle
So now, what should I be looking

00:30:13.016 --> 00:30:13.706 A:middle
for in here?

00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:15.716 A:middle
Now, in general, I'm looking for

00:30:15.716 --> 00:30:16.776 A:middle
really big numbers.

00:30:16.776 --> 00:30:17.846 A:middle
I'm trying to figure out what's

00:30:17.846 --> 00:30:19.196 A:middle
using all this memory, and the

00:30:19.196 --> 00:30:20.656 A:middle
bigger numbers mean more memory

00:30:20.656 --> 00:30:20.946 A:middle
use.

00:30:21.566 --> 00:30:23.566 A:middle
Now, there's a number of columns

00:30:23.566 --> 00:30:25.876 A:middle
here, and, you know, some of

00:30:25.876 --> 00:30:26.776 A:middle
them are more important than

00:30:26.776 --> 00:30:27.196 A:middle
others.

00:30:27.806 --> 00:30:30.166 A:middle
First of all, virtual size, I

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:32.226 A:middle
mean, virtual means not real.

00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:34.126 A:middle
I can almost practically ignore

00:30:34.126 --> 00:30:34.846 A:middle
this column.

00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:36.246 A:middle
It's memory that the app has

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:37.566 A:middle
requested but isn't necessarily

00:30:37.566 --> 00:30:38.056 A:middle
using.

00:30:38.736 --> 00:30:40.356 A:middle
Dirty sounds like something I

00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:42.036 A:middle
definitely don't want in my app.

00:30:42.546 --> 00:30:44.466 A:middle
I'd much rather my app be clean

00:30:44.466 --> 00:30:45.896 A:middle
than dirty, so that's probably

00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:46.916 A:middle
something I want smaller.

00:30:47.356 --> 00:30:48.416 A:middle
And then, swapped, which,

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:49.456 A:middle
because this is iOS, is

00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:52.316 A:middle
compressed, remembering back to

00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:55.156 A:middle
both Kyle and James pointed out

00:30:55.236 --> 00:30:57.386 A:middle
that it's the dirty size plus

00:30:57.386 --> 00:30:59.606 A:middle
the compressed size that the

00:30:59.606 --> 00:31:00.816 A:middle
operating system uses to
