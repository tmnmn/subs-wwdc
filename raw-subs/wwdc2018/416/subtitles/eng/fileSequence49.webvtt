starry-eyed emoji.

00:49:04.526 --> 00:49:06.166 A:middle
And hopefully James will be

00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:07.326 A:middle
happy with these results.

00:49:07.326 --> 00:49:10.316 A:middle
So now, I'm going to hand it

00:49:10.316 --> 00:49:11.876 A:middle
back to Kyle, who's going to

00:49:11.876 --> 00:49:12.816 A:middle
wrap things up for us.

00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:13.696 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:49:16.756 --> 00:49:17.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Kris.

00:49:20.096 --> 00:49:20.526 A:middle
Thanks, Kris.

00:49:21.566 --> 00:49:22.366 A:middle
That was awesome.

00:49:22.666 --> 00:49:24.096 A:middle
With just a little bit of work,

00:49:24.326 --> 00:49:25.856 A:middle
we were able to greatly reduce

00:49:25.856 --> 00:49:28.506 A:middle
our memory use by orders of

00:49:29.816 --> 00:49:30.076 A:middle
magnitude.

00:49:30.786 --> 00:49:34.896 A:middle
So in summary, memory is finite

00:49:34.896 --> 00:49:35.356 A:middle
and shared.

00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:37.786 A:middle
The more we use, the less the

00:49:37.786 --> 00:49:39.156 A:middle
system has for others to use it.

00:49:39.236 --> 00:49:40.076 A:middle
We really need to be good

00:49:40.076 --> 00:49:41.786 A:middle
citizens, and be mindful of our

00:49:41.786 --> 00:49:43.086 A:middle
memory use, and only use what we

00:49:43.086 --> 00:49:43.366 A:middle
need.

00:49:46.336 --> 00:49:47.706 A:middle
When we're debugging, that

00:49:47.706 --> 00:49:49.766 A:middle
memory report in Xcode is

00:49:49.846 --> 00:49:50.276 A:middle
crucial.

00:49:50.636 --> 00:49:51.726 A:middle
We can just turn it on when our

00:49:51.726 --> 00:49:52.756 A:middle
app is running because then, as

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:54.516 A:middle
we monitor it, the more we can

00:49:54.516 --> 00:49:56.756 A:middle
notice the regressions as we're

00:49:56.756 --> 00:49:57.206 A:middle
debugging.

00:49:59.076 --> 00:50:01.076 A:middle
We want to make sure that iOS
