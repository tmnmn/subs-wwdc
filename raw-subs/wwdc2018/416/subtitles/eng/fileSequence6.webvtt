00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.586 A:middle
So don't necessarily assume that

00:06:00.996 --> 00:06:02.826 A:middle
a memory warning is your cause.

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:06.386 A:middle
So this compressor complicates

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:08.636 A:middle
freeing memory because,

00:06:09.516 --> 00:06:10.146 A:middle
depending on what it's

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:11.236 A:middle
compressed, you can actually use

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:12.106 A:middle
more memory than before.

00:06:12.356 --> 00:06:14.336 A:middle
So instead, we recommend policy

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:15.986 A:middle
changes, such as maybe not

00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:17.136 A:middle
caching anything for a little

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:18.896 A:middle
bit or kind of throttling some

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.146 A:middle
of the background work when a

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.106 A:middle
memory warning occurs.

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:24.386 A:middle
Now, some of us may have this in

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:24.846 A:middle
our apps.

00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:27.726 A:middle
We get a memory warning, and we

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:28.826 A:middle
decide to remove all objects

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:31.126 A:middle
from our cache.

00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:32.766 A:middle
Going back to that example of

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:33.856 A:middle
the compressed dictionary,

00:06:34.646 --> 00:06:35.606 A:middle
what's going to happen?

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.446 A:middle
Well, since I'm now accessing

00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:39.496 A:middle
that dictionary, I'm now using

00:06:39.496 --> 00:06:41.216 A:middle
up more pages than I was before.

00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:43.866 A:middle
This is not what we want to do

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:44.896 A:middle
in a memory-constrained

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:45.546 A:middle
environment.

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:47.726 A:middle
And because I'm removing all the

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:50.186 A:middle
objects, I'm doing a lot of work

00:06:50.186 --> 00:06:51.306 A:middle
just to get it back down to one

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:52.356 A:middle
page, which is what it was when

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:53.016 A:middle
it was compressed.

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:55.346 A:middle
So we really got to be careful

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:57.486 A:middle
about memory warnings in

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:57.796 A:middle
general.

00:06:59.376 --> 00:07:01.326 A:middle
Now, this brings up an important
