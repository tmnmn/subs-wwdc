00:06:59.376 --> 00:07:01.326 A:middle
Now, this brings up an important

00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:02.466 A:middle
point about caching.

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:04.826 A:middle
When we cache, we are really

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:05.926 A:middle
trying to save the CPU from

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:07.466 A:middle
doing repeated work, but if we

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:08.826 A:middle
cache too much, we're going to

00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:10.306 A:middle
use up all of our memory, and

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:12.076 A:middle
that can have problems with the

00:07:12.076 --> 00:07:12.476 A:middle
system.

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:15.316 A:middle
So try and remember that there's

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:16.536 A:middle
a memory compressor and cache,

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:17.966 A:middle
you know, get that balance just

00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:19.076 A:middle
right on what to cache and what

00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:20.326 A:middle
to kind of recompute.

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:22.676 A:middle
One other note is that if you

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:23.796 A:middle
use an NSCache instead of a

00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:25.706 A:middle
dictionary, that's a threat-safe

00:07:25.706 --> 00:07:28.146 A:middle
way to store cached objects.

00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:30.336 A:middle
And because of the way NSCache

00:07:30.336 --> 00:07:31.326 A:middle
allocates its memory, it's

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.806 A:middle
actually purgeable, so it works

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:33.396 A:middle
even better in a

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:34.436 A:middle
memory-constrained environment.

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:38.396 A:middle
Going back to our typical app

00:07:38.396 --> 00:07:40.136 A:middle
with those three sections, when

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:41.166 A:middle
we talk about the app's

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:42.636 A:middle
footprint, we're really talking

00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:44.046 A:middle
about the dirty and compressed

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:44.656 A:middle
segments.

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:46.556 A:middle
Clean memory doesn't really

00:07:46.556 --> 00:07:46.766 A:middle
count.

00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:51.396 A:middle
Now, every app has a footprint

00:07:51.396 --> 00:07:51.646 A:middle
limit.

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:54.816 A:middle
Now, this limit's fairly high

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.486 A:middle
for an app, but keep in mind

00:07:56.556 --> 00:07:57.786 A:middle
that, depending on the device,

00:07:58.276 --> 00:07:59.386 A:middle
your limit will change.

00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:01.346 A:middle
So you won't be able to use as
