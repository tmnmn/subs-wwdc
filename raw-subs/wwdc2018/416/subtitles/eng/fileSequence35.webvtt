00:34:59.516 --> 00:35:00.466 A:middle
I already know from looking at

00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:01.796 A:middle
the Memgraph there's no leaks,

00:35:02.096 --> 00:35:03.346 A:middle
so that doesn't seem like the

00:35:03.346 --> 00:35:04.276 A:middle
tool I want to use.

00:35:04.696 --> 00:35:06.636 A:middle
But I went looking through the

00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:09.896 A:middle
help information for leaks, and

00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:11.466 A:middle
it turns out leaks can do lots

00:35:11.466 --> 00:35:14.016 A:middle
of things and including telling

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:16.296 A:middle
me who has references to either

00:35:16.296 --> 00:35:17.986 A:middle
an object on the heap or virtual

00:35:17.986 --> 00:35:18.736 A:middle
memory region.

00:35:19.226 --> 00:35:20.236 A:middle
So let's go ahead and see what

00:35:20.236 --> 00:35:21.016 A:middle
that tells us.

00:35:21.696 --> 00:35:23.556 A:middle
So I'm going to use leaks, and

00:35:23.556 --> 00:35:25.746 A:middle
then I'm going to pass this

00:35:25.806 --> 00:35:27.326 A:middle
traceTree flag.

00:35:27.986 --> 00:35:29.146 A:middle
And what that does is it gives

00:35:29.146 --> 00:35:32.056 A:middle
me a tree view of everything

00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:33.556 A:middle
that has a reference to the

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:34.826 A:middle
address I'm passing in.

00:35:34.826 --> 00:35:36.916 A:middle
In this case, I'm passing in the

00:35:36.916 --> 00:35:39.786 A:middle
starting address of my virtual

00:35:39.786 --> 00:35:41.886 A:middle
memory region.

00:35:42.446 --> 00:35:44.006 A:middle
And then, finally, we give it

00:35:44.006 --> 00:35:44.956 A:middle
the Memgraph file.

00:35:45.906 --> 00:35:47.276 A:middle
So what does this look like?

00:35:47.466 --> 00:35:49.526 A:middle
So what we see here is this tree

00:35:49.636 --> 00:35:50.936 A:middle
of all these references.

00:35:50.936 --> 00:35:52.136 A:middle
If we scroll up to the top,

00:35:53.196 --> 00:35:55.076 A:middle
which is way up here, I can

00:35:55.076 --> 00:35:56.746 A:middle
actually see here's my VM

00:35:56.746 --> 00:35:58.716 A:middle
region, here's my CG image

00:35:58.716 --> 00:35:59.856 A:middle
region, and then I can see

00:35:59.856 --> 00:36:02.346 A:middle
there's a tree view here of all
