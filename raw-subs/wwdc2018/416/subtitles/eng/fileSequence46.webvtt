00:45:59.486 --> 00:46:02.356 A:middle
And then, once it's there -- oh,

00:46:02.356 --> 00:46:05.636 A:middle
there's a warning.

00:46:06.216 --> 00:46:09.566 A:middle
I have an extra this.

00:46:10.996 --> 00:46:11.676 A:middle
Let's see.

00:46:12.786 --> 00:46:14.226 A:middle
Okay, building.

00:46:15.256 --> 00:46:16.466 A:middle
Building, building, building.

00:46:17.236 --> 00:46:18.036 A:middle
Okay, launching.

00:46:18.356 --> 00:46:19.576 A:middle
Good. All right.

00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:20.406 A:middle
Now, let's go ahead and take a

00:46:20.406 --> 00:46:21.526 A:middle
look at the memory report.

00:46:22.886 --> 00:46:25.646 A:middle
Let's go back to Saturn's north

00:46:25.686 --> 00:46:27.036 A:middle
pole, which is something I've

00:46:27.036 --> 00:46:28.556 A:middle
always wanted to say.

00:46:29.926 --> 00:46:32.036 A:middle
And let's apply our image and

00:46:32.036 --> 00:46:33.496 A:middle
see what it goes to now.

00:46:33.496 --> 00:46:35.936 A:middle
So now, we're at 75, 93

00:46:35.936 --> 00:46:36.456 A:middle
megabytes.

00:46:36.966 --> 00:46:38.786 A:middle
Our high-water mark in this case

00:46:38.786 --> 00:46:41.046 A:middle
is 93 megabytes.

00:46:41.626 --> 00:46:42.866 A:middle
Significant improvement.

00:46:44.946 --> 00:46:46.816 A:middle
[applause] Much better than the

00:46:46.816 --> 00:46:48.126 A:middle
almost guaranteed to get shut

00:46:48.176 --> 00:46:50.886 A:middle
down 7-and-a-half gigabytes.

00:46:51.516 --> 00:46:53.076 A:middle
But now, I remember there's

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:55.126 A:middle
actually, I want to go back, and

00:46:55.126 --> 00:46:58.186 A:middle
let's go ahead and stop.

00:46:58.186 --> 00:46:59.806 A:middle
And I still want to go back to

00:46:59.806 --> 00:47:03.556 A:middle
my filter method and change this
