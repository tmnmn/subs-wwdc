00:25:59.546 --> 00:26:00.386 A:middle
our Sun.

00:26:00.996 --> 00:26:02.496 A:middle
I'm really pleased with how it's

00:26:02.496 --> 00:26:04.396 A:middle
going so far, so I sent it off

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.926 A:middle
to James to get his opinion on

00:26:05.926 --> 00:26:07.956 A:middle
it, and he sent me back an email

00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:09.146 A:middle
with 2 attachments.

00:26:09.826 --> 00:26:12.196 A:middle
One was a Memgraph file, and the

00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:13.626 A:middle
other one was this image.

00:26:15.776 --> 00:26:17.846 A:middle
Now, James is a pretty reserved

00:26:17.846 --> 00:26:19.916 A:middle
and understated guy, so when

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:21.676 A:middle
he's got 2 red exclamation

00:26:21.676 --> 00:26:23.746 A:middle
points and a scream emoji, I

00:26:23.746 --> 00:26:24.706 A:middle
know he's pretty upset.

00:26:25.546 --> 00:26:27.156 A:middle
So I went to James and I said,

00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:28.496 A:middle
"You know, I don't understand

00:26:28.496 --> 00:26:29.386 A:middle
what the big deal is.

00:26:29.736 --> 00:26:31.626 A:middle
I clearly have at least half a

00:26:31.626 --> 00:26:33.026 A:middle
gigabyte before I'm even in the

00:26:33.086 --> 00:26:34.266 A:middle
red, you know.

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:35.416 A:middle
I have all this available

00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:35.776 A:middle
memory.

00:26:35.866 --> 00:26:36.796 A:middle
Shouldn't I be using it?"

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:39.646 A:middle
And James, who's a much better

00:26:39.646 --> 00:26:41.016 A:middle
developer than I am, pointed out

00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:42.736 A:middle
a few things that's, a few

00:26:42.736 --> 00:26:43.516 A:middle
things that are wrong with my

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:43.926 A:middle
logic.

00:26:44.156 --> 00:26:46.976 A:middle
First of all, this gauge is

00:26:47.026 --> 00:26:49.026 A:middle
measuring a device with 2

00:26:49.026 --> 00:26:49.926 A:middle
gigabytes of memory.

00:26:50.566 --> 00:26:51.866 A:middle
Not all our devices have that

00:26:51.866 --> 00:26:52.406 A:middle
much memory.

00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:54.106 A:middle
If this code was running on a

00:26:54.106 --> 00:26:55.696 A:middle
device with a, only 1 gigabyte

00:26:55.696 --> 00:26:57.306 A:middle
of memory, there's a good chance

00:26:57.306 --> 00:26:58.316 A:middle
our app would already be

00:26:58.316 --> 00:26:59.606 A:middle
terminated by the operating

00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:00.056 A:middle
system.
