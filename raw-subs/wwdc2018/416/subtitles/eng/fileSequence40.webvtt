00:39:59.616 --> 00:40:02.036 A:middle
I go ahead and I look at my full

00:40:02.136 --> 00:40:05.956 A:middle
list of CG image VM regions and

00:40:05.956 --> 00:40:09.066 A:middle
I collect, I grab the second one

00:40:09.066 --> 00:40:10.156 A:middle
from the bottom, the next one

00:40:10.156 --> 00:40:11.916 A:middle
up, and let's look at the

00:40:11.916 --> 00:40:13.176 A:middle
backtrace for that one.

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.686 A:middle
And it turns out it's the same

00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:17.326 A:middle
backtrace.

00:40:17.526 --> 00:40:18.896 A:middle
So the same code path is

00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:20.056 A:middle
responsible for that region as

00:40:20.056 --> 00:40:20.496 A:middle
well.

00:40:20.966 --> 00:40:23.486 A:middle
And in fact, looking at several

00:40:23.486 --> 00:40:24.976 A:middle
of those regions, it actually

00:40:24.976 --> 00:40:26.276 A:middle
uses the same backtrace.

00:40:26.766 --> 00:40:27.886 A:middle
So now, I have a really good

00:40:27.886 --> 00:40:30.086 A:middle
idea of what in my application

00:40:30.086 --> 00:40:32.326 A:middle
is responsible for creating

00:40:32.326 --> 00:40:33.636 A:middle
these VM regions that are using

00:40:33.636 --> 00:40:34.896 A:middle
up a whole bunch of the memory

00:40:34.896 --> 00:40:35.776 A:middle
in my application.

00:40:36.706 --> 00:40:37.836 A:middle
So what can we do about it?

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.186 A:middle
Well, let's go back to Xcode,

00:40:40.186 --> 00:40:41.266 A:middle
and I can go ahead and close the

00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:42.276 A:middle
Memgraph file.

00:40:43.396 --> 00:40:46.196 A:middle
And the first thing I want to do

00:40:46.196 --> 00:40:47.386 A:middle
is let's take a look at the code

00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:47.626 A:middle
here.

00:40:48.406 --> 00:40:52.536 A:middle
If I look at my filter, I can

00:40:52.536 --> 00:40:54.436 A:middle
see right here is the apply

00:40:54.436 --> 00:40:55.926 A:middle
function, and I can actually see

00:40:55.926 --> 00:40:57.026 A:middle
right away something jumps out

00:40:57.026 --> 00:40:58.776 A:middle
at me, which is I'm using the

00:40:58.776 --> 00:41:00.746 A:middle
UIGraphicsBegin ImageContext
