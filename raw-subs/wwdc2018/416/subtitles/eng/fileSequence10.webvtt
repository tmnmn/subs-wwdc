00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.046 A:middle
VM Memory Trace.

00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:03.326 A:middle
This provides a deep view into

00:10:03.326 --> 00:10:04.446 A:middle
the virtual memory system's

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:05.806 A:middle
performance with regards to your

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:06.726 A:middle
app.

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:10.486 A:middle
I find the By Operation tab

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:11.226 A:middle
really useful here.

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:12.996 A:middle
It gives you a virtual memory

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:14.386 A:middle
system profile and will show you

00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:16.376 A:middle
things like page cache hits and

00:10:16.376 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
page zero fills for the VM.

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:22.536 A:middle
Kyle mentioned earlier that if

00:10:22.536 --> 00:10:23.726 A:middle
you approach the memory limit of

00:10:23.726 --> 00:10:25.146 A:middle
the device, you'll receive an

00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:26.766 A:middle
EXC resource exception.

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:28.346 A:middle
Well, if you're running your app

00:10:28.346 --> 00:10:31.136 A:middle
now in Xcode 10, Xcode will

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:32.586 A:middle
catch this exception and pause

00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:33.266 A:middle
your app for you.

00:10:33.636 --> 00:10:34.506 A:middle
This means you can start the

00:10:34.506 --> 00:10:35.636 A:middle
memory debugger and begin your

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:36.816 A:middle
investigation right from there.

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:38.066 A:middle
I think this is really, really

00:10:38.066 --> 00:10:38.436 A:middle
useful.

00:10:39.016 --> 00:10:42.006 A:middle
The memory debugger for Xcode

00:10:42.006 --> 00:10:43.606 A:middle
was shipped in Xcode 8, and it

00:10:43.606 --> 00:10:44.926 A:middle
helps you track down object

00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:46.546 A:middle
dependencies, cycles, and leaks.

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:48.336 A:middle
And in Xcode 10, it's been

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:49.716 A:middle
updated with this great new

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:50.036 A:middle
layout.

00:10:50.536 --> 00:10:52.066 A:middle
It's so good for viewing really

00:10:52.066 --> 00:10:52.986 A:middle
large Memgraphs.

00:10:53.926 --> 00:10:55.836 A:middle
Under the hood, Xcode uses the

00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:57.456 A:middle
Memgraph file format to store

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:58.916 A:middle
information about the memory use

00:10:58.916 --> 00:10:59.706 A:middle
of your app.
