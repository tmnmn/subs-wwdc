00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:00.206 A:middle
This means that vmmap will print

00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:01.496 A:middle
out the number of pages instead

00:13:01.496 --> 00:13:02.376 A:middle
of just raw bytes.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:06.796 A:middle
I then piped that into grep,

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.206 A:middle
where I'm searching for a dylib,

00:13:08.206 --> 00:13:09.456 A:middle
so I need dynamic library here.

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:12.166 A:middle
And then, finally, I pipe that

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.536 A:middle
into a super simple awk script

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:15.816 A:middle
to sum up the dirty column and

00:13:15.816 --> 00:13:16.826 A:middle
then print it out as the number

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:17.886 A:middle
of dirty pages at the end.

00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:20.556 A:middle
I think this is super cool, and

00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:22.286 A:middle
I use it all the time.

00:13:22.286 --> 00:13:23.676 A:middle
It allows you to compose really

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:25.096 A:middle
powerful debugging workflows for

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.216 A:middle
you and your teams.

00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:30.466 A:middle
Another command-line utility

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:31.686 A:middle
that macOS developers might be

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.066 A:middle
familiar with already is leaks.

00:13:33.836 --> 00:13:35.306 A:middle
It tracks objects in the heap

00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:36.906 A:middle
that aren't rooted anywhere at

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:37.396 A:middle
runtime.

00:13:37.726 --> 00:13:38.586 A:middle
So remember, if you see an

00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:39.816 A:middle
object in leaks, it's dirty

00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:41.466 A:middle
memory that you can never free.

00:13:41.846 --> 00:13:44.266 A:middle
Let's look at a leak in the

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:44.866 A:middle
memory debugger.

00:13:46.176 --> 00:13:48.176 A:middle
Here I've got 3 objects, all

00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:49.356 A:middle
holding strong references to

00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:50.546 A:middle
each other, creating a classic

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:51.166 A:middle
retain cycle.

00:13:51.876 --> 00:13:53.766 A:middle
So let's look at the same leak

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:56.446 A:middle
in the leaks tool.

00:13:56.646 --> 00:13:57.686 A:middle
This year, leaks has been

00:13:57.686 --> 00:13:59.676 A:middle
updated to not only show the

00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:02.936 A:middle
leaked objects, but also the
