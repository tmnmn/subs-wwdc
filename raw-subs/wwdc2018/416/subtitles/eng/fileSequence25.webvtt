00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
saving memory when in the

00:25:00.746 --> 00:25:02.406 A:middle
background, and I'm keeping the

00:25:02.406 --> 00:25:03.746 A:middle
same fidelity when the user

00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:04.206 A:middle
comes back.

00:25:04.396 --> 00:25:05.436 A:middle
It's completely transparent to

00:25:05.436 --> 00:25:07.226 A:middle
them, but more memory is

00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:10.476 A:middle
available to the system.

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:12.306 A:middle
Similarly, if I'm in a nav

00:25:12.306 --> 00:25:14.056 A:middle
controller or a tab controller,

00:25:14.536 --> 00:25:15.776 A:middle
my view controllers can unload

00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:16.626 A:middle
their images when they

00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:17.146 A:middle
disappear.

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:18.976 A:middle
And before they come back with

00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.336 A:middle
the viewWillAppear method, I can

00:25:21.336 --> 00:25:21.916 A:middle
reload them.

00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:23.076 A:middle
So again, the user doesn't

00:25:23.076 --> 00:25:24.066 A:middle
notice anything's different.

00:25:24.216 --> 00:25:25.506 A:middle
Our apps are just using less

00:25:25.506 --> 00:25:26.696 A:middle
memory, which is great.

00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:31.176 A:middle
And now, I'd like to invite up

00:25:31.216 --> 00:25:32.746 A:middle
Kris to kind of bring this all

00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:33.566 A:middle
together in a nice demo.

00:25:34.376 --> 00:25:34.646 A:middle
Kris?

00:25:35.516 --> 00:25:39.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:40.086 --> 00:25:41.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to switch to

00:25:41.436 --> 00:25:42.376 A:middle
the demo machine.

00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:43.756 A:middle
There we go.

00:25:44.116 --> 00:25:45.206 A:middle
So I've been working on this

00:25:45.206 --> 00:25:45.526 A:middle
app.

00:25:45.606 --> 00:25:47.596 A:middle
What it does is it starts with

00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:50.386 A:middle
these really high-resolution

00:25:50.796 --> 00:25:52.426 A:middle
images from our solar system

00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:54.056 A:middle
that I got from NASA, and it

00:25:54.056 --> 00:25:55.526 A:middle
lets you apply different filters

00:25:55.526 --> 00:25:55.866 A:middle
to them.

00:25:56.406 --> 00:25:57.416 A:middle
And here we can see a quick

00:25:57.416 --> 00:25:59.546 A:middle
example, applying a filter to

00:25:59.546 --> 00:26:00.386 A:middle
our Sun.
