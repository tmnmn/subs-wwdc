00:49:59.076 --> 00:50:01.076 A:middle
We want to make sure that iOS

00:50:01.956 --> 00:50:03.496 A:middle
picks our image formats for us.

00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:06.156 A:middle
We can save 75% memory from SRGB

00:50:06.156 --> 00:50:08.766 A:middle
to alpha 8 just by picking the

00:50:08.766 --> 00:50:10.576 A:middle
or by using the new UIImage

00:50:10.846 --> 00:50:11.996 A:middle
GraphicsRenderer APIs.

00:50:11.996 --> 00:50:14.316 A:middle
It's really great for masks and

00:50:14.316 --> 00:50:14.596 A:middle
text.

00:50:16.376 --> 00:50:18.166 A:middle
Also, we want to use ImageIO

00:50:18.936 --> 00:50:20.446 A:middle
when we downsample our images.

00:50:21.176 --> 00:50:22.836 A:middle
It provides us or prevents a

00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:24.646 A:middle
memory spike, and it's faster

00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:25.836 A:middle
than trying to draw a UIImage

00:50:25.836 --> 00:50:26.776 A:middle
into a smaller context.

00:50:27.176 --> 00:50:30.856 A:middle
Finally, we want to unload large

00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:32.706 A:middle
images and resources that are

00:50:32.706 --> 00:50:33.516 A:middle
not on the screen.

00:50:33.886 --> 00:50:34.886 A:middle
There's no sense in using that

00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:36.516 A:middle
memory because the user can't

00:50:36.516 --> 00:50:36.836 A:middle
see them.

00:50:38.166 --> 00:50:39.936 A:middle
And even after all of that,

00:50:40.156 --> 00:50:40.896 A:middle
we're still not done.

00:50:42.006 --> 00:50:44.216 A:middle
As we just saw, using Memgraphs

00:50:44.326 --> 00:50:45.926 A:middle
can help us further understand

00:50:46.346 --> 00:50:47.606 A:middle
what's going on and reduce our

00:50:47.606 --> 00:50:48.306 A:middle
memory footprint.

00:50:48.686 --> 00:50:49.576 A:middle
That combined with malloc

00:50:49.576 --> 00:50:50.906 A:middle
history gives us great insight

00:50:50.906 --> 00:50:52.006 A:middle
into where our memory's going

00:50:52.006 --> 00:50:52.966 A:middle
and what it's being used by.

00:50:54.026 --> 00:50:56.046 A:middle
So what I'd recommend is

00:50:56.046 --> 00:50:58.456 A:middle
everyone go out, turn on malloc

00:50:58.456 --> 00:51:00.426 A:middle
history, profile your tool, and
