00:43:56.126 --> 00:44:00.786 A:middle
times 13,000, and the iPhone X

00:44:00.786 --> 00:44:02.766 A:middle
is a 3X device, so it's 3 times

00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:06.436 A:middle
the width times 3 times the

00:44:06.436 --> 00:44:09.696 A:middle
height times 4 bytes per pixel.

00:44:10.506 --> 00:44:13.036 A:middle
That number looks kind of

00:44:13.036 --> 00:44:13.706 A:middle
familiar.

00:44:15.876 --> 00:44:17.786 A:middle
So I'm pretty sure I know

00:44:17.786 --> 00:44:19.306 A:middle
exactly what's using up my

00:44:19.306 --> 00:44:20.886 A:middle
7-and-a-half gigabytes of

00:44:20.886 --> 00:44:24.386 A:middle
memory, and it's not necessarily

00:44:24.386 --> 00:44:25.966 A:middle
my beginImageContext thing.

00:44:25.966 --> 00:44:27.376 A:middle
It's the size of this image.

00:44:27.746 --> 00:44:29.186 A:middle
And there's no reason the image

00:44:29.186 --> 00:44:30.506 A:middle
needs to be this big.

00:44:30.966 --> 00:44:32.146 A:middle
What I want to do is scale it

00:44:32.146 --> 00:44:33.826 A:middle
down so it's the same dimensions

00:44:33.826 --> 00:44:34.666 A:middle
as my view.

00:44:34.666 --> 00:44:36.086 A:middle
And that way, it'll take up far

00:44:36.086 --> 00:44:36.826 A:middle
less memory.

00:44:37.526 --> 00:44:38.766 A:middle
So if I go back to the image

00:44:38.766 --> 00:44:40.026 A:middle
loading code that's up here --

00:44:40.136 --> 00:44:41.216 A:middle
actually, before I do that, I

00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:42.276 A:middle
want to go ahead and disable

00:44:42.276 --> 00:44:45.146 A:middle
this break point -- so let's

00:44:45.146 --> 00:44:46.286 A:middle
take a look at what this does.

00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:46.886 A:middle
Well, it's pretty

00:44:46.886 --> 00:44:47.666 A:middle
straightforward.

00:44:47.666 --> 00:44:49.016 A:middle
It's getting the URL from a

00:44:49.016 --> 00:44:51.176 A:middle
bundle, it's loading some data

00:44:51.176 --> 00:44:52.796 A:middle
from that URL and loading it

00:44:52.796 --> 00:44:55.166 A:middle
into UIImage, then that, then,

00:44:55.346 --> 00:44:56.856 A:middle
which gets passed to the filter.

00:44:57.406 --> 00:44:58.906 A:middle
So what I want to do is, before

00:44:58.906 --> 00:45:00.276 A:middle
I send it to the filter, I want
