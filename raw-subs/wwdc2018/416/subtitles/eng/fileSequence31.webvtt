00:30:59.606 --> 00:31:00.816 A:middle
operating system uses to

00:31:00.816 --> 00:31:02.586 A:middle
determine how much memory my app

00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:03.726 A:middle
is really using.

00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:05.516 A:middle
So those are the two columns I

00:31:05.516 --> 00:31:06.796 A:middle
really want to concentrate on,

00:31:06.796 --> 00:31:07.856 A:middle
so let's look for some big

00:31:07.856 --> 00:31:08.596 A:middle
numbers there.

00:31:08.596 --> 00:31:11.126 A:middle
I can see immediately CG image

00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:11.636 A:middle
jumps out.

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:13.996 A:middle
It has a very big dirty size and

00:31:13.996 --> 00:31:15.206 A:middle
a very big swapped size.

00:31:15.256 --> 00:31:16.906 A:middle
That's a giant red flag, but

00:31:16.956 --> 00:31:17.846 A:middle
let's keep looking.

00:31:18.496 --> 00:31:21.616 A:middle
I can see this is IOSurface has

00:31:21.616 --> 00:31:23.676 A:middle
a pretty big dirty size but no

00:31:23.676 --> 00:31:24.686 A:middle
swapped size.

00:31:25.156 --> 00:31:27.776 A:middle
MALLOC LARGE has a big dirty

00:31:27.776 --> 00:31:29.876 A:middle
size but a really small or

00:31:30.146 --> 00:31:31.256 A:middle
smaller swapped size.

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:33.396 A:middle
And there's nothing else in here

00:31:33.396 --> 00:31:35.056 A:middle
that's really that big.

00:31:35.576 --> 00:31:37.696 A:middle
So I think, based on what I see

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:39.036 A:middle
here, I really want to

00:31:39.036 --> 00:31:41.476 A:middle
concentrate on the CG image VM

00:31:41.476 --> 00:31:42.376 A:middle
regions.

00:31:43.096 --> 00:31:43.986 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:31:43.986 --> 00:31:44.606 A:middle
copy that.

00:31:45.586 --> 00:31:47.426 A:middle
So what's the next step?

00:31:48.096 --> 00:31:50.266 A:middle
Well, we want to know more about

00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:52.326 A:middle
some virtual memory, so vmmap

00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:53.496 A:middle
seems like the place to go

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:53.986 A:middle
again.

00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:55.616 A:middle
This time, instead of the

00:31:55.616 --> 00:31:57.216 A:middle
summary flag, I'm just going to

00:31:57.216 --> 00:32:00.376 A:middle
pass my Memgraph file.
