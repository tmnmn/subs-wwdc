00:35:59.856 --> 00:36:02.346 A:middle
there's a tree view here of all

00:36:02.346 --> 00:36:03.336 A:middle
the things that have references,

00:36:03.336 --> 00:36:04.676 A:middle
and what references them, and

00:36:04.676 --> 00:36:06.006 A:middle
what references them, and so on

00:36:06.006 --> 00:36:06.616 A:middle
and so forth.

00:36:06.616 --> 00:36:08.646 A:middle
And in fact, if we go back to

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:11.026 A:middle
Xcode, and we actually filter on

00:36:11.026 --> 00:36:14.066 A:middle
the same address, and I go ahead

00:36:14.066 --> 00:36:16.766 A:middle
and look at this object, this

00:36:16.766 --> 00:36:18.406 A:middle
tree is the exact same tree I

00:36:18.406 --> 00:36:19.246 A:middle
see from leaks.

00:36:19.436 --> 00:36:20.626 A:middle
And if I wanted to, I could go

00:36:20.626 --> 00:36:22.146 A:middle
through and expand every single

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.876 A:middle
one of these nodes and look at

00:36:23.876 --> 00:36:25.436 A:middle
the details for each of them,

00:36:25.436 --> 00:36:26.946 A:middle
but that's going to take a

00:36:26.946 --> 00:36:28.306 A:middle
while, and it's kind of tedious.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.986 A:middle
The nice thing about the leaks

00:36:29.986 --> 00:36:32.566 A:middle
output is not only can I kind of

00:36:32.566 --> 00:36:33.946 A:middle
quickly scan through it, if I

00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:36.296 A:middle
want to, I can search or filter

00:36:36.296 --> 00:36:37.736 A:middle
it, or I can put it into a bug

00:36:37.736 --> 00:36:39.676 A:middle
report or an email, which I

00:36:39.676 --> 00:36:40.786 A:middle
can't really do with the

00:36:40.786 --> 00:36:42.786 A:middle
graphical view that's in Xcode.

00:36:43.686 --> 00:36:44.996 A:middle
So what am I looking for here in

00:36:44.996 --> 00:36:45.536 A:middle
this output?

00:36:46.116 --> 00:36:48.286 A:middle
Well, ideally, I would find

00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:49.876 A:middle
something, a class that I'm

00:36:49.876 --> 00:36:51.326 A:middle
responsible for, a class from my

00:36:51.326 --> 00:36:52.146 A:middle
application.

00:36:52.306 --> 00:36:54.066 A:middle
I happen to have looked through

00:36:54.066 --> 00:36:55.106 A:middle
this already, and I know there's

00:36:55.106 --> 00:36:56.846 A:middle
none of my classes in here, so

00:36:56.846 --> 00:36:57.976 A:middle
what's the next best thing?

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:00.236 A:middle
Well, a class that I know I'm
