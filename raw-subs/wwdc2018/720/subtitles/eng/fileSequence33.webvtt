00:33:00.056 --> 00:33:00.946 A:middle
And now, you can see we're

00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:02.536 A:middle
immediately asked if we want to

00:33:02.536 --> 00:33:03.446 A:middle
add the pass to Wallet.

00:33:03.446 --> 00:33:04.816 A:middle
And, you can see in the

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.666 A:middle
background code, the QR code is

00:33:06.746 --> 00:33:07.306 A:middle
no longer there.

00:33:07.456 --> 00:33:10.986 A:middle
And, the Add to Apple Wallet

00:33:10.986 --> 00:33:12.226 A:middle
button is replaced with the View

00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:12.896 A:middle
in Wallet button.

00:33:13.466 --> 00:33:14.976 A:middle
So, I want to add this pass to

00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:15.276 A:middle
Wallet.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:17.976 A:middle
And, let's go ahead and view it.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.456 A:middle
You see, we're immediately taken

00:33:21.456 --> 00:33:23.116 A:middle
to the pass, and you can see the

00:33:23.116 --> 00:33:24.436 A:middle
QR code is no longer on the

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:24.766 A:middle
front.

00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:26.596 A:middle
And, instead we have a Hold Near

00:33:26.596 --> 00:33:28.496 A:middle
Reader displayed at the bottom,

00:33:28.496 --> 00:33:29.856 A:middle
meaning that our pass is now

00:33:29.856 --> 00:33:32.496 A:middle
contactless, and I could scan it

00:33:32.496 --> 00:33:33.636 A:middle
a reader when I arrive at the

00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:33.966 A:middle
event.

00:33:35.436 --> 00:33:37.276 A:middle
Now, let's lock the device, and

00:33:37.276 --> 00:33:38.626 A:middle
since we're close to Discovery

00:33:38.626 --> 00:33:40.516 A:middle
Meadow here in San Jose, let's

00:33:40.516 --> 00:33:42.626 A:middle
see if the pass is relevant on

00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:42.976 A:middle
the lock screen.

00:33:46.176 --> 00:33:47.586 A:middle
Here's the notification for the

00:33:47.586 --> 00:33:49.646 A:middle
pass with the text that we set

00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:50.436 A:middle
in the JSON.

00:33:51.106 --> 00:33:52.306 A:middle
Let's tap our notification.

00:33:53.536 --> 00:33:54.466 A:middle
The pass is immediately

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.236 A:middle
displayed, and I happen to have

00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:57.976 A:middle
a contactless reader here on

00:33:57.976 --> 00:33:59.326 A:middle
stage, so let's simulate me

00:33:59.326 --> 00:33:59.976 A:middle
arriving at the event.
