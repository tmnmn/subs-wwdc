00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.096 A:middle
It's a great way to engage me.

00:35:01.336 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
It doesn't require me to browse

00:35:02.996 --> 00:35:04.086 A:middle
through all the items in the

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:04.296 A:middle
app.

00:35:05.256 --> 00:35:07.036 A:middle
You might be wondering why you

00:35:07.036 --> 00:35:08.056 A:middle
don't see the Apple Pay button

00:35:08.056 --> 00:35:08.486 A:middle
immediately.

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:10.246 A:middle
And, that's because I'm not

00:35:10.246 --> 00:35:11.166 A:middle
inside Caffe Macs.

00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:14.266 A:middle
As soon as I get close, using

00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:16.426 A:middle
GPS and Bluetooth beacons, the

00:35:16.426 --> 00:35:17.956 A:middle
app detects that change, and the

00:35:17.956 --> 00:35:18.576 A:middle
button appears.

00:35:19.546 --> 00:35:20.946 A:middle
This allows me to buy right from

00:35:20.946 --> 00:35:21.746 A:middle
the starting page.

00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:22.896 A:middle
It's a great example of

00:35:22.896 --> 00:35:23.326 A:middle
upstreaming.

00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:26.216 A:middle
Sometimes I order more than one

00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:27.416 A:middle
thing, and Caffe Macs has me

00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:27.716 A:middle
covered.

00:35:28.976 --> 00:35:30.526 A:middle
They support both the multi-item

00:35:30.646 --> 00:35:32.736 A:middle
express checkout, as well as a

00:35:32.736 --> 00:35:34.656 A:middle
single-item purchase flow right

00:35:34.656 --> 00:35:35.426 A:middle
from the product page.

00:35:36.526 --> 00:35:38.116 A:middle
I can also check out from

00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:39.636 A:middle
anywhere in the app, using the

00:35:39.636 --> 00:35:40.416 A:middle
Pay tab below.

00:35:40.416 --> 00:35:43.156 A:middle
Now, this is a great pattern to

00:35:43.156 --> 00:35:44.486 A:middle
follow to make checkout easy.

00:35:45.636 --> 00:35:47.726 A:middle
When I'm ready to pay, I Face

00:35:47.726 --> 00:35:48.776 A:middle
ID, and I'm done.

00:35:48.776 --> 00:35:51.516 A:middle
Here, you can see that following

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:52.756 A:middle
our guidelines, and requesting

00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:53.806 A:middle
as little information as

00:35:53.806 --> 00:35:54.216 A:middle
possible.

00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:56.376 A:middle
I'm already logged in across

00:35:56.376 --> 00:35:58.226 A:middle
multiple Apple apps, so no

00:35:58.226 --> 00:35:59.376 A:middle
additional fields are required.

00:35:59.376 --> 00:36:01.846 A:middle
However, if I wasn't, this would
