housekeeping.

00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:02.826 A:middle
If you are a payment processor,

00:38:03.086 --> 00:38:04.716 A:middle
or a merchant, most of you don't

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:06.296 A:middle
need to worry, but you should

00:38:06.296 --> 00:38:07.736 A:middle
just check your server-side

00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:08.836 A:middle
certificate expiry dates in the

00:38:08.836 --> 00:38:09.426 A:middle
developer portal.

00:38:10.326 --> 00:38:13.016 A:middle
They are easy to renew, and you

00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:15.136 A:middle
should renew before expiry to

00:38:15.136 --> 00:38:16.566 A:middle
avoid disruption taking Apple

00:38:17.246 --> 00:38:17.316 A:middle
Pay.

00:38:18.036 --> 00:38:19.256 A:middle
That's everything we have to

00:38:19.286 --> 00:38:19.936 A:middle
talk about today.

00:38:20.336 --> 00:38:21.686 A:middle
If you want to learn more, our

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.676 A:middle
online documentation can be

00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:24.186 A:middle
found here.

00:38:24.876 --> 00:38:25.846 A:middle
And, if you have any questions

00:38:25.846 --> 00:38:27.366 A:middle
about Wallet, Apple Pay, or Core

00:38:27.366 --> 00:38:29.386 A:middle
NFC, you can join us immediately

00:38:29.386 --> 00:38:30.966 A:middle
after this session in Technology

00:38:30.966 --> 00:38:33.326 A:middle
Lab 1 at 10 A.M. Thank you all

00:38:33.326 --> 00:38:34.386 A:middle
for coming today, and I hope

00:38:34.386 --> 00:38:35.366 A:middle
you've had a great WWDC.

00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:35.556 A:middle
Bye.
