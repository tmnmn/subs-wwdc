00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
button is clearly visible, and

00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:01.836 A:middle
easily reachable by the user.

00:10:03.156 --> 00:10:04.716 A:middle
If you apply these guidelines,

00:10:04.716 --> 00:10:05.896 A:middle
you can make it faster than ever

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:07.106 A:middle
for your users to checkout with

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.996 A:middle
Apple Pay.

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:11.606 A:middle
So, that's easier and faster

00:10:11.606 --> 00:10:13.046 A:middle
ways, but let's look at how to

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.656 A:middle
make things clearer with

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:15.196 A:middle
Streamlining.

00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:19.856 A:middle
Most important piece of

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:21.136 A:middle
information about Streamlining

00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:23.536 A:middle
for you, is to prefer customer

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:24.576 A:middle
information from Apple Pay.

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:27.686 A:middle
Users have this data already set

00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:29.486 A:middle
up, and you can make their

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:31.966 A:middle
experience clearer by using it.

00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:34.496 A:middle
When you request user's data,

00:10:34.846 --> 00:10:36.256 A:middle
it's important to only request

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:37.036 A:middle
relevant fields.

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:38.966 A:middle
Any additional fields that you

00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
add will only make things more

00:10:41.236 --> 00:10:41.576 A:middle
difficult.

00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:45.016 A:middle
If data is needed that Apple Pay

00:10:45.016 --> 00:10:46.476 A:middle
does not support, you should

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:47.496 A:middle
collect this before checkout

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:47.966 A:middle
begins.

00:10:48.156 --> 00:10:50.186 A:middle
For example, the number of items

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:51.576 A:middle
of a particular product, or a

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:52.766 A:middle
voucher code.

00:10:53.536 --> 00:10:55.256 A:middle
Now, this year, we've helped to

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:56.176 A:middle
streamline the Apple Pay

00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:58.496 A:middle
experience even further, by

00:10:58.496 --> 00:10:59.416 A:middle
making two changes.

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.676 A:middle
The first one I want to talk
