00:14:58.346 --> 00:15:01.216 A:middle
And, that's everything we have

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:02.326 A:middle
for covering Apple Pay today.

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:03.836 A:middle
So, now I want to move on to

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.236 A:middle
talking about getting the most

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:05.836 A:middle
from passes.

00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:10.356 A:middle
Passes are where it all began

00:15:10.356 --> 00:15:11.496 A:middle
for us, and they hold a very

00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:12.536 A:middle
special place in our hearts.

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:14.436 A:middle
And, we have some fantastic

00:15:14.436 --> 00:15:15.166 A:middle
improvements I'm going to tell

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:15.576 A:middle
you about.

00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:17.146 A:middle
But first, I just wanted to

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
recap what makes passes so

00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:18.916 A:middle
special.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.126 A:middle
They are so easy to use

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:24.066 A:middle
contactlessly or with a bar

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:24.306 A:middle
code.

00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:26.776 A:middle
And, they're synced across all

00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:28.096 A:middle
your devices using iCloud.

00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:30.896 A:middle
And, we're able to intelligently

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.616 A:middle
show them on the lock screen and

00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:33.766 A:middle
in Search for quick access.

00:15:34.286 --> 00:15:36.886 A:middle
And, they continue that seamless

00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:38.036 A:middle
Apple Pay experience into the

00:15:38.036 --> 00:15:39.476 A:middle
physical world, which works

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:40.976 A:middle
great for tickets, movie passes.

00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:44.736 A:middle
Those are great reasons why you

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:45.486 A:middle
should use passes.

00:15:46.186 --> 00:15:47.246 A:middle
But, how do you get the most

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.316 A:middle
from passes for your users?

00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:50.356 A:middle
Well, to do that we're going to

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:51.146 A:middle
cover four topics.

00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:53.736 A:middle
And, we're going to start by

00:15:53.736 --> 00:15:55.316 A:middle
talking about adding passes to

00:15:55.316 --> 00:15:55.696 A:middle
Wallet.

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:57.526 A:middle
And, we have some best practices

00:15:57.526 --> 00:15:58.386 A:middle
that you can follow.
