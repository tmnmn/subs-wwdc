00:36:58.526 --> 00:37:00.116 A:middle
In the checkout flow, the app

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:01.646 A:middle
offers the user a virtual

00:37:01.646 --> 00:37:04.516 A:middle
payment credential, issued by

00:37:04.746 --> 00:37:05.386 A:middle
[Chinese spoken], which uses our

00:37:05.386 --> 00:37:06.666 A:middle
in app provisioning flow to put

00:37:06.666 --> 00:37:08.106 A:middle
a card directly into Wallet.

00:37:08.936 --> 00:37:10.466 A:middle
Now, this works great even if

00:37:10.466 --> 00:37:12.366 A:middle
the user has no cards at all, in

00:37:12.366 --> 00:37:13.326 A:middle
Wallet or otherwise.

00:37:14.286 --> 00:37:15.866 A:middle
They can set one up, and order

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:16.396 A:middle
right away.

00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:18.706 A:middle
And, the card that's provisioned

00:37:19.186 --> 00:37:20.936 A:middle
can be used in all e-commerce,

00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:22.616 A:middle
and in-store merchants anywhere

00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:23.726 A:middle
in China that takes Apple Pay.

00:37:26.076 --> 00:37:26.946 A:middle
If you use a provisions

00:37:26.946 --> 00:37:27.686 A:middle
[inaudible] card into Wallet,

00:37:28.056 --> 00:37:29.646 A:middle
Apple Pay's the exclusive option

00:37:29.646 --> 00:37:30.256 A:middle
to checkout.

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:32.266 A:middle
Fantastic example of defaulting.

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:36.356 A:middle
As soon as I Face ID, the food

00:37:36.356 --> 00:37:36.736 A:middle
is ordered.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.796 A:middle
That's a fantastic experience

00:37:39.826 --> 00:37:40.806 A:middle
bringing together all of these

00:37:40.806 --> 00:37:43.476 A:middle
technologies: GPS, beacons, the

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:45.416 A:middle
camera, in-app provisioning, and

00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:46.146 A:middle
notifications.

00:37:47.156 --> 00:37:48.746 A:middle
If you combine that with a great

00:37:48.746 --> 00:37:50.736 A:middle
physical customer experience--

00:37:51.856 --> 00:37:52.816 A:middle
you know, if you leverage

00:37:52.816 --> 00:37:53.686 A:middle
everything we've shown you here

00:37:53.686 --> 00:37:55.586 A:middle
today, you too can build digital

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:56.496 A:middle
to physical commerce

00:37:56.496 --> 00:37:57.096 A:middle
experiences.

00:37:58.136 --> 00:37:59.596 A:middle
So, I have one piece of final

00:37:59.596 --> 00:38:00.126 A:middle
housekeeping.
