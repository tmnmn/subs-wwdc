00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.656 A:middle
the completion, and present that

00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:01.926 A:middle
viewController if requested.

00:17:03.026 --> 00:17:03.936 A:middle
In the demo you're going to see

00:17:03.936 --> 00:17:05.226 A:middle
later, you'll see how this

00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:06.146 A:middle
improves the experience.

00:17:06.146 --> 00:17:08.586 A:middle
So, let me tell you about some

00:17:08.586 --> 00:17:09.656 A:middle
other best practices to follow

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:10.415 A:middle
for adding passes.

00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:14.435 A:middle
Now, we suggest adding passes

00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:15.586 A:middle
that were created outside of

00:17:15.586 --> 00:17:17.596 A:middle
your experience, when the user

00:17:17.596 --> 00:17:18.465 A:middle
enters the app for the first

00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:19.526 A:middle
time, if they're coming from an

00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:20.566 A:middle
unsupported platform.

00:17:21.366 --> 00:17:22.185 A:middle
They've not previously had the

00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:23.376 A:middle
opportunity to add those passes,

00:17:23.695 --> 00:17:24.866 A:middle
and that's a great time to offer

00:17:24.866 --> 00:17:25.156 A:middle
it to them.

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:27.476 A:middle
And, you should add related

00:17:27.536 --> 00:17:30.286 A:middle
passes to Wallet in a group, to

00:17:30.286 --> 00:17:31.006 A:middle
reduce the friction.

00:17:31.956 --> 00:17:33.536 A:middle
And, you can make it easy for

00:17:33.536 --> 00:17:34.836 A:middle
people to quickly add passes

00:17:35.036 --> 00:17:36.546 A:middle
that they do not have from your

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
order history views, or previous

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.006 A:middle
transactions, for example.

00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:42.006 A:middle
And, from those same views, if

00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:43.446 A:middle
your user has a pass in Wallet

00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:44.946 A:middle
already, you should link them

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:45.626 A:middle
directly to it.

00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:47.496 A:middle
So that no matter where the user

00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:48.966 A:middle
starts their journey, in Wallet,

00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:50.816 A:middle
or your experience, they can get

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:52.686 A:middle
to the pass.

00:17:52.786 --> 00:17:54.056 A:middle
If you follow all these tips,

00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:55.666 A:middle
and use automatic pass adding,

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.146 A:middle
your users will love passes.

00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:00.226 A:middle
But, how do you make a pass that
