00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:00.226 A:middle
is displayed, account creation

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:00.806 A:middle
is now offered.

00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:02.986 A:middle
User's email address from the

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:04.726 A:middle
Apple Pay transaction has been

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:06.146 A:middle
used, and all the user has to do

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.746 A:middle
is enter a password to confirm

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:08.636 A:middle
the creation of the account.

00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:11.426 A:middle
You can make this even easier,

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.356 A:middle
using password AutoFill, and the

00:09:13.356 --> 00:09:14.846 A:middle
enhancements that we've added in

00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:15.306 A:middle
iOS 12.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.106 A:middle
So, that's everything for

00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:19.596 A:middle
upstreaming.

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:21.596 A:middle
Now, let's cover making things

00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:22.416 A:middle
faster with defaulting.

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:27.006 A:middle
Most important thing about

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:28.756 A:middle
defaulting is that your users

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:30.426 A:middle
will look for and expect Apple

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:30.656 A:middle
Pay.

00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:33.066 A:middle
So, you should make purchasing

00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:36.116 A:middle
faster by setting Apple Pay as

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:36.776 A:middle
the default option.

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:39.326 A:middle
And, Apple Pay is a great

00:09:39.326 --> 00:09:40.876 A:middle
default option, because it has

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:41.496 A:middle
the user's most up-to-date

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:41.976 A:middle
customer information.

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:46.196 A:middle
Even if the user has no card set

00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.476 A:middle
up in Apple Pay, as we showed

00:09:47.476 --> 00:09:48.896 A:middle
earlier, it still makes a great

00:09:48.896 --> 00:09:49.186 A:middle
option.

00:09:50.496 --> 00:09:51.426 A:middle
Let's see an example of

00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:52.236 A:middle
defaulting in action.

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:55.366 A:middle
Here we see Apple Pay as the

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:57.166 A:middle
default option right at the top,

00:09:57.566 --> 00:09:58.896 A:middle
and the Buy with Apple Pay

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
button is clearly visible, and
