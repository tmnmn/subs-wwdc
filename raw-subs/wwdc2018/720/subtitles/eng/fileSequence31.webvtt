00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:01.886 A:middle
And, if this is the case, you

00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.876 A:middle
should do what we did previously

00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:05.466 A:middle
and instantiate a

00:31:05.796 --> 00:31:07.426 A:middle
PKAddPassesViewController and

00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:07.906 A:middle
present it.

00:31:10.256 --> 00:31:11.436 A:middle
Now, let's go up to the

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:12.206 A:middle
viewDidLoad method.

00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:14.486 A:middle
As we saw, there was a QR code

00:31:14.486 --> 00:31:14.616 A:middle
here.

00:31:14.616 --> 00:31:18.086 A:middle
Again, if your pass has a QR

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:19.836 A:middle
code on the front, there's no

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:21.136 A:middle
need to have it in your app.

00:31:21.136 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
And, since our pass is now

00:31:22.396 --> 00:31:24.126 A:middle
NFC-capable, we don't need this

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:24.956 A:middle
view anymore.

00:31:25.146 --> 00:31:26.536 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and remove

00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:26.976 A:middle
these lines of code.

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:36.416 A:middle
Here is the PKAddPassButton, or

00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:38.856 A:middle
our Add to Wallet button.

00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:40.726 A:middle
In order to-- another way to

00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:42.606 A:middle
enhance the user's experience is

00:31:42.966 --> 00:31:44.536 A:middle
when the summary view is

00:31:44.566 --> 00:31:45.656 A:middle
presented right after they've

00:31:45.736 --> 00:31:47.126 A:middle
purchased the ticket, we

00:31:47.126 --> 00:31:49.786 A:middle
immediately ask them if they

00:31:49.786 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
want to add the pass to Wallet,

00:31:51.266 --> 00:31:52.556 A:middle
rather than having a button

00:31:52.556 --> 00:31:53.146 A:middle
onscreen.

00:31:54.076 --> 00:31:55.936 A:middle
Of course, you can have this Add

00:31:55.936 --> 00:31:57.686 A:middle
to Apple Wallet button somewhere

00:31:57.686 --> 00:31:58.866 A:middle
else in your app, if the user

00:31:58.866 --> 00:32:00.756 A:middle
decides to add the pass later.
