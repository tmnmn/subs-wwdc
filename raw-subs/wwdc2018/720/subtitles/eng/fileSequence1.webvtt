There's some updates to designs,

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:01.886 A:middle
and some new changes you can

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:03.106 A:middle
adopt for richer content.

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:06.096 A:middle
Finally, we will talk about

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.626 A:middle
digital to physical commerce.

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:09.106 A:middle
And, to do that I'm going to

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:10.816 A:middle
show you an example that we use

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:12.166 A:middle
every day at Apple Park, the

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.556 A:middle
Caffe Mac's app, and some

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:13.866 A:middle
others.

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:15.826 A:middle
So, let me first start by

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:16.686 A:middle
telling you about Apple Pay

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
Cash.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.696 A:middle
Apple Pay Cash makes it easy to

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:22.736 A:middle
get paid, and pay friends and

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:23.846 A:middle
family using iMessage.

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:26.776 A:middle
Now, you can pay in-store, with

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:27.956 A:middle
apps, and on the web.

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:29.776 A:middle
And, it's available in the U.S.

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:33.026 A:middle
Most importantly for you, ensure

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.006 A:middle
you accept Discover debit in

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:36.356 A:middle
your apps, and with your payment

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:38.486 A:middle
processor, so you can take Apple

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:38.996 A:middle
Pay Cash.

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:41.886 A:middle
Another feature that we

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.256 A:middle
announced last year, that is

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:45.306 A:middle
even a greater option, is inline

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:45.746 A:middle
setup.

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.626 A:middle
Now, inline setup lets your

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:50.666 A:middle
users with no cards set up one,

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:52.576 A:middle
and then return to the purchase

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:53.526 A:middle
in one step.

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:56.276 A:middle
All you have to do is always

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.236 A:middle
show the Apple Pay button if the

00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.176 A:middle
device supports it.
