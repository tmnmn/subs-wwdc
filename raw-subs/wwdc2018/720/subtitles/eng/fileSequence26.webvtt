[ Applause ]

00:26:07.246 --> 00:26:07.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ben.

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:10.766 A:middle
Hi, my name is Katie, and I'm an

00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:12.206 A:middle
engineer on the Wallet and Apple

00:26:12.326 --> 00:26:12.826 A:middle
Pay team.

00:26:13.526 --> 00:26:14.866 A:middle
Today, I'm going to be showing

00:26:14.866 --> 00:26:16.876 A:middle
you a Swift application, where a

00:26:16.876 --> 00:26:18.446 A:middle
user can purchase an event

00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:19.686 A:middle
ticket for a party that I'm

00:26:19.686 --> 00:26:21.006 A:middle
throwing this weekend for my

00:26:21.006 --> 00:26:21.376 A:middle
team.

00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:23.416 A:middle
My colleagues will be able to

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.376 A:middle
use the app in order to purchase

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:27.046 A:middle
a ticket, and make me a little

00:26:27.046 --> 00:26:27.836 A:middle
money on the side.

00:26:28.736 --> 00:26:30.436 A:middle
This app will demonstrate two

00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:30.796 A:middle
things.

00:26:31.816 --> 00:26:33.566 A:middle
First, how to use the best

00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:35.636 A:middle
practices and new API's that Ben

00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:37.376 A:middle
had mentioned earlier in order

00:26:37.376 --> 00:26:38.586 A:middle
to create the most seamless

00:26:38.826 --> 00:26:40.566 A:middle
Wallet and Apple Pay experience.

00:26:41.426 --> 00:26:44.566 A:middle
And, second, how to structure

00:26:44.566 --> 00:26:45.456 A:middle
your pass's JSON in order to

00:26:45.456 --> 00:26:46.856 A:middle
enhance your customer's

00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:47.376 A:middle
experience.

00:26:48.496 --> 00:26:51.016 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and take a

00:26:51.016 --> 00:26:51.976 A:middle
look at this app.

00:26:52.046 --> 00:26:53.676 A:middle
So, here we're presented with a

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.946 A:middle
summary about the event, a date,

00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:57.696 A:middle
a time, a location, and a cost.

00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:00.356 A:middle
Here's an example of
