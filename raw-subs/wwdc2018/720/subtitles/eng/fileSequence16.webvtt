00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:01.406 A:middle
Secondly, making passes look

00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:01.776 A:middle
great.

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:03.766 A:middle
There's some new design options,

00:16:03.936 --> 00:16:05.476 A:middle
and some tips for making passes

00:16:05.476 --> 00:16:06.856 A:middle
work across all your devices.

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:10.746 A:middle
Thirdly, rich pass content.

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:13.006 A:middle
New ways to make your passes

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:15.126 A:middle
more deeply integrate with the

00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:15.936 A:middle
system.

00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:17.696 A:middle
And, finally, contactless

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:19.786 A:middle
passes, and how you can get

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:20.836 A:middle
started.

00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:21.936 A:middle
So, let's begin with adding

00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:22.676 A:middle
passes to Wallet.

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:24.606 A:middle
Many of you have seen or

00:16:24.606 --> 00:16:26.026 A:middle
experienced the full model UI

00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:27.676 A:middle
that was presented to add

00:16:27.676 --> 00:16:28.336 A:middle
passes.

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:29.136 A:middle
But, there's a better way.

00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:33.636 A:middle
For almost all situations, we

00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:34.996 A:middle
recommend using our automatic

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:35.896 A:middle
pass adding API.

00:16:37.186 --> 00:16:39.176 A:middle
To use this, simply call the

00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.436 A:middle
addPasses function in

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:42.226 A:middle
PKPassLibrary, with the array of

00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:43.306 A:middle
passes you intend to add.

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:45.636 A:middle
Now, this presents a simple

00:16:45.636 --> 00:16:47.356 A:middle
alert to the user, requesting

00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:48.536 A:middle
them to add or to review those

00:16:48.536 --> 00:16:48.926 A:middle
passes.

00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.166 A:middle
And, that's much less friction

00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:52.146 A:middle
compared to the full-screen

00:16:52.146 --> 00:16:52.556 A:middle
model UI.

00:16:52.556 --> 00:16:55.026 A:middle
And, the user still has the

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.666 A:middle
option to review the passes in

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:56.946 A:middle
full.

00:16:57.436 --> 00:16:58.536 A:middle
And, you should handle that in

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.656 A:middle
the completion, and present that
