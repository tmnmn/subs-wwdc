00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:00.906 A:middle
to the user for billing and

00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:01.626 A:middle
shipping issues.

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:03.596 A:middle
And, that's so they can more

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:05.256 A:middle
easily resolve those issues, and

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:06.136 A:middle
get back to purchasing.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:08.286 A:middle
And, that's great for higher

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:08.766 A:middle
conversion.

00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:11.176 A:middle
Now, some tips for error

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:11.596 A:middle
handling.

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:13.776 A:middle
One thing we want to make clear,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.096 A:middle
is that it's still important to

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:17.296 A:middle
expect fuzzy data.

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:19.826 A:middle
The user has one set of data in

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:21.196 A:middle
Apple Pay, and that's shared

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:23.136 A:middle
across many apps and websites.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.826 A:middle
And, we don't want the user--

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.586 A:middle
don't want to force the user to

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:27.836 A:middle
conform to everybody's

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.616 A:middle
individual business logic, as

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.066 A:middle
that requires the user to

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.716 A:middle
reenter information, which just

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:35.406 A:middle
increases friction, and will

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:36.866 A:middle
reduce your overall conversion

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:37.026 A:middle
rate.

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:39.856 A:middle
Instead, you should do your best

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.276 A:middle
to accept a range of inputs.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.416 A:middle
For example, Zip and Zip + 4.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:46.196 A:middle
And, infer what details you can

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:48.066 A:middle
from other fields such as city

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.036 A:middle
and state from Zip.

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
Now, that's not all the features

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:52.566 A:middle
that we announced.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.556 A:middle
We also launched in some new

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:54.106 A:middle
countries.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.546 A:middle
And, you may remember this slide

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:57.186 A:middle
from last year.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:03:59.996 A:middle
Well, this year, we're

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:00.746 A:middle
introducing the following
