00:31:58.866 --> 00:32:00.756 A:middle
decides to add the pass later.

00:32:02.216 --> 00:32:03.386 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and remove

00:32:03.386 --> 00:32:03.986 A:middle
this button.

00:32:03.986 --> 00:32:08.216 A:middle
And, instead, we're going to

00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:10.446 A:middle
replace it with a View in Wallet

00:32:10.446 --> 00:32:10.776 A:middle
button.

00:32:14.046 --> 00:32:15.776 A:middle
That way, the user can tap this

00:32:15.776 --> 00:32:16.946 A:middle
button, and they'll be brought

00:32:16.946 --> 00:32:18.366 A:middle
directly to a Wallet, and be

00:32:18.366 --> 00:32:19.606 A:middle
shown the pass that they just

00:32:19.776 --> 00:32:19.966 A:middle
added.

00:32:22.606 --> 00:32:25.366 A:middle
And, finally, when the view is

00:32:25.426 --> 00:32:27.046 A:middle
presented, let's immediately ask

00:32:27.126 --> 00:32:27.886 A:middle
them if they want to add the

00:32:27.886 --> 00:32:27.976 A:middle
pass.

00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:32.706 A:middle
Now, that we've made these

00:32:32.706 --> 00:32:34.416 A:middle
changes, let's deploy to the

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.866 A:middle
device, and see what it looks

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:35.976 A:middle
like.

00:32:45.356 --> 00:32:46.356 A:middle
Again, we're presented with the

00:32:46.356 --> 00:32:48.496 A:middle
same view, a summary about the

00:32:48.786 --> 00:32:48.996 A:middle
event.

00:32:48.996 --> 00:32:50.376 A:middle
I'll go ahead and purchase this

00:32:50.376 --> 00:32:50.976 A:middle
pass again.
