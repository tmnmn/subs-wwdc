00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:01.106 A:middle
We support values of 0 and 1,

00:20:01.106 --> 00:20:02.506 A:middle
and that's going to be coming to

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
you in a future seed.

00:20:04.456 --> 00:20:06.216 A:middle
On older versions, "row" will be

00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:06.626 A:middle
ignored.

00:20:07.356 --> 00:20:09.256 A:middle
And, in that case, auxiliary

00:20:09.256 --> 00:20:10.366 A:middle
fields will be displayed on one

00:20:10.366 --> 00:20:13.206 A:middle
row, up to a limit of 4 fields

00:20:13.206 --> 00:20:13.626 A:middle
per row.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.096 A:middle
So, make sure you consider this

00:20:16.096 --> 00:20:17.166 A:middle
when designing your passes.

00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:18.996 A:middle
And, test across supported

00:20:18.996 --> 00:20:20.206 A:middle
devices and versions.

00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:24.476 A:middle
So now, we've got passes in

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:25.756 A:middle
Wallet, looking great.

00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:27.906 A:middle
How do we make that content even

00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:28.186 A:middle
richer?

00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:31.346 A:middle
Let's get the most from a pass.

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.266 A:middle
You can include information that

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.696 A:middle
the system can leverage to

00:20:34.696 --> 00:20:35.816 A:middle
provide the user enhanced

00:20:35.816 --> 00:20:36.506 A:middle
experiences.

00:20:37.356 --> 00:20:38.326 A:middle
And, one of those you may

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:39.306 A:middle
already know about, is

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:39.836 A:middle
relevancy.

00:20:40.396 --> 00:20:43.196 A:middle
You can add relevancy by setting

00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:45.766 A:middle
the locations, relevantText, and

00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:47.276 A:middle
relevantDate pass JSON fields.

00:20:47.796 --> 00:20:50.676 A:middle
And, this allows the system to

00:20:50.676 --> 00:20:51.836 A:middle
present the pass to the user

00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:53.136 A:middle
just at the right moment.

00:20:54.026 --> 00:20:55.436 A:middle
We handle multiple relevant

00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:55.866 A:middle
passes.

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:57.966 A:middle
And, if you're issuing passes

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.436 A:middle
for a single journey, multiple

00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:01.516 A:middle
ones, then you should make sure
