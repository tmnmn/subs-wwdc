00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:00.366 A:middle
from the pass JSON.

00:22:01.626 --> 00:22:02.486 A:middle
This film's called "Revenge of

00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:03.026 A:middle
the Passes."

00:22:03.516 --> 00:22:05.056 A:middle
It's showing at Apple Park, and

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:06.186 A:middle
it's running for two hours and

00:22:06.186 --> 00:22:07.476 A:middle
45 minutes in theater F5.

00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:09.606 A:middle
Now, that's all the information

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:11.386 A:middle
I'm going to need when I get

00:22:11.716 --> 00:22:12.596 A:middle
there to see the film.

00:22:12.596 --> 00:22:13.586 A:middle
And, it's going to be readily

00:22:13.586 --> 00:22:14.176 A:middle
available to me.

00:22:15.556 --> 00:22:16.776 A:middle
So, let's take that event field

00:22:16.776 --> 00:22:17.716 A:middle
at the top, and add some

00:22:17.716 --> 00:22:19.186 A:middle
semantic tags to it.

00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:22.256 A:middle
To do that, we add a semantics

00:22:22.256 --> 00:22:23.236 A:middle
dictionary to the field.

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:25.766 A:middle
And, inside that dictionary, you

00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:27.036 A:middle
can have relevant key names from

00:22:27.036 --> 00:22:29.046 A:middle
my documentation to provide

00:22:29.046 --> 00:22:30.176 A:middle
machine-readable content.

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:33.336 A:middle
For example, with the movie, the

00:22:33.336 --> 00:22:35.066 A:middle
name used for display may differ

00:22:35.166 --> 00:22:36.786 A:middle
from the full official name used

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:37.446 A:middle
internationally.

00:22:38.216 --> 00:22:39.526 A:middle
And the same might apply to your

00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:40.026 A:middle
venue name.

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:41.936 A:middle
These should be the official

00:22:41.936 --> 00:22:43.486 A:middle
names that are different from

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:43.966 A:middle
display.

00:22:45.546 --> 00:22:46.466 A:middle
You're also able to add

00:22:46.646 --> 00:22:48.626 A:middle
additional related data that is

00:22:48.626 --> 00:22:49.906 A:middle
not important for display, but

00:22:50.316 --> 00:22:51.706 A:middle
associated with that field.

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:54.476 A:middle
For example, the phone number.

00:22:54.526 --> 00:22:55.896 A:middle
Now, sometimes, you have

00:22:55.896 --> 00:22:57.526 A:middle
semantic data that is not

00:22:57.526 --> 00:22:58.756 A:middle
associated with fields.

00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:01.406 A:middle
And, to capture that, we can use
