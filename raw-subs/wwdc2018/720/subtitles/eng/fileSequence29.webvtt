00:28:59.086 --> 00:29:00.696 A:middle
And, instead, let's replace it

00:29:00.696 --> 00:29:01.956 A:middle
with an NFC dictionary.

00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:06.286 A:middle
Here, this dictionary contains

00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:07.446 A:middle
information that we've passed

00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:09.676 A:middle
from the device to the reader in

00:29:09.676 --> 00:29:11.306 A:middle
order to identify them when they

00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:12.446 A:middle
check in.

00:29:13.196 --> 00:29:15.496 A:middle
Next, let's add location data to

00:29:15.496 --> 00:29:17.026 A:middle
this pass, so it can become

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:18.206 A:middle
relevant on the lock screen.

00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.006 A:middle
Here, we set a latitude, a

00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:25.476 A:middle
longitude, in this case it's

00:29:25.476 --> 00:29:27.286 A:middle
Discovery Meadow, and relevant

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:28.446 A:middle
text that will be displayed in

00:29:28.446 --> 00:29:29.716 A:middle
the notification on the lock

00:29:29.776 --> 00:29:29.976 A:middle
screen.

00:29:32.066 --> 00:29:33.776 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:35.716 A:middle
Swift application, in order to

00:29:35.716 --> 00:29:37.016 A:middle
see what changes we can make

00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:37.706 A:middle
there as well.

00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:42.666 A:middle
Let's first take a look at this

00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:44.156 A:middle
presentAddPass method.

00:29:44.836 --> 00:29:47.086 A:middle
This was called when we tapped

00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:47.976 A:middle
the Add to Wallet button.

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:52.176 A:middle
Here, we got the pass from a

00:29:52.176 --> 00:29:53.276 A:middle
function we called, called

00:29:53.276 --> 00:29:53.666 A:middle
eventPass.

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:56.396 A:middle
Let's go ahead and replace this

00:29:56.396 --> 00:29:57.686 A:middle
with our newly modified pass.
