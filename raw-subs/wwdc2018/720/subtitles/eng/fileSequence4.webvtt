00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:00.746 A:middle
introducing the following

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:03.596 A:middle
countries, and we're also coming

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:04.796 A:middle
to Norway and Poland soon.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:07.906 A:middle
Now, that's a great range.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:08.996 A:middle
But, one country I want to talk

00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:10.426 A:middle
about in particular, is China.

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:14.386 A:middle
This year, we've taken Express

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.596 A:middle
Transit to China, launching with

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:18.046 A:middle
Beijing Transit, and Shanghai

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:18.486 A:middle
Transit.

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.296 A:middle
Now, this works fantastically.

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:22.106 A:middle
You can buy a card directly from

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:23.186 A:middle
Wallet, and get going

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:23.666 A:middle
straightaway.

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:26.626 A:middle
But, Transit is not limited to

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:27.256 A:middle
China alone.

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:29.556 A:middle
You can use Apple Pay to ride

00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:30.736 A:middle
throughout the world, anywhere

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.016 A:middle
credit and debit cards are

00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:33.966 A:middle
accepted, such as Moscow and

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:34.216 A:middle
London.

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:36.466 A:middle
Well, that's it from updates

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:37.466 A:middle
from the last year.

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:39.656 A:middle
Let's talk about creating great

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:40.886 A:middle
Apple Pay experiences.

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:43.916 A:middle
What is a great experience with

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.976 A:middle
Apple Pay?

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:48.126 A:middle
Well, it's one that is easier,

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.636 A:middle
by allowing the user to checkout

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:52.376 A:middle
as early as possible, with what

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:53.366 A:middle
we call upstreaming.

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:56.426 A:middle
It's one that is faster, by

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.816 A:middle
making Apple Pay the default

00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:59.226 A:middle
payment option, with what we

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:00.026 A:middle
call defaulting.
