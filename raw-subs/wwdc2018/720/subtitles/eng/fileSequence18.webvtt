00:17:57.646 --> 00:18:00.226 A:middle
But, how do you make a pass that

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:00.866 A:middle
looks great?

00:18:03.296 --> 00:18:04.536 A:middle
Most important information for

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:06.946 A:middle
you is that the pass fields that

00:18:06.946 --> 00:18:08.836 A:middle
you display to the user should

00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:10.496 A:middle
have the relevant and critical

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:12.596 A:middle
information on them.

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:13.386 A:middle
And, there're things that the

00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:14.586 A:middle
user definitely needs.

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:16.856 A:middle
And, you can make them stand out

00:18:16.856 --> 00:18:18.016 A:middle
by using vibrant colors.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.966 A:middle
And, you should design a pass

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.266 A:middle
that looks great across all your

00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:22.846 A:middle
devices.

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:26.836 A:middle
Now, to do that, you want to

00:18:26.836 --> 00:18:28.796 A:middle
avoid reproducing existing

00:18:28.796 --> 00:18:30.506 A:middle
passes, physical ones.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.816 A:middle
We have some great templates,

00:18:33.126 --> 00:18:35.156 A:middle
and layout options to make these

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.016 A:middle
fields stand out and make sure

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.426 A:middle
that your entire audience can

00:18:40.426 --> 00:18:41.236 A:middle
work with these passes as

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:41.846 A:middle
they're accessible.

00:18:44.306 --> 00:18:45.926 A:middle
And, secondly don't encode user

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:47.256 A:middle
information inside the strip

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:48.286 A:middle
image that we can see here.

00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:50.226 A:middle
You should reserve that for the

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:50.736 A:middle
fields.

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:53.266 A:middle
That's particularly important on

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:53.706 A:middle
Apple Watch.

00:18:53.706 --> 00:18:55.956 A:middle
Because there's no space to

00:18:55.956 --> 00:18:56.686 A:middle
display that.

00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.216 A:middle
And, the fields are front and

00:18:58.216 --> 00:18:58.546 A:middle
center.

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:01.776 A:middle
