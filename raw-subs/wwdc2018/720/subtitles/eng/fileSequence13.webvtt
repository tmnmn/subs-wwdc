00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:01.286 A:middle
Now, that it's announced, you

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:02.366 A:middle
may be wondering if you should

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:03.966 A:middle
be using that, or our existing

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:05.136 A:middle
Apple Pay JavaScript API.

00:13:06.456 --> 00:13:07.776 A:middle
Let's compare the benefits of

00:13:07.776 --> 00:13:09.396 A:middle
using one over the other.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.246 A:middle
The Payment Request API is a

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:14.486 A:middle
cross browser solution, however,

00:13:14.486 --> 00:13:15.866 A:middle
it's important to know that

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:17.526 A:middle
Apple Pay is only supported on

00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:18.006 A:middle
Safari.

00:13:19.336 --> 00:13:20.486 A:middle
If you choose the Payment

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:23.096 A:middle
Request API, you do miss out on

00:13:23.096 --> 00:13:24.236 A:middle
some of the following features.

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:26.816 A:middle
Error handling with custom error

00:13:26.816 --> 00:13:28.046 A:middle
messaging, as I showed you

00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:28.326 A:middle
earlier.

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:31.266 A:middle
But also, automatic selection of

00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:33.016 A:middle
affiliated and cobranded cards.

00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:35.716 A:middle
And, therefore, your ability to

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:37.326 A:middle
adjust prices of the user's

00:13:37.326 --> 00:13:38.236 A:middle
selection of these cards.

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:40.726 A:middle
In markets and regions where

00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:42.436 A:middle
it's important, phonetic name

00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:43.616 A:middle
collection is also not

00:13:43.616 --> 00:13:44.046 A:middle
supported.

00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:46.626 A:middle
And, the Apple Pay JavaScript

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.216 A:middle
API has a wider range of

00:13:48.216 --> 00:13:50.386 A:middle
support, going back to iOS 10,

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:51.696 A:middle
and macOS 10.12.

00:13:53.136 --> 00:13:54.566 A:middle
Now, you should evaluate what

00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:55.326 A:middle
makes sense for you.

00:13:55.766 --> 00:13:56.666 A:middle
And, if you choose the Payment

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.976 A:middle
Request API, consider using the
