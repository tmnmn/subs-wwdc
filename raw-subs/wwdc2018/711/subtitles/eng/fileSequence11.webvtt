00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.106 A:middle
notification group for these

00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:02.956 A:middle
group conversation.

00:11:03.756 --> 00:11:06.636 A:middle
Just generates any group

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.606 A:middle
identifier for that thread and

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:09.566 A:middle
they get grouped together.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.076 A:middle
It can expand and see, still see

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.036 A:middle
all my messages.

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:20.316 A:middle
So what does-- what is the

00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:21.386 A:middle
lesson that we learned from

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:22.016 A:middle
Messages?

00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:24.456 A:middle
Create groups for meaningful,

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:25.816 A:middle
personal communications.

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:27.576 A:middle
These notifications from

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:30.226 A:middle
Messages are usually important.

00:11:30.616 --> 00:11:33.856 A:middle
And they live very shortly in

00:11:33.856 --> 00:11:34.766 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:11:34.766 --> 00:11:37.146 A:middle
So we can create many separate

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:38.716 A:middle
groups for all of them.

00:11:42.896 --> 00:11:44.756 A:middle
Our final example is Mail.

00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:49.376 A:middle
And Mail shares some of the same

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.056 A:middle
characteristics that Messages

00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:51.476 A:middle
has.

00:11:52.236 --> 00:11:54.586 A:middle
So they're often direct

00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:55.896 A:middle
communications with people.

00:11:56.626 --> 00:12:01.376 A:middle
They have a same, a similar
