00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.186 A:middle
notifications more efficient for

00:07:01.186 --> 00:07:01.696 A:middle
the user.

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:03.956 A:middle
And improve the organization in

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:04.936 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:06.496 A:middle
I'm sure you're familiar with

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:09.386 A:middle
the situation where one app has

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:10.716 A:middle
sent many notifications.

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:12.286 A:middle
Maybe you're in a chatty,

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:14.176 A:middle
messages conversations and

00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:15.456 A:middle
someone is sending a lot of

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:16.066 A:middle
messages.

00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:17.926 A:middle
We want to improve that

00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:19.966 A:middle
situation by organizing

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:21.136 A:middle
notifications a little bit

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:23.076 A:middle
better so that the user can use

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:23.976 A:middle
them more effectively.

00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:30.246 A:middle
Our first example is Calendar.

00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:35.456 A:middle
Depending on how you organize

00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:37.006 A:middle
your life or where you work,

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:39.016 A:middle
Calendar may send you a lot of

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:41.886 A:middle
notifications for event changes,

00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:42.796 A:middle
event invites.

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:45.816 A:middle
But not all of them have the

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:46.806 A:middle
same importance.

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:48.356 A:middle
There are some notifications

00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:49.676 A:middle
that are sent by Calendar that

00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:52.576 A:middle
are more important than others.

00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:56.436 A:middle
And they are event alerts that

00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:57.596 A:middle
you set up when you create an

00:07:57.596 --> 00:07:57.916 A:middle
event.

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
Or time to leave notifications.
