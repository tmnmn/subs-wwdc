00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.666 A:middle
it, and see the details inside

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:00.976 A:middle
the group.

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:08.606 A:middle
So app grouping is good.

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.416 A:middle
It keeps notifications more

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.626 A:middle
organized and Notification

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.286 A:middle
Center more compact and easier

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:13.776 A:middle
to use.

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:17.726 A:middle
But many apps have more specific

00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:18.245 A:middle
content.

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:20.136 A:middle
They may need different

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:21.716 A:middle
organization to make

00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:23.546 A:middle
notifications more efficient.

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:26.866 A:middle
And so we can create custom

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:27.206 A:middle
grouping.

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:29.436 A:middle
So in this session we will see

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:32.876 A:middle
first the API to create custom

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:34.226 A:middle
groups for your notifications.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.296 A:middle
And then we'll look at a few

00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:41.546 A:middle
examples of apps in iOS 12 to

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:42.966 A:middle
explore some of the patterns

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.346 A:middle
that they applied, and how they

00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:47.846 A:middle
tried to balance the amount of

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:49.226 A:middle
content that was visible to the

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
user.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:50.796 A:middle
And the amount of content that

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:53.476 A:middle
was grouped together to help

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:54.416 A:middle
with the organization of

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.976 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:59.646 A:middle
So this is how you create a

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
group for your app.
