00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
group for your app.

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.166 A:middle
You just set a custom thread

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.746 A:middle
identifier in the notification

00:05:05.746 --> 00:05:06.246 A:middle
content.

00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
After you've done this, all the

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
notifications that you send with

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
the same thread identifier will

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:15.926 A:middle
be grouped together in

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.806 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:20.426 A:middle
The thread identifier can be any

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:20.846 A:middle
string.

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:22.966 A:middle
Doesn't matter what you said

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:23.296 A:middle
there.

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:25.436 A:middle
But all of the notification will

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:26.096 A:middle
be grouped together.

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:28.606 A:middle
You just need to be unique.

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
You just need a unique string

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.756 A:middle
that is identifier's group.

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:33.646 A:middle
And that is it.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:35.646 A:middle
You created a groups for your

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
notifications.

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:40.836 A:middle
But given that it is so simple,

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.306 A:middle
we need to pay attention at how

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
we create these groups.

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:47.656 A:middle
And also, if you're familiar

00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:49.796 A:middle
with notifications API, you

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:51.156 A:middle
notice that this is not a new

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:51.386 A:middle
API.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.936 A:middle
This is an API that we

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.906 A:middle
introduced in previous iOS

00:05:54.906 --> 00:05:55.316 A:middle
releases.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:57.256 A:middle
So it's a really existing and

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.426 A:middle
current iOS.

00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:00.726 A:middle
We introduced it to, for
