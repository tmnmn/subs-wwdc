00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.486 A:middle
numerical placeholder.

00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.136 A:middle
When you don't need the

00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:04.696 A:middle
arguments and you need to

00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:07.496 A:middle
specify an unsigned number.

00:27:09.206 --> 00:27:10.996 A:middle
And the second format that you

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.216 A:middle
need, you can use is the one

00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:14.686 A:middle
with the numerical placeholder

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.166 A:middle
and the string placeholder.

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:19.196 A:middle
We will automatically detect

00:27:19.496 --> 00:27:20.966 A:middle
which string you are using and

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:21.976 A:middle
format them correctly.

00:27:27.426 --> 00:27:29.416 A:middle
Now we're all done with the

00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.636 A:middle
features of notification

00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:32.046 A:middle
grouping.

00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:34.376 A:middle
But before you leave, I want to

00:27:34.376 --> 00:27:35.786 A:middle
give you a couple more tips

00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:37.986 A:middle
about notification grouping and

00:27:37.986 --> 00:27:40.026 A:middle
these API that will help you

00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:42.766 A:middle
finish the last bit of polish in

00:27:42.766 --> 00:27:44.546 A:middle
your app.

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:48.396 A:middle
The first step is about

00:27:48.396 --> 00:27:52.416 A:middle
combining different summaries.

00:27:52.616 --> 00:27:54.606 A:middle
Since we saw that you can set

00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:57.136 A:middle
different summaries in different

00:27:57.136 --> 00:27:57.786 A:middle
categories.

00:27:58.186 --> 00:28:00.816 A:middle
And the thread group are defined
