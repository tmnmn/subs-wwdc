00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:01.936 A:middle
And when you do that, you always

00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:04.606 A:middle
need to account for different

00:23:04.606 --> 00:23:06.256 A:middle
languages and you need to

00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:07.646 A:middle
account for plurals in this

00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:07.966 A:middle
case.

00:23:07.966 --> 00:23:09.036 A:middle
Because we have numbers.

00:23:11.816 --> 00:23:13.756 A:middle
Again, another Podcast

00:23:13.756 --> 00:23:14.376 A:middle
notification.

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:15.536 A:middle
For example, in this case.

00:23:15.846 --> 00:23:17.206 A:middle
It says, "Four more episodes."

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.576 A:middle
But if I only had one more

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:21.796 A:middle
episode, that string would need

00:23:21.796 --> 00:23:22.496 A:middle
to be different.

00:23:23.266 --> 00:23:24.996 A:middle
But the API only allows us to

00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:25.816 A:middle
set one string.

00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:29.536 A:middle
And now we need two.

00:23:29.786 --> 00:23:30.986 A:middle
You need two in English.

00:23:31.766 --> 00:23:33.826 A:middle
But if you want to start to

00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:36.826 A:middle
localize your app or if your

00:23:36.826 --> 00:23:38.316 A:middle
main language is not English,

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:39.496 A:middle
you're writing up for a

00:23:39.496 --> 00:23:40.386 A:middle
different language.

00:23:41.136 --> 00:23:43.156 A:middle
Some languages have different

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:44.226 A:middle
rules for plurals.

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.126 A:middle
They may not have two cases.

00:23:46.156 --> 00:23:47.006 A:middle
They may have three.

00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:49.156 A:middle
And they may have cases that

00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:50.116 A:middle
apply with different rules.

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:54.766 A:middle
So iOS in the foundation

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.926 A:middle
frameworks provides support for

00:23:56.926 --> 00:23:57.986 A:middle
localizing these kind of

00:23:57.986 --> 00:23:58.446 A:middle
strings.

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:00.546 A:middle
So you don't need to learn all
