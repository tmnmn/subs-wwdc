00:30:59.336 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
As you see in my examples, for

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:03.036 A:middle
example in podcasts or in Mail,

00:31:03.776 --> 00:31:05.446 A:middle
just that little bit of text

00:31:05.556 --> 00:31:07.826 A:middle
underneath the notification

00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:09.736 A:middle
group will help to see what else

00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:10.916 A:middle
is new in that group.

00:31:11.306 --> 00:31:12.716 A:middle
And I don't need to open the

00:31:12.716 --> 00:31:14.606 A:middle
notification group just to see

00:31:15.486 --> 00:31:16.876 A:middle
everything about the content.

00:31:16.876 --> 00:31:19.226 A:middle
The summary already gives some

00:31:19.226 --> 00:31:19.846 A:middle
information.

00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:23.676 A:middle
We will have a lab shortly right

00:31:23.676 --> 00:31:25.866 A:middle
after this session, downstairs.

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:27.706 A:middle
We will have another lab

00:31:28.056 --> 00:31:29.796 A:middle
tomorrow morning, and we look

00:31:29.796 --> 00:31:30.796 A:middle
forward to talking to you.

00:31:31.186 --> 00:31:33.656 A:middle
And on Friday, there is another

00:31:33.656 --> 00:31:35.686 A:middle
session about notifications that

00:31:35.686 --> 00:31:37.206 A:middle
talks a little bit more about

00:31:37.206 --> 00:31:38.346 A:middle
the design aspects.

00:31:38.456 --> 00:31:40.696 A:middle
About how to think about your

00:31:40.696 --> 00:31:42.446 A:middle
notifications globally across

00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:44.196 A:middle
all the user devices and across

00:31:44.196 --> 00:31:45.766 A:middle
different systems.

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.176 A:middle
Thank you very much, and I'll

00:31:49.176 --> 00:31:49.696 A:middle
see you later.

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:52.508 A:middle
