00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
So we can use that to organize

00:15:00.926 --> 00:15:01.976 A:middle
notifications that Mail sends.

00:15:10.246 --> 00:15:12.196 A:middle
So now that we've seen how to

00:15:12.196 --> 00:15:14.566 A:middle
create as many groups as we

00:15:14.566 --> 00:15:18.776 A:middle
want, we'll see how to make

00:15:18.776 --> 00:15:20.146 A:middle
these groups a little bit more

00:15:20.146 --> 00:15:20.656 A:middle
clear.

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:22.106 A:middle
By providing some bits of

00:15:22.106 --> 00:15:23.926 A:middle
information in the group.

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:27.576 A:middle
That describes the content that

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:28.136 A:middle
they contain.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.216 A:middle
As we see in these example of my

00:15:33.216 --> 00:15:34.576 A:middle
Notification Center from last

00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:34.726 A:middle
week.

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:37.446 A:middle
Each group has a little short

00:15:37.446 --> 00:15:38.486 A:middle
summary at the bottom.

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:39.936 A:middle
And it explains a little bit of

00:15:39.936 --> 00:15:41.076 A:middle
what that group is about.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.136 A:middle
For example, you see Mail says

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:45.136 A:middle
that I have a few emails from in

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:46.076 A:middle
my work account.

00:15:47.466 --> 00:15:49.116 A:middle
Podcasts is telling me that I

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.456 A:middle
have a bunch of new episodes

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:52.186 A:middle
that were delivered to my

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:56.496 A:middle
Podcasts app to listen.

00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:59.166 A:middle
And News tells me I have nine

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
more notifications from National
