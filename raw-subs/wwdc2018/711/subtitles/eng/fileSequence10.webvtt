00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.256 A:middle
Our next example is Messages.

00:10:02.796 --> 00:10:04.776 A:middle
Messages is maybe the most

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.676 A:middle
straightforward notification

00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:07.706 A:middle
group's implementation.

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:09.936 A:middle
It's pretty obvious.

00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:11.566 A:middle
Messages has conversations.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:13.866 A:middle
And each conversation has its

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:14.846 A:middle
own group.

00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:17.886 A:middle
But we still, we can still learn

00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:18.716 A:middle
something important.

00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:20.446 A:middle
We can still learn a good lesson

00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:21.276 A:middle
from Messages.

00:10:21.906 --> 00:10:24.866 A:middle
Why is it that Messages separate

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:26.706 A:middle
all these groups in different

00:10:26.706 --> 00:10:27.936 A:middle
conv-- different conversation in

00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:28.626 A:middle
different groups?

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:31.116 A:middle
Well notifications that Messages

00:10:31.116 --> 00:10:34.386 A:middle
sends are generally from people.

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:35.496 A:middle
From your friends, from your

00:10:35.496 --> 00:10:35.926 A:middle
family.

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:37.406 A:middle
They're notifications that we

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:39.526 A:middle
care about, that are important.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.476 A:middle
And second they're notifications

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:44.006 A:middle
that usually are short-lived.

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:45.636 A:middle
Because usually you respond

00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:46.786 A:middle
pretty quickly at a Message.

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:48.596 A:middle
And it will go away from

00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:50.116 A:middle
Notifications Center.

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.746 A:middle
So what Messages does is it

00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:56.036 A:middle
creates a thread for these

00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:57.946 A:middle
one-to-one conversation.

00:10:57.946 --> 00:10:59.546 A:middle
And it creates a separate

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.106 A:middle
notification group for these
