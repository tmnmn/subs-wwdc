00:12:58.726 --> 00:13:01.186 A:middle
provides some features to

00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:03.186 A:middle
already organize and prioritize

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:04.876 A:middle
the emails that arrive in your

00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:05.336 A:middle
inbox.

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:09.226 A:middle
Mail provides separate accounts.

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.296 A:middle
You can have many different

00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:12.116 A:middle
accounts set up in your device.

00:13:13.116 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
Provides VIP.

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:17.556 A:middle
You can set any contact as VIP.

00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:20.596 A:middle
You can create-- you can have

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:21.666 A:middle
favorite folders.

00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:23.326 A:middle
And you can turn on

00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:24.696 A:middle
notifications for specific

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:27.746 A:middle
threads inside your mail client.

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:31.116 A:middle
And so it seems like the user is

00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:33.156 A:middle
already telling us which

00:13:33.156 --> 00:13:34.026 A:middle
notifications are more

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:34.566 A:middle
important.

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:35.746 A:middle
Which email messages are more

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:37.036 A:middle
important and which are less

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:37.616 A:middle
important.

00:13:37.926 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
And that is what Mail does.

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:43.116 A:middle
Mail organizes notifications

00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:44.766 A:middle
first by starting with the

00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:45.896 A:middle
account group.

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:48.186 A:middle
It creates one big account for

00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:49.926 A:middle
all the emails that arrive in a

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:50.776 A:middle
specific account.

00:13:51.786 --> 00:13:53.546 A:middle
If I had multiple accounts, each

00:13:53.546 --> 00:13:55.566 A:middle
one would get its own group.

00:13:56.316 --> 00:14:00.016 A:middle
But then if a contact that is in
