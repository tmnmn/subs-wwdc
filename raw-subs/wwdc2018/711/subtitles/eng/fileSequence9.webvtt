00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
to call out.

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:06.776 A:middle
So the result is that most of

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.866 A:middle
the notifications from Calendar

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:11.516 A:middle
that are information updates

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:14.186 A:middle
that are not something that I

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:15.406 A:middle
need to react to immediately.

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:17.506 A:middle
Or that I don't need to have in

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.936 A:middle
reference later.

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:20.126 A:middle
For example, to know where the

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:20.666 A:middle
event is.

00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:22.276 A:middle
They're grouped together in one

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:22.796 A:middle
group.

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:25.476 A:middle
And the other notifications that

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:26.626 A:middle
are the more important ones,

00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:28.316 A:middle
more urgent or the ones that I

00:09:28.316 --> 00:09:29.856 A:middle
need to reference maybe later to

00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:32.066 A:middle
find the meeting room, they're

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:36.866 A:middle
separate than this other one.

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:40.436 A:middle
So this is-- just expand and I

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:42.596 A:middle
see what else is in my group.

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:47.606 A:middle
And this is the pattern that we

00:09:47.606 --> 00:09:48.606 A:middle
learned from Calendar.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:51.066 A:middle
Separate important actional

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.796 A:middle
notification from informative

00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:53.346 A:middle
updates.

00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.256 A:middle
Our next example is Messages.
