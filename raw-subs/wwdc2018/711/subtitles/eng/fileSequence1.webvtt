00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
Then we'll look at the default

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.896 A:middle
grouping, app grouping.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.476 A:middle
We will see how to create custom

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:07.416 A:middle
groups for your notifications so

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.606 A:middle
that you can adapt the groups to

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:11.736 A:middle
the content of your apps.

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:13.896 A:middle
And finally, we will learn how

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.616 A:middle
to create custom summaries for

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.256 A:middle
your new notification groups.

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:22.636 A:middle
Let's start with a brief

00:01:22.636 --> 00:01:24.186 A:middle
overview of the UI of the

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:24.596 A:middle
feature.

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.346 A:middle
Notification groups collect sets

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:30.846 A:middle
of different notifications

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:32.326 A:middle
together and in a group, and

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.926 A:middle
group them in a small stack.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.276 A:middle
This helps making Notification

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.126 A:middle
Center better organized and more

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:39.966 A:middle
efficient for the user so that

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.886 A:middle
he can see more notifications at

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
the same time.

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:44.436 A:middle
Without any app taking over the

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.716 A:middle
entire screen and preventing

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:47.946 A:middle
them from seeing some of the

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:48.576 A:middle
content.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.666 A:middle
Each notification group shows

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.166 A:middle
the most recent notification

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.646 A:middle
that was delivered to that group

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:56.536 A:middle
at the top.

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:58.016 A:middle
And we call these the leading

00:01:58.106 --> 00:01:58.876 A:middle
notification.
