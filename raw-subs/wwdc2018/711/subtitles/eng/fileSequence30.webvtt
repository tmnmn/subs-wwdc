00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
you already displayed additional

00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:02.696 A:middle
notifications to the user by

00:30:03.216 --> 00:30:04.946 A:middle
loading them from the delivery

00:30:04.946 --> 00:30:05.826 A:middle
notifications.

00:30:06.186 --> 00:30:08.156 A:middle
Or by loading them from your own

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:10.366 A:middle
API, you should remove them from

00:30:10.366 --> 00:30:11.576 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:13.996 A:middle
To continue keeping Notification

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:16.736 A:middle
Center organized and more

00:30:16.736 --> 00:30:16.966 A:middle
efficient.

00:30:18.336 --> 00:30:20.696 A:middle
I want to recap a little what we

00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:21.356 A:middle
talked about.

00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:23.666 A:middle
It was a long presentation, and

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:25.156 A:middle
there were a lot of details.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.676 A:middle
But I only have two very

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:27.716 A:middle
important things that I want you

00:30:27.716 --> 00:30:28.506 A:middle
to remember here.

00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:31.266 A:middle
The first one is the goal of

00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.266 A:middle
notification grouping.

00:30:32.816 --> 00:30:33.866 A:middle
The goal of notification

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:36.166 A:middle
grouping is to better organize

00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.146 A:middle
Notification Center and help

00:30:38.146 --> 00:30:40.706 A:middle
your users be more efficient in

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:41.456 A:middle
when they're using your

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:42.186 A:middle
notifications.

00:30:42.576 --> 00:30:44.116 A:middle
This will help them triage them,

00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:46.026 A:middle
and will have them receiving

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:47.176 A:middle
important information more

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:49.336 A:middle
quickly and react better.

00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:55.066 A:middle
And the second thing I want you

00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:57.096 A:middle
to remember is to add custom

00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:58.526 A:middle
summaries to improve clarity.

00:30:59.336 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
As you see in my examples, for
