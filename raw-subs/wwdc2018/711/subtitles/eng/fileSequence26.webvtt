00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:01.286 A:middle
format that we just saw.

00:26:02.106 --> 00:26:04.416 A:middle
But of course we can also format

00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:07.106 A:middle
summaries with arguments.

00:26:08.216 --> 00:26:11.866 A:middle
You see we define the format

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:12.986 A:middle
string at the top.

00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:14.746 A:middle
We need to match the

00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:17.536 A:middle
configuration dictionary by key.

00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:20.396 A:middle
And underneath we specify the

00:26:20.396 --> 00:26:21.646 A:middle
two strings for the two

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:22.456 A:middle
different versions.

00:26:23.496 --> 00:26:25.586 A:middle
With the numerical placeholder

00:26:26.026 --> 00:26:28.216 A:middle
and the placeholder for the list

00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:29.526 A:middle
that we're going to provide with

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:29.786 A:middle
names.

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:39.146 A:middle
So since we're exchanging these

00:26:39.146 --> 00:26:41.896 A:middle
format strings between apps and

00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:42.806 A:middle
the system.

00:26:43.256 --> 00:26:44.646 A:middle
These are effectively part of

00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:44.996 A:middle
the API.

00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:47.826 A:middle
So there's only a limited number

00:26:47.946 --> 00:26:50.236 A:middle
of formats that we can support.

00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:52.936 A:middle
And we need to agree on those.

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.576 A:middle
And they are the ones that I

00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:55.436 A:middle
just showed you in these

00:26:55.436 --> 00:26:56.116 A:middle
examples.

00:26:56.866 --> 00:26:58.506 A:middle
The first format that you can

00:26:58.506 --> 00:26:59.996 A:middle
use is the one with one
