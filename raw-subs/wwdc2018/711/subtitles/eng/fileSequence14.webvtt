00:13:56.316 --> 00:14:00.016 A:middle
But then if a contact that is in

00:14:00.016 --> 00:14:02.296 A:middle
my VIP contact sends an email to

00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:03.016 A:middle
that account.

00:14:03.796 --> 00:14:06.286 A:middle
That email is separated out to a

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.536 A:middle
different group because I said

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:09.706 A:middle
that's a VIP person.

00:14:09.706 --> 00:14:11.016 A:middle
That's a contract that I want to

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.836 A:middle
be informed about immediately

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:16.616 A:middle
when it sends an email.

00:14:16.616 --> 00:14:18.226 A:middle
And if I turn on thread

00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:19.826 A:middle
notifications for some specific

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:22.256 A:middle
threads inside of Mail, also,

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:24.256 A:middle
those also get separated out in

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:24.976 A:middle
their own group.

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:32.166 A:middle
So you see that while Mail

00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:34.636 A:middle
shares some of the same

00:14:34.636 --> 00:14:37.356 A:middle
characteristics as Messages, the

00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:38.266 A:middle
approach of grouping

00:14:38.266 --> 00:14:39.416 A:middle
notification is a little

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:39.876 A:middle
different.

00:14:39.936 --> 00:14:41.656 A:middle
Because the use of the

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:43.336 A:middle
notification and of the app and

00:14:43.336 --> 00:14:45.266 A:middle
the content is different.

00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:49.036 A:middle
So what is Mail telling us here?

00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:51.726 A:middle
Respect the user's priorities

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:52.746 A:middle
and organization.

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:54.796 A:middle
Mail provides feature to

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:57.306 A:middle
organize email and to prioritize

00:14:57.306 --> 00:14:57.966 A:middle
the content.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
So we can use that to organize
