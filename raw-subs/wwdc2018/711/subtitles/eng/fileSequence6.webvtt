00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:00.726 A:middle
We introduced it to, for

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.386 A:middle
[inaudible] notifications and

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:03.876 A:middle
for private notifications.

00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:05.786 A:middle
So if you already adopted this

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:08.096 A:middle
API to support these two other

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:09.666 A:middle
features in previous iOS

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:10.176 A:middle
releases.

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:11.996 A:middle
Your notifications are already

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:14.566 A:middle
grouping today in iOS 12.

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:17.346 A:middle
You may want to review how the

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:18.796 A:middle
groups are created since now the

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:19.926 A:middle
context is a little bit

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:20.356 A:middle
different.

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.316 A:middle
So it may be useful to adjust

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.526 A:middle
them a little bit.

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:28.136 A:middle
So in this example, you see how

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:29.456 A:middle
to create a thread, set a thread

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:30.616 A:middle
identifier on a local

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:31.356 A:middle
notification.

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:34.196 A:middle
And of course you can set it on

00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:35.726 A:middle
a push payload for push

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:36.536 A:middle
notifications.

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.726 A:middle
Okay. No, now let's go over a

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:46.996 A:middle
few examples from iOS 12.

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:49.816 A:middle
The most important thing to keep

00:06:49.816 --> 00:06:51.326 A:middle
in mind as we go through these

00:06:51.326 --> 00:06:53.276 A:middle
examples is the goal on

00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:54.266 A:middle
notification grouping.

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.226 A:middle
When grouping-- by grouping

00:06:56.226 --> 00:06:59.276 A:middle
notifications we want to make

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.186 A:middle
notifications more efficient for
