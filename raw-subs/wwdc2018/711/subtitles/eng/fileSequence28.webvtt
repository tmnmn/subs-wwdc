00:27:58.186 --> 00:28:00.816 A:middle
And the thread group are defined

00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:02.136 A:middle
in the notification content.

00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:04.526 A:middle
That means that you can mix in

00:28:04.526 --> 00:28:06.826 A:middle
the same group notifications

00:28:06.826 --> 00:28:08.196 A:middle
that have different summaries.

00:28:08.696 --> 00:28:09.986 A:middle
And what happens when you do

00:28:09.986 --> 00:28:10.216 A:middle
that?

00:28:11.276 --> 00:28:12.946 A:middle
So there's two main cases.

00:28:13.756 --> 00:28:16.206 A:middle
If none of the summaries in that

00:28:16.206 --> 00:28:18.756 A:middle
group have any arguments, we'll

00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:21.166 A:middle
try to combine all the summaries

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.726 A:middle
in the list and display them

00:28:22.726 --> 00:28:24.246 A:middle
like this.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:28.196 A:middle
But if any of the notification

00:28:28.196 --> 00:28:31.116 A:middle
summaries in that group have any

00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:32.966 A:middle
arguments, we're going to have

00:28:32.966 --> 00:28:34.246 A:middle
to fall back to the default

00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:34.776 A:middle
message.

00:28:40.276 --> 00:28:43.486 A:middle
The second tip is about enriched

00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:45.026 A:middle
notifications and groups.

00:28:46.436 --> 00:28:47.836 A:middle
So we introduced enriched

00:28:47.836 --> 00:28:49.836 A:middle
notifications a while ago in

00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:50.516 A:middle
iOS.

00:28:51.006 --> 00:28:52.976 A:middle
And they continued working in

00:28:53.116 --> 00:28:54.406 A:middle
with group notifications.

00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:58.166 A:middle
And when the user presses on a

00:28:58.166 --> 00:28:59.576 A:middle
group to see the enriched

00:28:59.576 --> 00:29:01.566 A:middle
notification that loads your
