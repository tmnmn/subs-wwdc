00:20:58.656 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
And what happens when I expand

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:01.126 A:middle
this group?

00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:04.906 A:middle
What happens is that there are

00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:05.976 A:middle
only three external

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:07.366 A:middle
notifications in the group.

00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:10.106 A:middle
Not seven like the summary said.

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:11.796 A:middle
And in previous examples, the

00:21:11.796 --> 00:21:13.816 A:middle
number in the summary matched

00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:15.886 A:middle
the number of notifications that

00:21:15.886 --> 00:21:18.206 A:middle
were contained in the group.

00:21:18.396 --> 00:21:19.556 A:middle
So what is happening here?

00:21:20.936 --> 00:21:23.386 A:middle
Well, since Podcasts does these

00:21:23.386 --> 00:21:25.176 A:middle
bundling on notification and

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:26.886 A:middle
they try to limit the number of

00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:28.196 A:middle
notifications they send.

00:21:28.716 --> 00:21:30.706 A:middle
When a show releases multiple

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.106 A:middle
episodes at the same time.

00:21:32.576 --> 00:21:33.716 A:middle
They have these notifications

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:35.566 A:middle
that say, "Two new episodes are

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:36.796 A:middle
available, three new episodes

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.246 A:middle
are available."

00:21:38.286 --> 00:21:41.426 A:middle
And if you sum the number, the

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.866 A:middle
number of episodes in the bottom

00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:44.146 A:middle
three notifications, there were

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:45.696 A:middle
the ones that accounted for the

00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:47.006 A:middle
summary, you can see that the

00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:47.846 A:middle
total is seven.

00:21:48.966 --> 00:21:51.106 A:middle
So let's see how the API for

00:21:51.106 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
this works.

00:21:52.376 --> 00:21:55.146 A:middle
It's just another property on

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:56.796 A:middle
the notification content and

00:21:56.796 --> 00:21:58.246 A:middle
it's called summary argument

00:21:58.296 --> 00:21:58.656 A:middle
count.
