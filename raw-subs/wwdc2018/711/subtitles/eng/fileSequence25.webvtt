00:24:59.716 --> 00:25:01.906 A:middle
So after you set a localized

00:25:01.906 --> 00:25:03.426 A:middle
string here, you need to

00:25:03.426 --> 00:25:04.416 A:middle
localize the string.

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:08.976 A:middle
And you localize the string in a

00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:10.766 A:middle
strings dict file.

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:12.996 A:middle
A strings dict file is a

00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:14.646 A:middle
property list file that

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:18.036 A:middle
describes a performance string

00:25:18.236 --> 00:25:20.186 A:middle
and a configuration dictionary.

00:25:20.526 --> 00:25:21.956 A:middle
In the configuration dictionary

00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:23.526 A:middle
here at the bottom, you see the

00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:26.646 A:middle
two versions of the string for

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:28.586 A:middle
singular and plural in English.

00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:31.396 A:middle
But as I said, all you need to

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:33.046 A:middle
do to support other languages

00:25:33.046 --> 00:25:34.256 A:middle
and different pluralization

00:25:34.256 --> 00:25:37.296 A:middle
rules is change this stings dict

00:25:37.296 --> 00:25:37.666 A:middle
file.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:38.796 A:middle
You create a new one.

00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
And you see here Hebrew has

00:25:40.826 --> 00:25:42.356 A:middle
three different cases for

00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:44.096 A:middle
plurals.

00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
And Russian has three different

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:48.616 A:middle
ones and they're different from

00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:48.996 A:middle
Hebrew.

00:25:49.216 --> 00:25:51.336 A:middle
And you don't need to know which

00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:52.266 A:middle
one to use when.

00:25:52.716 --> 00:25:53.886 A:middle
If you use the foundation API

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:54.656 A:middle
that we provide.

00:25:56.776 --> 00:25:59.666 A:middle
This is for the simple summary
