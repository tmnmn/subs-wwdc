00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:01.856 A:middle
And this count expresses the

00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:03.986 A:middle
number of items that summary

00:22:03.986 --> 00:22:05.666 A:middle
argument account, accounts for.

00:22:05.986 --> 00:22:06.706 A:middle
In the summary.

00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:10.516 A:middle
We will collect again as before

00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:11.236 A:middle
all the names.

00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:13.786 A:middle
We will sum up all the counts.

00:22:14.006 --> 00:22:16.036 A:middle
And we will create the summary.

00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:19.466 A:middle
And again as we can see, these

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.556 A:middle
notification would have summary

00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:23.386 A:middle
argument count three, one,

00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:25.056 A:middle
three, total is seven.

00:22:25.776 --> 00:22:27.516 A:middle
And that's the summary that we

00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:27.946 A:middle
displayed.

00:22:28.386 --> 00:22:31.916 A:middle
And as everything else, of

00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:33.356 A:middle
course you can also set it in

00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:34.136 A:middle
the push payload.

00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:39.636 A:middle
The summary argument count is

00:22:39.636 --> 00:22:40.096 A:middle
optional.

00:22:40.646 --> 00:22:42.776 A:middle
Defaults to one so you can only

00:22:42.776 --> 00:22:44.866 A:middle
need to set it if you're doing

00:22:44.866 --> 00:22:45.996 A:middle
this type of bundling on

00:22:45.996 --> 00:22:46.686 A:middle
notifications.

00:22:46.686 --> 00:22:47.706 A:middle
You don't need to set it always.

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:57.236 A:middle
Now, we are playing with words

00:22:57.506 --> 00:22:59.346 A:middle
and we are building sentences.

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:01.936 A:middle
And when you do that, you always
