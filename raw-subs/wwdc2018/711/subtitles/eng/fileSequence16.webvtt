00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
more notifications from National

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:01.746 A:middle
Geographic.

00:16:05.186 --> 00:16:07.356 A:middle
Let's explore this one a little

00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:07.616 A:middle
bit.

00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:10.426 A:middle
If your nine notifications said

00:16:10.426 --> 00:16:12.096 A:middle
default message that we set in

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.796 A:middle
groups if you don't customize

00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:14.326 A:middle
your summary.

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:18.856 A:middle
But you can better describe your

00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
content.

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:20.916 A:middle
For example, if you have an app

00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:22.176 A:middle
that sends messages.

00:16:22.966 --> 00:16:24.856 A:middle
You may want to see, you may

00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:26.056 A:middle
want to say there that you're

00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:27.306 A:middle
sending nine more messages.

00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:30.006 A:middle
So how you do that?

00:16:30.776 --> 00:16:32.206 A:middle
The first thing you have to do

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:34.186 A:middle
is to pick a summary format.

00:16:34.446 --> 00:16:36.316 A:middle
And this is a format string that

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:37.906 A:middle
just describes your content with

00:16:37.906 --> 00:16:39.356 A:middle
a numerical placeholder.

00:16:39.636 --> 00:16:41.926 A:middle
As we see here, number, more

00:16:41.926 --> 00:16:42.646 A:middle
messages.

00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:45.876 A:middle
And then you set this format

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:47.566 A:middle
string in the notification

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:49.776 A:middle
category that you're going to

00:16:49.776 --> 00:16:50.926 A:middle
use to send a notification.

00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:55.586 A:middle
If you notice, the summary

00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:57.386 A:middle
format is set on the category.

00:16:57.806 --> 00:16:59.356 A:middle
Whereas the thread was set on

00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.546 A:middle
the notification content.
