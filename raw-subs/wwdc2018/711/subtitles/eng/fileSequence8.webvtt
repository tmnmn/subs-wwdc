00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
Or time to leave notifications.

00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:02.346 A:middle
These are more important because

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:04.546 A:middle
are notifications that I need to

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:05.546 A:middle
act on right now.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.116 A:middle
If I receive a notification that

00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:08.736 A:middle
I have a meeting in 15 minutes,

00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:10.536 A:middle
I need to start walking, because

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:11.446 A:middle
I have to go to the meeting.

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:13.896 A:middle
But many of the other

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.436 A:middle
notifications are not something

00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:18.006 A:middle
that need to be responded to

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:18.526 A:middle
immediately.

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:20.986 A:middle
There may be updates to share

00:08:20.986 --> 00:08:21.696 A:middle
Calendars.

00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:23.986 A:middle
There may be time changes in

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:25.576 A:middle
other events that are later in

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.096 A:middle
the day or some other day.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.956 A:middle
And so it's useful to separate

00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:30.246 A:middle
them.

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.466 A:middle
So what Calendar is doing is

00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:35.996 A:middle
using the default group, the app

00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:38.566 A:middle
group, for the bulk of the

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:39.716 A:middle
notification that it sends.

00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:41.905 A:middle
And it does that by not setting

00:08:41.905 --> 00:08:43.686 A:middle
any thread identifier on a

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.396 A:middle
majority of its notifications.

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:47.556 A:middle
Mail is a default value.

00:08:47.696 --> 00:08:49.486 A:middle
So if you don't set it, that's a

00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:51.426 A:middle
default group.

00:08:51.576 --> 00:08:54.076 A:middle
And then Calendar sets a

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:56.026 A:middle
specific thread identifier just

00:08:56.026 --> 00:08:57.936 A:middle
for these notifications that are

00:08:57.936 --> 00:08:59.396 A:middle
more important and that it wants

00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
to call out.
