00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.546 A:middle
the notification content.

00:17:01.076 --> 00:17:02.796 A:middle
This is because categories as

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:06.266 A:middle
you know are types, groups, of

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:08.626 A:middle
notifications that you send that

00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:09.326 A:middle
are similar.

00:17:09.955 --> 00:17:11.596 A:middle
For example, messages has

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:12.935 A:middle
different categories for

00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:14.945 A:middle
one-to-one conversations.

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:16.675 A:middle
And group conversations.

00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:18.266 A:middle
And this means that they can set

00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:19.806 A:middle
different summaries for those

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:20.616 A:middle
two categories.

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:22.326 A:middle
That is why the summary format

00:17:22.326 --> 00:17:23.766 A:middle
is set in the category here.

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:29.546 A:middle
And while you're here updating

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.166 A:middle
your notification category for

00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:33.306 A:middle
notification groups, you can

00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:35.536 A:middle
also set this hidden previous

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:38.216 A:middle
placeholder property which is

00:17:38.216 --> 00:17:40.346 A:middle
very similar to the summary that

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:41.816 A:middle
we used for notification groups.

00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:43.936 A:middle
The major difference between

00:17:43.936 --> 00:17:45.916 A:middle
these two is the context in

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:46.656 A:middle
which they're used.

00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:48.906 A:middle
The hidden previous placeholder

00:17:48.906 --> 00:17:49.866 A:middle
is not a new feature.

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:50.726 A:middle
It's a feature that we

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:52.906 A:middle
introduced last year in iOS 11.

00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:56.486 A:middle
And this customizes the text

00:17:56.816 --> 00:17:58.736 A:middle
that is displayed instead of the

00:17:58.736 --> 00:18:00.566 A:middle
notification when the user sets
