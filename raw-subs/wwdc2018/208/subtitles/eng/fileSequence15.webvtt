00:15:00.146 --> 00:15:01.656 A:middle
UIView provides itself as a

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:02.546 A:middle
coordinateSpace.

00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:04.256 A:middle
If your container is more

00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:05.626 A:middle
abstract, you may return an

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:07.676 A:middle
existing coordinateSpace or

00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:08.516 A:middle
implement your own.

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:11.466 A:middle
Next, you will need to implement

00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:12.626 A:middle
focusItems in rect.

00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:14.686 A:middle
This method must return any

00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:16.496 A:middle
contained focusItems whose

00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:17.806 A:middle
frames intersect with the

00:15:17.806 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
provided rect.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.626 A:middle
Note that the rect passed to

00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:22.276 A:middle
this method is expressed in the

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:23.306 A:middle
coordinateSpace of the

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:25.756 A:middle
container, and the frames of

00:15:25.756 --> 00:15:27.506 A:middle
each focusItem you return from

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:29.166 A:middle
this method must also be

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:30.006 A:middle
expressed in that

00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:30.976 A:middle
coordinateSpace.

00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:35.126 A:middle
Next, let's implement a custom

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:35.806 A:middle
FocusItem.

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.246 A:middle
Remember that this protocol

00:15:38.246 --> 00:15:39.826 A:middle
inherits from FocusEnvironment,

00:15:39.826 --> 00:15:40.986 A:middle
so you will need to implement

00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:42.296 A:middle
all of those methods as well.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.196 A:middle
In order for the focus engine to

00:15:45.196 --> 00:15:47.216 A:middle
move focus onto your item, it

00:15:47.216 --> 00:15:48.586 A:middle
must return "true" from

00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:49.726 A:middle
canBecomeFocused.

00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:52.896 A:middle
DidHintFocusMovement is an

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:54.606 A:middle
optional method that is called

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:55.966 A:middle
whenever the user moves their

00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:57.606 A:middle
finger on the touch surface of

00:15:57.606 --> 00:15:58.406 A:middle
the Siri remote.

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
It provides the focusItem with a
