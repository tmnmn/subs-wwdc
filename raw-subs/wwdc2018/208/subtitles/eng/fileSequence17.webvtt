00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
interaction hinting.

00:17:01.046 --> 00:17:02.496 A:middle
And, interactionTransform

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:04.116 A:middle
combines all three of these

00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:05.715 A:middle
values into a single 3D

00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:06.326 A:middle
transform.

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:09.945 A:middle
Next, let's look at how to

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:11.006 A:middle
implement a custom

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:12.965 A:middle
focusItemScrollableContainer.

00:17:13.726 --> 00:17:15.286 A:middle
This is a special type of

00:17:15.286 --> 00:17:17.086 A:middle
focusItemContainer, and by

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:18.606 A:middle
conforming to this protocol,

00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
your container signals to the

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:22.016 A:middle
focus engine that it supports

00:17:22.016 --> 00:17:22.486 A:middle
scrolling.

00:17:22.806 --> 00:17:24.626 A:middle
For example, UIScrollView

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.006 A:middle
conforms to this protocol.

00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:28.856 A:middle
It provides three additional

00:17:28.856 --> 00:17:30.786 A:middle
properties that allows the focus

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.446 A:middle
engine to manage its scrolling

00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:32.986 A:middle
behavior.

00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:36.146 A:middle
First, we have contentOffset,

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.376 A:middle
which is a read/write property

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:39.746 A:middle
representing how far the

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:41.106 A:middle
container has been scrolled.

00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:43.406 A:middle
This property will automatically

00:17:43.406 --> 00:17:45.506 A:middle
be set by the focus engine as

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:47.916 A:middle
focus is moved in order to keep

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.416 A:middle
the currently focused item on

00:17:49.416 --> 00:17:49.916 A:middle
screen.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.076 A:middle
Second, we have contentSize,

00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:56.686 A:middle
which represents the total size

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:58.626 A:middle
of your scrollable content and

00:17:58.726 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
third, we have visibleSize,
