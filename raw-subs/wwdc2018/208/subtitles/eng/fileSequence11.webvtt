[ Applause ]

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:04.966 A:middle
This means that apps written in

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:07.036 A:middle
frameworks such as Metal can now

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:09.056 A:middle
adopt focus directly into their

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:09.996 A:middle
interaction model.

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:12.006 A:middle
This is accomplished by allowing

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:13.596 A:middle
you to conform your own classes

00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:15.666 A:middle
to focus protocols, even if they

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:17.196 A:middle
don't inherit from UIKit

00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:17.976 A:middle
components.

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:20.386 A:middle
Now, what this means for your

00:11:20.386 --> 00:11:22.726 A:middle
apps is they will get state

00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:24.266 A:middle
management of what's currently

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:24.876 A:middle
focused.

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.246 A:middle
Geometric determination of where

00:11:27.246 --> 00:11:28.806 A:middle
focus can and cannot move.

00:11:29.366 --> 00:11:32.136 A:middle
Full accessibility support, and

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:34.316 A:middle
focus movement, hinting, and

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:36.216 A:middle
scrolling that feels just like

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:37.686 A:middle
native tvOS apps.

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:40.556 A:middle
Before we take a look at the new

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.626 A:middle
focus API's, let's briefly

00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:43.816 A:middle
refresh ourselves on some

00:11:43.816 --> 00:11:45.266 A:middle
existing focus components.

00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:47.226 A:middle
First, we have

00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:48.536 A:middle
UIFocusEnvironments.

00:11:48.866 --> 00:11:50.626 A:middle
This protocol manages state

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.026 A:middle
where focus interactions can

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:52.666 A:middle
take place.

00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:54.316 A:middle
It is notified when focus

00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:56.296 A:middle
updates occur, and can influence

00:11:56.296 --> 00:11:57.506 A:middle
focus update behavior.

00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.206 A:middle
In UIKit, UIViewController is a
