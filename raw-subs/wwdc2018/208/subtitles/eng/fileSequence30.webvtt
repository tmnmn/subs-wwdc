00:30:02.256 --> 00:30:04.716 A:middle
Next, is monogram.

00:30:06.816 --> 00:30:08.656 A:middle
MonogramView is for representing

00:30:08.656 --> 00:30:09.006 A:middle
people.

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:13.716 A:middle
And, TVMonogramView has a

00:30:13.716 --> 00:30:15.876 A:middle
circular content image, and a

00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:17.836 A:middle
footer, which itself is composed

00:30:17.836 --> 00:30:18.746 A:middle
of up to two labels.

00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:22.496 A:middle
When you don't provide either a

00:30:22.496 --> 00:30:23.786 A:middle
person name, or an image,

00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:26.266 A:middle
TVMonogramView provides a

00:30:26.266 --> 00:30:27.156 A:middle
generic silhouette.

00:30:27.696 --> 00:30:30.606 A:middle
If you do provide a person name,

00:30:31.386 --> 00:30:33.146 A:middle
TVMonogramView will create a

00:30:33.146 --> 00:30:34.306 A:middle
monogram from the initials.

00:30:34.906 --> 00:30:38.656 A:middle
And, of course, when you provide

00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:40.446 A:middle
an image, it doesn't question

00:30:40.446 --> 00:30:41.576 A:middle
it, we'll just use it.

00:30:44.096 --> 00:30:46.266 A:middle
When TVMonogramView is in focus,

00:30:47.396 --> 00:30:48.686 A:middle
the labels move out of the way

00:30:49.116 --> 00:30:50.526 A:middle
for the image to grow in size.

00:30:53.106 --> 00:30:54.926 A:middle
When you use a TVMonogramView,

00:30:56.006 --> 00:30:57.666 A:middle
creating a UI like this becomes

00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:58.746 A:middle
really straightforward.

00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:01.396 A:middle
