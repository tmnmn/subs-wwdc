00:20:01.506 --> 00:20:02.696 A:middle
The first thing I'm going to do

00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:04.566 A:middle
is extend my LevelTile class to

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:06.046 A:middle
implement the UIFocusItem.

00:20:06.316 --> 00:20:07.826 A:middle
This is what will allow it to

00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:08.536 A:middle
become focused.

00:20:09.726 --> 00:20:10.866 A:middle
There's a few methods here.

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:11.956 A:middle
I'm just going to direct your

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.126 A:middle
attention to a few at the top.

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:15.556 A:middle
It canBecomeFocused, I'm going

00:20:15.556 --> 00:20:16.396 A:middle
to enter in "true."

00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:17.616 A:middle
That's straightforward.

00:20:18.616 --> 00:20:20.116 A:middle
For parentFocusEnvironment, I'm

00:20:20.216 --> 00:20:21.536 A:middle
going to return the MetalView

00:20:21.536 --> 00:20:22.576 A:middle
that renders these items.

00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:25.156 A:middle
Finally in didUpdateFocus in

00:20:25.206 --> 00:20:26.676 A:middle
context, I'm going to set the

00:20:26.676 --> 00:20:28.516 A:middle
tile to draw itself in an active

00:20:28.516 --> 00:20:30.286 A:middle
state when it becomes focused.

00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:33.356 A:middle
Next, I need to tell the focus

00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:34.666 A:middle
engine about these new items.

00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:37.076 A:middle
To do that, I'm going to extend

00:20:37.076 --> 00:20:39.176 A:middle
that MetalView that renders

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:39.356 A:middle
them.

00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:41.636 A:middle
The view is already in the view

00:20:41.636 --> 00:20:43.026 A:middle
hierarchy, and the focus engine

00:20:43.026 --> 00:20:43.956 A:middle
already knows about it.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:45.216 A:middle
So, it's a great place to hook

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:45.496 A:middle
in.

00:20:46.436 --> 00:20:47.906 A:middle
And, because this is a UIView,

00:20:48.186 --> 00:20:49.196 A:middle
it already conforms to

00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:50.526 A:middle
UIFocusItemContainer.

00:20:50.906 --> 00:20:52.686 A:middle
And, it provides itself as a

00:20:52.686 --> 00:20:53.526 A:middle
coordinatespace.

00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:55.776 A:middle
The only thing I have to do is

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:58.296 A:middle
override FocusItem in rect to

00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:00.066 A:middle
return my level tiles, which of
