00:34:59.756 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
the prompt text, let the user

00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:02.296 A:middle
know that it was an invalid

00:35:02.296 --> 00:35:03.296 A:middle
passcode, and we're going to

00:35:03.296 --> 00:35:05.076 A:middle
call the clearEntry animated

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:05.486 A:middle
true.

00:35:05.866 --> 00:35:08.086 A:middle
What this will do is clear out

00:35:08.086 --> 00:35:09.576 A:middle
all the digits, and shake the

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:10.736 A:middle
digit view to let the user know

00:35:10.736 --> 00:35:11.586 A:middle
that something went wrong.

00:35:11.946 --> 00:35:13.296 A:middle
And then, finally, we're going

00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:14.396 A:middle
to present the viewController.

00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:15.606 A:middle
And, since this is just a

00:35:15.606 --> 00:35:16.806 A:middle
viewController, we can use

00:35:16.806 --> 00:35:18.916 A:middle
custom presentation styles.

00:35:19.296 --> 00:35:20.306 A:middle
So here we're going to use the

00:35:20.306 --> 00:35:22.396 A:middle
blurOverFullScreen, which was

00:35:22.396 --> 00:35:23.986 A:middle
introduced in tvOS last year.

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:26.576 A:middle
Let's run this and see how it

00:35:26.576 --> 00:35:26.846 A:middle
works.

00:35:26.846 --> 00:35:29.556 A:middle
So, I'm going to select my

00:35:29.556 --> 00:35:29.916 A:middle
movie.

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:31.506 A:middle
And, we see we get the

00:35:31.506 --> 00:35:33.096 A:middle
blurOverFullScreen animation,

00:35:33.096 --> 00:35:34.466 A:middle
and we get prompted to enter our

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:35.046 A:middle
passcode.

00:35:35.436 --> 00:35:36.786 A:middle
Now, we know that it's all 1's

00:35:36.816 --> 00:35:38.136 A:middle
right now, so let's see what

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.566 A:middle
happens if I enter all 2's.

00:35:39.566 --> 00:35:41.576 A:middle
We see that we get a nice shake

00:35:41.576 --> 00:35:42.886 A:middle
animation, and we update the

00:35:42.886 --> 00:35:43.346 A:middle
text.

00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:45.926 A:middle
Now, we go enter all 1's.

00:35:47.006 --> 00:35:47.916 A:middle
We know that's the correct

00:35:47.916 --> 00:35:49.166 A:middle
passcode, so we dismiss the

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.236 A:middle
viewController and we can play

00:35:50.236 --> 00:35:50.766 A:middle
our content.

00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:54.736 A:middle
Now, if the user wants to use--

00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:56.476 A:middle
they most likely want to use

00:35:56.476 --> 00:35:57.626 A:middle
their own passcode, so what

00:35:57.626 --> 00:35:58.506 A:middle
we're going to do is we're going

00:35:58.506 --> 00:35:59.566 A:middle
to take this settings button

00:35:59.566 --> 00:36:00.846 A:middle
here, and we're going to allow
