We cannot wait for you and your

00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:01.966 A:middle
users to get your hands on it.

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:03.676 A:middle
Next, I'd like to invite up Ada

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:04.306 A:middle
to talk about focus

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:04.906 A:middle
enhancements.

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Alex.

00:10:14.716 --> 00:10:16.486 A:middle
Hi, my name is Ada Turner, and

00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:17.816 A:middle
I'm really excited to talk to

00:10:17.816 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
you today about some

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:19.956 A:middle
enhancements that we've made to

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:21.716 A:middle
Focus in tvOS 12.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.036 A:middle
Focus is a great way for users

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:27.276 A:middle
to interact with your apps on

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:27.656 A:middle
tvOS.

00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:29.046 A:middle
It allows them to gracefully

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:30.746 A:middle
scroll through content and

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:31.966 A:middle
provides playful movement

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.516 A:middle
hinting as they interact with

00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:34.836 A:middle
the touch surface of the Siri

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:35.296 A:middle
remote.

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:37.616 A:middle
Apps built with UIKit,

00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:40.166 A:middle
SpriteKit, and SceneKit, all

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:41.806 A:middle
have native support for focus.

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:43.616 A:middle
However, apps that use

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:45.246 A:middle
alternative methods to render

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.076 A:middle
their content have not been able

00:10:47.076 --> 00:10:48.706 A:middle
to directly support the focus

00:10:48.706 --> 00:10:49.086 A:middle
engine.

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:51.856 A:middle
Today, I am pleased to announce

00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:54.046 A:middle
that in tvOS 12, the focus

00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:55.436 A:middle
engine, now supports apps

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:56.786 A:middle
regardless of how they are

00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:56.976 A:middle
rendered.
