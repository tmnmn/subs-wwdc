00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:01.396 A:middle
Now, you might have noticed that

00:31:01.396 --> 00:31:02.946 A:middle
there's a consistent pattern

00:31:03.206 --> 00:31:04.376 A:middle
among these four elements.

00:31:05.696 --> 00:31:08.056 A:middle
Namely, there's a main content,

00:31:09.146 --> 00:31:10.496 A:middle
and an optional header and

00:31:10.546 --> 00:31:10.816 A:middle
footer.

00:31:11.806 --> 00:31:13.116 A:middle
And, when this composition comes

00:31:13.116 --> 00:31:14.916 A:middle
in focus, the header and footer

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.726 A:middle
move out of the way, and the

00:31:16.726 --> 00:31:18.886 A:middle
content to grow in size.

00:31:19.876 --> 00:31:21.766 A:middle
This common behavior is

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:23.606 A:middle
encapsulated in a base class,

00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:25.066 A:middle
TVLockupView.

00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:28.206 A:middle
Some of the things you can

00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:31.066 A:middle
customize in a TVLockupView are

00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:33.496 A:middle
the explicit content size.

00:31:34.576 --> 00:31:35.696 A:middle
This is really helpful when

00:31:35.696 --> 00:31:36.696 A:middle
you're laying out multiple

00:31:36.696 --> 00:31:37.546 A:middle
LockupViews.

00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:41.856 A:middle
Another one is the content-- the

00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:43.406 A:middle
size by which the content grows

00:31:43.406 --> 00:31:44.176 A:middle
when it's in focus.

00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:47.066 A:middle
These are directional insets, so

00:31:47.626 --> 00:31:49.426 A:middle
you can even specify different

00:31:49.426 --> 00:31:50.776 A:middle
amount in all four directions.

00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:53.496 A:middle
You may recall that the

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:54.456 A:middle
CaptionButtonView is actually

00:31:54.456 --> 00:31:54.916 A:middle
using this.

00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
When you're providing your own
