00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:00.446 A:middle
TVUIKit.

00:38:02.696 --> 00:38:05.176 A:middle
In addition, TVUIKit also has

00:38:05.226 --> 00:38:06.056 A:middle
built-in support for

00:38:06.056 --> 00:38:07.326 A:middle
localization, including

00:38:07.326 --> 00:38:08.506 A:middle
right-to-left language support,

00:38:09.216 --> 00:38:10.546 A:middle
and of course, accessibility.

00:38:11.566 --> 00:38:12.976 A:middle
TVUIKit is available in the

00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:14.206 A:middle
Developer Beta, so please

00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:15.066 A:middle
download and check out the

00:38:15.066 --> 00:38:15.396 A:middle
headers.

00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:17.486 A:middle
And, as you use it in your app,

00:38:18.556 --> 00:38:19.736 A:middle
we think it will really save you

00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:21.066 A:middle
time and resources so you can

00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:22.856 A:middle
instead, focus on what makes

00:38:22.856 --> 00:38:23.816 A:middle
your app truly shine.

00:38:25.276 --> 00:38:27.006 A:middle
So, that's TVUIKit.

00:38:28.716 --> 00:38:30.816 A:middle
This afternoon we've just looked

00:38:30.816 --> 00:38:32.996 A:middle
at a few areas where tvOS 12 can

00:38:32.996 --> 00:38:34.246 A:middle
improve your app's user

00:38:34.246 --> 00:38:35.726 A:middle
experience and performance.

00:38:37.466 --> 00:38:38.676 A:middle
We learned about Password

00:38:38.676 --> 00:38:40.326 A:middle
AutoFill, which makes it really

00:38:40.326 --> 00:38:42.316 A:middle
easy for your customers to sign

00:38:42.316 --> 00:38:42.886 A:middle
in to your app.

00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:45.216 A:middle
And, it's especially more

00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:46.906 A:middle
helpful if they have strong

00:38:46.906 --> 00:38:47.356 A:middle
password.

00:38:47.936 --> 00:38:51.426 A:middle
We've also saw how we expanded

00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:53.726 A:middle
tvOS's focus engine to support

00:38:53.806 --> 00:38:55.996 A:middle
all apps, regardless of how they

00:38:55.996 --> 00:38:56.526 A:middle
are rendered.

00:38:57.516 --> 00:38:58.806 A:middle
This is truly game-changing.
