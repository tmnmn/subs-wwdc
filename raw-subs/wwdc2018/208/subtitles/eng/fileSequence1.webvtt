00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:03.626 A:middle
your customers sign into your

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:03.806 A:middle
app.

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:10.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:11.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Hans.

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:13.386 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.256 A:middle
My name is Alex Sanciangco.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:17.016 A:middle
And, today I am so excited to

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:18.556 A:middle
talk to you all about Password

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:19.056 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.076 A:middle
Signing in is a common

00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:23.236 A:middle
experience that users have with

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:23.636 A:middle
apps.

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:25.276 A:middle
For instance, here's an app I've

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:26.676 A:middle
been working on called "shiny,"

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:28.756 A:middle
that shows our users an adorable

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.026 A:middle
photo of their favorite dogs

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:31.116 A:middle
every day when they log in.

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:33.826 A:middle
In order to make logging in as

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:35.046 A:middle
smooth as possible, we've

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:37.006 A:middle

With an experience just as

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.896 A:middle
