00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:02.596 A:middle
Second, we learned how to use

00:24:02.736 --> 00:24:04.966 A:middle
focusItemContainer, so that when

00:24:04.966 --> 00:24:06.336 A:middle
users move focus through our

00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:08.126 A:middle
apps, it feels just like native

00:24:08.126 --> 00:24:09.196 A:middle
tvOS apps.

00:24:09.926 --> 00:24:11.566 A:middle
Third, we learned how to use

00:24:11.606 --> 00:24:13.286 A:middle
focusMovementHint to make our

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:15.056 A:middle
interface come alive as people

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:16.836 A:middle
interact with the Siri remote.

00:24:17.736 --> 00:24:19.636 A:middle
Fourth, we learned how to use

00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:21.676 A:middle
focusItemScrollableContainer to

00:24:21.676 --> 00:24:23.276 A:middle
allow people to scroll through

00:24:23.276 --> 00:24:24.466 A:middle
our apps content with that

00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:25.906 A:middle
smooth, familiar, native

00:24:25.906 --> 00:24:26.446 A:middle
feeling.

00:24:26.996 --> 00:24:28.786 A:middle
And, finally, we learned how to

00:24:28.786 --> 00:24:31.856 A:middle
give our apps full accessibility

00:24:31.856 --> 00:24:34.156 A:middle
support simply by adopting these

00:24:34.156 --> 00:24:36.026 A:middle
protocols, and providing

00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:37.576 A:middle
accessibility labels and hints

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:39.606 A:middle
so that everyone can enjoy our

00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:40.196 A:middle
apps.

00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:42.186 A:middle
All of these awesome new

00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:43.726 A:middle
features are available today in

00:24:43.726 --> 00:24:45.496 A:middle
the Developer Beta, and I highly

00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:46.706 A:middle
recommend that you download it,

00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.936 A:middle
and find out just how easy it is

00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.326 A:middle
to add focus support to your

00:24:50.326 --> 00:24:52.356 A:middle
custom rendered apps.

00:24:52.356 --> 00:24:54.466 A:middle
And now, I'd like to invite Hans

00:24:54.466 --> 00:24:55.856 A:middle
back on the stage, to tell us

00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:57.466 A:middle
about some awesome UI patterns

00:24:57.466 --> 00:24:57.976 A:middle
on tvOS.

00:24:58.516 --> 00:25:00.766 A:middle
