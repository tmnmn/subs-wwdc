00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:00.446 A:middle
that the QuickType bar appears

00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:01.286 A:middle
for your text fields.

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:03.976 A:middle
Next, you want to make sure that

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:05.366 A:middle
your app's credentials are

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:06.746 A:middle
suggested on the QuickType bar.

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:10.326 A:middle
And lastly, you want to enable a

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:12.126 A:middle
one-tap sign in experience.

00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:13.886 A:middle
Now, let's look at how to do

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
this in more detail.

00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:17.666 A:middle
To ensure the QuickType bar

00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:19.186 A:middle
appears for your text fields,

00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:20.466 A:middle
you want to adopt

00:06:20.616 --> 00:06:22.156 A:middle
UITextContentTypes.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.906 A:middle
tvOS will automatically try to

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:26.256 A:middle
detect username and password

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:27.746 A:middle
fields, and you can help this

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:29.646 A:middle
process by explicitly marking

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:30.416 A:middle
your text fields.

00:06:31.386 --> 00:06:32.556 A:middle
This is as easy as setting a

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:33.836 A:middle
single property on those text

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:34.116 A:middle
fields.

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:36.576 A:middle
Simply set, for your username

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:37.556 A:middle
text fields, it's

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:39.556 A:middle
textContentType to .username,

00:06:39.926 --> 00:06:41.316 A:middle
and similarly for your password

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:42.296 A:middle
field, you'll set its

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:43.986 A:middle
textContentType to .password.

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:45.836 A:middle
Very simple, and this can be

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:46.976 A:middle
done in Interface Builder as

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:47.216 A:middle
well.

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.876 A:middle
So, after adopting the

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.536 A:middle
textContentTypes, here's what

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.756 A:middle
viewers would likely see in that

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:53.606 A:middle
continuity keyboard

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:54.266 A:middle
notification.

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:55.826 A:middle
And, this is good, because it

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:57.236 A:middle
gives users access to their

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:57.816 A:middle
passwords.

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
But, it's behind that key icon.
