00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.576 A:middle
feature that allows users to

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:02.036 A:middle
enter text on the Apple TV,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.416 A:middle
using their iOS device.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:04.946 A:middle
Let's see it in action.

00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:06.696 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to that

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:08.556 A:middle
shiny app, and I'll select the

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:09.235 A:middle
email field.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:12.416 A:middle
As I expect, I see the

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:13.906 A:middle
continuity keyboard notification

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:15.136 A:middle
appear, which has now been

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:16.666 A:middle
enhanced to offer Password

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:17.466 A:middle
AutoFill as well.

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.136 A:middle
So, I'll open that up now.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:22.946 A:middle
And, I see that my username and

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:24.776 A:middle
password are suggested for the

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:25.906 A:middle
shiny app right there on the

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:26.566 A:middle
QuickType bar.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.236 A:middle
And, I know that with one tap,

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:29.646 A:middle
it'll be automatically filled

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:30.836 A:middle
into the TV, and I'll be signed

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:31.016 A:middle
in.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.000 A:middle
So, I'll do that now.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:35.976 A:middle
Aw, look at that guy.

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:43.286 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:45.386 A:middle
So, I got the notification on my

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:47.146 A:middle
iPhone because my iPhone and

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:48.436 A:middle
Apple TV are on the same iCloud

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:48.856 A:middle
account.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.356 A:middle
And, if you're a user of the TV

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:52.896 A:middle
remote and control center, or

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:54.116 A:middle
the TV remote app, the

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.316 A:middle
experience is similar there as

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:55.536 A:middle
well.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.896 A:middle
But, we have something else

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.256 A:middle
brand new we want to show you

00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:01.496 A:middle
today, that shows just how easy
