00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:01.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ada.

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:06.546 A:middle
Focus interaction is integral in

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:07.906 A:middle
how we feel connected to the

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:08.936 A:middle
screen across the room.

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.726 A:middle
And, tvOS has many common UI

00:25:11.726 --> 00:25:13.256 A:middle
patterns that make the most out

00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:14.386 A:middle
of it.

00:25:14.476 --> 00:25:17.756 A:middle
One such example is a label that

00:25:17.756 --> 00:25:19.006 A:middle
animates its text when it's

00:25:19.006 --> 00:25:19.516 A:middle
focused.

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.606 A:middle
Internally scrolling text, or

00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:25.936 A:middle
marquee animation, is a useful

00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:27.736 A:middle
technique in presenting variable

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:29.426 A:middle
length strings without altering

00:25:29.426 --> 00:25:30.996 A:middle
the label's external geometry.

00:25:31.566 --> 00:25:34.436 A:middle
It's also very effective in

00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:36.256 A:middle
visually highlighting where your

00:25:36.256 --> 00:25:37.516 A:middle
current focus is.

00:25:39.056 --> 00:25:40.676 A:middle
This behavior is very widely

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:43.156 A:middle
used across tvOS, but there's

00:25:43.156 --> 00:25:44.506 A:middle
not an easy way to do this.

00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:46.636 A:middle
That is, until now.

00:25:47.606 --> 00:25:49.356 A:middle
tvOS 12 makes it really easy.

00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:52.786 A:middle
All you have to do is to set a

00:25:52.786 --> 00:25:54.066 A:middle
new property on your label,

00:25:54.946 --> 00:25:55.356 A:middle
enables

00:25:55.356 --> 00:25:56.886 A:middle
MarqueeWhenAncestorFocused to

00:25:56.886 --> 00:25:56.976 A:middle
"true."
