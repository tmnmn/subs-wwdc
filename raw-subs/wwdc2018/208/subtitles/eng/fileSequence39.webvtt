00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:02.316 A:middle
And, finally we looked at

00:39:02.316 --> 00:39:04.796 A:middle
TVUIKit, which makes it really

00:39:04.796 --> 00:39:06.676 A:middle
easy to adopt common UI patterns

00:39:06.676 --> 00:39:07.286 A:middle
on tvOS.

00:39:08.016 --> 00:39:11.156 A:middle
We have a session page with all

00:39:11.156 --> 00:39:12.356 A:middle
of this information and more.

00:39:12.356 --> 00:39:14.076 A:middle
And, we'll be available at the

00:39:14.746 --> 00:39:17.096 A:middle
tvOS labs, and Safari WebKit

00:39:17.096 --> 00:39:18.866 A:middle
labs throughout the week.

00:39:19.516 --> 00:39:20.796 A:middle
Please drop by and say hello,

00:39:20.796 --> 00:39:21.686 A:middle
and bring your questions and

00:39:21.686 --> 00:39:21.996 A:middle
code.

00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:23.596 A:middle
Thanks for joining us this

00:39:23.596 --> 00:39:24.126 A:middle
afternoon.

00:39:24.846 --> 00:39:26.156 A:middle
Have a wonderful WWDC.
