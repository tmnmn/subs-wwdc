00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.646 A:middle
And, since they've been

00:27:00.856 --> 00:27:03.036 A:middle
available in TVMLKit, we see

00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:04.626 A:middle
them adopted in your apps as

00:27:04.626 --> 00:27:04.926 A:middle
well.

00:27:04.926 --> 00:27:07.466 A:middle
But, what if your app is based

00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:08.106 A:middle
on UIKit?

00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:11.446 A:middle
Well, we're really thrilled to

00:27:11.816 --> 00:27:14.856 A:middle
share with you that tvOS 12 will

00:27:14.856 --> 00:27:16.436 A:middle
make several of these available

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:17.966 A:middle
for your UIKit-based apps.

00:27:18.516 --> 00:27:22.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:23.296 --> 00:27:24.806 A:middle
And, we do this through a new

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:26.956 A:middle
lightweight framework, TVUIKit.

00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:30.676 A:middle
The first four elements in

00:27:30.676 --> 00:27:34.386 A:middle
TVUIKit are poster, caption

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:34.736 A:middle
button,

00:27:35.846 --> 00:27:38.016 A:middle
card, and monogram.

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:40.156 A:middle
Let's take a look at each.

00:27:41.846 --> 00:27:43.316 A:middle
Poster view is about images.

00:27:44.306 --> 00:27:46.186 A:middle
And, TVPosterView is a composed

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.986 A:middle
view specializing in presenting

00:27:47.986 --> 00:27:50.256 A:middle
an image, and a footer, which

00:27:50.256 --> 00:27:52.116 A:middle
itself is composed of up to two

00:27:52.116 --> 00:27:52.606 A:middle
labels.

00:27:53.796 --> 00:27:55.146 A:middle
When a poster view is in focus,

00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:57.446 A:middle
the image grows in size, and the

00:27:57.446 --> 00:27:58.926 A:middle
labels move out of the way to

00:27:58.926 --> 00:27:59.526 A:middle
give room.
