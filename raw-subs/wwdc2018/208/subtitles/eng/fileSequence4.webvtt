00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:02.156 A:middle
I'm going to go to my phone.

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.776 A:middle
And, let's sign in.

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:08.546 A:middle
Oh, and even before I can open

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:10.776 A:middle
settings, or ask Siri to look up

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:13.046 A:middle
my password, my iPhone is

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
already offering to help me

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:15.526 A:middle
AutoFill my password.

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:18.406 A:middle
So, I'm going to open up this

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:18.956 A:middle
notification.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.146 A:middle
There we go.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:24.396 A:middle
And, by entering a PIN I know

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:27.226 A:middle
that I am securely connecting to

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:28.386 A:middle
this Apple TV.

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.026 A:middle
Going to Touch ID.

00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:33.246 A:middle
And, my shiny credential appears

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:35.286 A:middle
right at the top, with one tap

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:37.156 A:middle
I'm signed in.

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:37.976 A:middle
Super easy.

00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:40.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:41.316 --> 00:04:44.496 A:middle
Aw. Sorry, it's just-- it's Min.

00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:44.836 A:middle
OK.

00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:47.796 A:middle
Now one thing you might be

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:50.086 A:middle
wondering is how did that work

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:53.606 A:middle
without all the iPhones in the

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:55.456 A:middle
room showing a notification?

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:59.316 A:middle
I think this is really, really

00:04:59.316 --> 00:04:59.586 A:middle
cool.
