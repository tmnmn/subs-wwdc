00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.486 A:middle
It provides the focusItem with a

00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:03.206 A:middle
movement hint that contains raw

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:04.806 A:middle
values you can use to create an

00:16:04.806 --> 00:16:06.706 A:middle
effect that indicates what

00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:08.376 A:middle
direction focus is about to move

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:08.566 A:middle
in.

00:16:09.746 --> 00:16:11.066 A:middle
Finally, you will need to

00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:11.856 A:middle
provide a frame.

00:16:12.256 --> 00:16:14.006 A:middle
As I said before, this frame

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.246 A:middle
must be expressed in the

00:16:15.246 --> 00:16:16.606 A:middle
coordinateSpace of the

00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:18.536 A:middle
containing focusItemContainer.

00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:21.456 A:middle
For example, UIView expresses

00:16:21.496 --> 00:16:23.526 A:middle
its frame in the coordinateSpace

00:16:23.636 --> 00:16:25.866 A:middle
of its superview, which is also

00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:26.816 A:middle
its containing

00:16:26.926 --> 00:16:27.996 A:middle
focusItemContainer.

00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:31.336 A:middle
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:33.006 A:middle
the focusMovementHint object.

00:16:34.186 --> 00:16:35.956 A:middle
Movement direction is a vector,

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.736 A:middle
whose values range between

00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:40.306 A:middle
negative 1, negative 1 and 1,1

00:16:40.636 --> 00:16:42.606 A:middle
representing how close focus is

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:43.956 A:middle
to moving in a particular

00:16:43.956 --> 00:16:44.586 A:middle
direction.

00:16:45.426 --> 00:16:47.676 A:middle
This value is tied to the path a

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:49.276 A:middle
user's finger creates on the

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
touch surface of the Siri

00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:51.056 A:middle
remote.

00:16:52.456 --> 00:16:54.546 A:middle
Perspective, rotation, and

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.686 A:middle
translation are all values you

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:59.006 A:middle
can use to match tvOS's native

00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:00.106 A:middle
interaction hinting.
