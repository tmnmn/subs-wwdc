00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
stored in the passcodeToVerify,

00:37:00.366 --> 00:37:01.606 A:middle
we know they are verifying it.

00:37:01.606 --> 00:37:02.646 A:middle
And, we check to make sure

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:03.116 A:middle
they're equal.

00:37:03.306 --> 00:37:05.126 A:middle
If they are, we save the new

00:37:05.126 --> 00:37:06.646 A:middle
passcode, and dismiss the

00:37:06.646 --> 00:37:07.236 A:middle
viewController.

00:37:07.626 --> 00:37:09.456 A:middle
Otherwise, we reset the prompt

00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:10.726 A:middle
text back to what we originally

00:37:10.726 --> 00:37:13.096 A:middle
asked, clear the entry, and then

00:37:13.296 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
set the passcodeToVerify to nil

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:15.546 A:middle
so they can try again.

00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:17.336 A:middle
And, finally we present our

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:17.886 A:middle
viewController.

00:37:22.046 --> 00:37:22.976 A:middle
So, now we're going to go to

00:37:22.976 --> 00:37:23.326 A:middle
Settings.

00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:24.756 A:middle
It's going to ask us to please

00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:25.646 A:middle
set a passcode.

00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:27.156 A:middle
Let's go ahead and set it all

00:37:27.156 --> 00:37:27.866 A:middle
1's first.

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:29.436 A:middle
Now it's asked us to verify.

00:37:29.586 --> 00:37:30.556 A:middle
But, this time I'm going to

00:37:30.556 --> 00:37:31.146 A:middle
enter all 2's.

00:37:32.146 --> 00:37:32.836 A:middle
Since we know that was

00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:33.376 A:middle
incorrect.

00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:35.136 A:middle
So, now let's do it correctly

00:37:35.136 --> 00:37:35.526 A:middle
this time.

00:37:36.376 --> 00:37:37.716 A:middle
We've got five 1's, we're going

00:37:37.716 --> 00:37:38.796 A:middle
to verify our PIN code.

00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:40.756 A:middle
And, we can save the PIN code so

00:37:40.756 --> 00:37:42.026 A:middle
the user can use it when they

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:42.336 A:middle
need to.

00:37:42.566 --> 00:37:44.226 A:middle
And, that's how you can

00:37:44.226 --> 00:37:44.626 A:middle
implement

00:37:44.626 --> 00:37:46.896 A:middle
TVDigitEntryViewController into

00:37:46.896 --> 00:37:47.546 A:middle
your application.

00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:48.756 A:middle
I'd like to invite Hans back up

00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:48.976 A:middle
on stage.

00:37:49.516 --> 00:37:52.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:53.046 --> 00:37:53.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Marshall.

00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:56.586 A:middle
That was a great demo showing

00:37:56.586 --> 00:37:58.196 A:middle
just how easy it is to adopt a

00:37:58.196 --> 00:37:59.726 A:middle
common UI patterns, using

00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:00.446 A:middle
TVUIKit.
