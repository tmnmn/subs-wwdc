00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:00.546 A:middle
When you're providing your own

00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:03.396 A:middle
content to the TVLockupView, you

00:32:03.396 --> 00:32:05.166 A:middle
can take advantage of

00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:07.186 A:middle
TVLockupViewComponent protocol.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:10.216 A:middle
Whenever TVLockupView state

00:32:10.216 --> 00:32:11.896 A:middle
changes, it will call

00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:13.066 A:middle
updateAppearance

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:15.736 A:middle
forLockupViewState method on all

00:32:15.736 --> 00:32:16.956 A:middle
of its subviews that implement

00:32:16.956 --> 00:32:17.096 A:middle
it.

00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:19.286 A:middle
This is your subviews

00:32:19.286 --> 00:32:21.026 A:middle
opportunity to update its

00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:22.936 A:middle
behavior, or customize the

00:32:23.476 --> 00:32:27.766 A:middle
appearance based on the state.

00:32:28.286 --> 00:32:30.186 A:middle
You can use TVLockupView to

00:32:30.186 --> 00:32:31.696 A:middle
create your own widget that

00:32:31.696 --> 00:32:33.076 A:middle
responds to focus interaction,

00:32:33.716 --> 00:32:35.986 A:middle
or further customize the four

00:32:35.986 --> 00:32:37.926 A:middle
special purpose subclasses we

00:32:37.926 --> 00:32:38.736 A:middle
just discussed.

00:32:39.476 --> 00:32:43.796 A:middle
So, that's TVLockupView and its

00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:44.686 A:middle
subclasses.

00:32:45.146 --> 00:32:47.256 A:middle
Finally, you may recall seeing

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:47.976 A:middle
something like this.

00:32:49.936 --> 00:32:52.316 A:middle
It's simple, but its simplicity

00:32:52.316 --> 00:32:53.966 A:middle
disguises just how difficult it

00:32:53.966 --> 00:32:57.606 A:middle
is to implement this screen.

00:32:57.786 --> 00:32:59.686 A:middle
TVUIKit makes it really easy to

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.276 A:middle
do this, and that's with
