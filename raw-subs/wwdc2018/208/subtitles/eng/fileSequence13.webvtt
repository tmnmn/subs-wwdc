00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:00.596 A:middle
currently focused item off of

00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:01.466 A:middle
the focusSystem.

00:13:02.346 --> 00:13:04.256 A:middle
Next, we are introducing a new

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:05.346 A:middle
protocol, called

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:07.446 A:middle
UIFocusItemContainer, which

00:13:07.446 --> 00:13:09.306 A:middle
provides geometric context to

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.056 A:middle
Focus items.

00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:13.416 A:middle
A focusItemContainer is owned by

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:15.276 A:middle
a focusEnvironment, and can

00:13:15.276 --> 00:13:17.136 A:middle
locate focus items within

00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:19.076 A:middle
specific regions, allowing the

00:13:19.076 --> 00:13:20.826 A:middle
focus engine to move focus to

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:21.886 A:middle
the best candidate.

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:25.476 A:middle
Next, we have a special type of

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:27.046 A:middle
focusItemContainer, called

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:28.836 A:middle
focusItemScrollableContainer,

00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:30.236 A:middle
which adds support for

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:31.646 A:middle
automatically scrolling through

00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:33.426 A:middle
content as focus is moved.

00:13:34.516 --> 00:13:36.606 A:middle
And, finally, we now supply

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:38.846 A:middle
focusItems with movement hints,

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:40.726 A:middle
which contain raw values that

00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:42.206 A:middle
you can use to create visual

00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:44.236 A:middle
effects that suggest what

00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:46.056 A:middle
direction focus is about to move

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:46.266 A:middle
in.

00:13:47.266 --> 00:13:49.446 A:middle
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:51.346 A:middle
how we can form our own classes

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:52.246 A:middle
to these protocols.

00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:54.576 A:middle
Let's start by implementing a

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:56.056 A:middle
custom focusEnvironment.

00:13:56.826 --> 00:13:58.586 A:middle
In order for the focus engine to

00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:00.666 A:middle
find your environment, and its
