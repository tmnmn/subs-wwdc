00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:02.966 A:middle
When it relinquishes focus, the

00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:04.506 A:middle
image and labels come back to

00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:05.226 A:middle
the normal layout.

00:28:06.446 --> 00:28:08.156 A:middle
When you program an image to a

00:28:08.156 --> 00:28:10.506 A:middle
TVPosterView, it works out just

00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:11.946 A:middle
the right amount by which the

00:28:11.946 --> 00:28:12.616 A:middle
image grows.

00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:15.986 A:middle
And, TVPosterView is an ideal

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:18.456 A:middle
API for creating a UI like this.

00:28:19.006 --> 00:28:19.786 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:28:20.476 --> 00:28:23.296 A:middle
And, that's TVPosterView.

00:28:24.776 --> 00:28:26.166 A:middle
Next, is caption button.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:28.526 A:middle
Caption button is about

00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:29.336 A:middle
call-to-action.

00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:34.156 A:middle
And, TVCaptionButtonView is a

00:28:34.156 --> 00:28:35.896 A:middle
composed view specializing in

00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:37.276 A:middle
presenting a button-like

00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:40.226 A:middle
content, and a footer, which

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:41.806 A:middle
itself is composed of up to two

00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:42.156 A:middle
labels.

00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:45.306 A:middle
The content view has a blurred

00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:47.366 A:middle
background, and can either have

00:28:47.366 --> 00:28:49.266 A:middle
an image, or a text.

00:28:51.046 --> 00:28:52.366 A:middle
When a CaptionButtonView is in

00:28:52.366 --> 00:28:57.106 A:middle
focus, it floats and unlike the

00:28:57.106 --> 00:28:59.176 A:middle
PosterView, it increases its

00:28:59.216 --> 00:29:01.376 A:middle
size only in the leading, top,
