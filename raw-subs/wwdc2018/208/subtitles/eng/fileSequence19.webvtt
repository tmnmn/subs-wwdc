00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:02.206 A:middle
for a more in-depth look at how

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:04.576 A:middle
focus and voiceover work

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.116 A:middle
together in tvOS.

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:10.336 A:middle
And now, I'd like to invite my

00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:12.026 A:middle
colleague, Paul, to give us a

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.406 A:middle
demo on how to create a

00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:14.886 A:middle
focus-powered Metal app.

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:21.516 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:22.016 --> 00:19:22.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ada.

00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:25.036 A:middle
So, I'm working on the setting

00:19:25.036 --> 00:19:26.576 A:middle
screen for a Metal-based game.

00:19:27.136 --> 00:19:28.156 A:middle
At the bottom of the screen,

00:19:28.306 --> 00:19:29.226 A:middle
there's some standard UI

00:19:29.226 --> 00:19:29.646 A:middle
buttons.

00:19:30.426 --> 00:19:32.116 A:middle
And, up at the top are some

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:33.406 A:middle
tiles for selecting levels.

00:19:34.086 --> 00:19:35.076 A:middle
These tiles are actually

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.006 A:middle
rendered by the game engine

00:19:36.006 --> 00:19:36.526 A:middle
itself.

00:19:36.906 --> 00:19:37.736 A:middle
I'm sure you can tell by the

00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:38.986 A:middle
incredible 3D graphics that you

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:39.516 A:middle
see up there.

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:41.736 A:middle
So, I want to be able to select

00:19:41.736 --> 00:19:43.216 A:middle
the tiles using the remote.

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:45.646 A:middle
Previously, I would have had to

00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:46.616 A:middle
handle events from the remote

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:48.596 A:middle
myself, and implement my own

00:19:48.596 --> 00:19:50.446 A:middle
navigation, trying my best to

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.466 A:middle
match the feel of the focus

00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:51.806 A:middle
engine.

00:19:52.306 --> 00:19:54.256 A:middle
In tvOS 12, I can connect these

00:19:54.256 --> 00:19:55.706 A:middle
tiles directly to the focus

00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:56.016 A:middle
engine.

00:19:56.016 --> 00:19:56.976 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and do that.
