00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.206 A:middle
In UIKit, UIViewController is a

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:01.696 A:middle
great example of a focus

00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:02.316 A:middle
environment.

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:05.526 A:middle
Next, we have UIFocusItem.

00:12:06.336 --> 00:12:08.036 A:middle
This protocol inherits from

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:09.756 A:middle
FocusEnvironment, and adds the

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:11.326 A:middle
ability for focus items to

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:12.636 A:middle
actually be able to become

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:13.246 A:middle
focused.

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:16.186 A:middle
UIKit's UIView, and SpriteKit's

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:18.156 A:middle
SKNode are great examples of

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:19.036 A:middle
focus items.

00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:21.746 A:middle
And, finally we have the

00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:23.666 A:middle
UIFocusSystem, which provides

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:24.736 A:middle
the famously useful

00:12:24.736 --> 00:12:26.556 A:middle
functionality of being able to

00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:28.616 A:middle
register custom sounds to play

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:30.216 A:middle
during focus interactions.

00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
For more information on how to

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:34.706 A:middle
work with these components, and

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:37.036 A:middle
debug focus, I highly recommend

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.176 A:middle
that you watch "Focus

00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:40.476 A:middle
Interaction in tvOS 11" from

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:41.096 A:middle
last year.

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:44.286 A:middle
And now, I'm really excited to

00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:46.196 A:middle
introduce some new components to

00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:47.076 A:middle
the focus engine.

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:50.756 A:middle
First, starting in tvOS 12, we

00:12:50.756 --> 00:12:52.486 A:middle
are expanding the functionality

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:54.056 A:middle
of the focusSystem object.

00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:55.496 A:middle
You may now retrieve a

00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:56.996 A:middle
focusSystem for a given

00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.926 A:middle
environment, and access the

00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:00.596 A:middle
currently focused item off of
