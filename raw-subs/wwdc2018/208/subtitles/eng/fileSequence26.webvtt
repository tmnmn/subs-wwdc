[ Applause ]

00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:04.316 A:middle
Then, when a view containing the

00:26:04.316 --> 00:26:06.136 A:middle
label comes in focus, and the

00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:07.936 A:middle
label contains a string, it's

00:26:08.086 --> 00:26:09.846 A:middle
too long for the width.

00:26:11.406 --> 00:26:13.486 A:middle
It will animate the string

00:26:14.416 --> 00:26:15.456 A:middle
horizontally in a loop.

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:19.046 A:middle
We've used this API ourselves,

00:26:19.046 --> 00:26:20.286 A:middle
and we think you will really

00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:21.656 A:middle
like how simple it is to adopt

00:26:21.656 --> 00:26:22.256 A:middle
the behavior.

00:26:23.436 --> 00:26:24.976 A:middle
So, that's text scrolling in UI

00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:25.256 A:middle
label.

00:26:27.246 --> 00:26:30.256 A:middle
But, tvOS has many more idioms

00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:33.066 A:middle
and patterns, such as an image

00:26:33.066 --> 00:26:35.316 A:middle
and a label when come alive when

00:26:36.056 --> 00:26:39.116 A:middle
in focus, an arbitrary view

00:26:39.116 --> 00:26:40.636 A:middle
hierarchy that floats as one

00:26:40.636 --> 00:26:45.526 A:middle
solid unit, buttons with

00:26:45.526 --> 00:26:47.346 A:middle
customizable focus movement and

00:26:47.346 --> 00:26:47.766 A:middle
content,

00:26:50.986 --> 00:26:52.276 A:middle
and widgets for representing

00:26:52.276 --> 00:26:52.666 A:middle
people.

00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:55.536 A:middle
And, as you can see, these

00:26:55.536 --> 00:26:57.466 A:middle
patterns are ubiquitous across

00:26:57.466 --> 00:26:58.626 A:middle
tvOS and Apple's own apps.

00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.646 A:middle
And, since they've been
