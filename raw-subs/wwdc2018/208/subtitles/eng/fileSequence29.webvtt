00:28:59.216 --> 00:29:01.376 A:middle
size only in the leading, top,

00:29:01.376 --> 00:29:03.106 A:middle
and trailing directions.

00:29:03.636 --> 00:29:06.276 A:middle
You can also limit the floating

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:10.106 A:middle
motion to horizontal only or

00:29:10.246 --> 00:29:10.956 A:middle
vertical only.

00:29:12.506 --> 00:29:13.956 A:middle
And, when you use multiple

00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:15.926 A:middle
TVCaptionButtons and give them a

00:29:15.926 --> 00:29:18.026 A:middle
consistent motion direction, you

00:29:18.026 --> 00:29:19.466 A:middle
can create a sense of grouping.

00:29:20.256 --> 00:29:21.976 A:middle
And, TVCaptionButton makes it

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:22.976 A:middle
really easy to do this.

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:26.816 A:middle
Next, is CardView.

00:29:28.836 --> 00:29:30.616 A:middle
CardView is about custom views.

00:29:32.296 --> 00:29:34.576 A:middle
And, TVCardView specializes in

00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:36.406 A:middle
presenting arbitrarily composed

00:29:36.406 --> 00:29:37.166 A:middle
view hierarchy.

00:29:38.346 --> 00:29:41.066 A:middle
When a CardView is in focus,

00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:44.146 A:middle
it's content view floats and all

00:29:44.146 --> 00:29:46.356 A:middle
of its subviews move in unison

00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:48.226 A:middle
as part of the floating content

00:29:48.906 --> 00:29:49.016 A:middle
view.

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.226 A:middle
TVCardView is a great way to

00:29:53.226 --> 00:29:56.296 A:middle
create a UI like this.

00:29:57.016 --> 00:29:59.956 A:middle
It's really straightforward.
