00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:01.636 A:middle
UIFocusEnvironment objects.

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.666 A:middle
First, we'll try to grab text

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:05.766 A:middle
out of our username and password

00:09:05.766 --> 00:09:06.106 A:middle
fields.

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.606 A:middle
And, if we can, we'll just

00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:08.806 A:middle
return that login button to the

00:09:08.806 --> 00:09:09.476 A:middle
focus engine.

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:11.486 A:middle
If we weren't able to grab any

00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:12.956 A:middle
text, that just means the user

00:09:12.956 --> 00:09:14.186 A:middle
hasn't entered any yet.

00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:16.036 A:middle
So, we'll return the username

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:17.306 A:middle
text field to be focused.

00:09:18.136 --> 00:09:18.736 A:middle
Super simple.

00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:21.656 A:middle
So, let's recap some of the

00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:23.056 A:middle
major takeaways of Password

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:23.566 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:27.856 A:middle
For customers, Password AutoFill

00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
reduces the friction within your

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:32.006 A:middle
app by enabling a one-tap sign

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:32.986 A:middle
in experience.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:35.316 A:middle
If any adoption is needed on

00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:37.266 A:middle
your part for developers, this

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:38.076 A:middle
is super simple.

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.296 A:middle
You simply have to just adopt

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:44.876 A:middle
UITextContentTypes, adopt

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.376 A:middle
Associated Domains so that your

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:47.886 A:middle
apps credentials are surfaced to

00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:48.646 A:middle
the QuickType bar.

00:09:50.086 --> 00:09:51.436 A:middle
And, lastly, implement

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:53.116 A:middle
preferredFocusEnvironments to

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:55.006 A:middle
enable that one-tap sign in

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:55.696 A:middle
experience.

00:09:56.736 --> 00:09:57.916 A:middle
And that's Password AutoFill for

00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:58.536 A:middle
tvOS.

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.436 A:middle
We cannot wait for you and your
