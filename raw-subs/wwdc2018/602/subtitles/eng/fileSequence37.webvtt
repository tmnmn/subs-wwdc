00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:01.956 A:middle
It also informs about which

00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:03.566 A:middle
image has been detected and

00:37:03.566 --> 00:37:06.176 A:middle
where it is by giving me it's

00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:08.536 A:middle
position and orientation as a 4

00:37:08.536 --> 00:37:09.956 A:middle
by 4 matrix.

00:37:11.496 --> 00:37:13.326 A:middle
So in order to get such image

00:37:13.326 --> 00:37:14.896 A:middle
anchors, it all starts by

00:37:14.896 --> 00:37:15.646 A:middle
loading images.

00:37:15.726 --> 00:37:16.676 A:middle
So that's good.

00:37:16.906 --> 00:37:18.176 A:middle
Let's have a look at what good

00:37:18.216 --> 00:37:19.096 A:middle
images could be.

00:37:19.846 --> 00:37:21.426 A:middle
This image here could be found

00:37:21.486 --> 00:37:23.476 A:middle
in a book for children, and in

00:37:23.476 --> 00:37:25.686 A:middle
fact, it works great for image

00:37:25.686 --> 00:37:26.066 A:middle
tracking.

00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:27.976 A:middle
It has a lot of distinct visual

00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:28.496 A:middle
features.

00:37:28.806 --> 00:37:30.346 A:middle
It's we'll textured and shows

00:37:30.346 --> 00:37:31.096 A:middle
really good contrast.

00:37:32.566 --> 00:37:34.236 A:middle
On the other hand, an image like

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:36.076 A:middle
this, which could also be found

00:37:36.076 --> 00:37:39.446 A:middle
in a textbook for kids, is not

00:37:39.446 --> 00:37:39.986 A:middle
recommended.

00:37:40.756 --> 00:37:41.646 A:middle
It has a lot of repetitive

00:37:41.646 --> 00:37:43.326 A:middle
structures, uniform color

00:37:43.326 --> 00:37:44.876 A:middle
regions, and a pretty narrow

00:37:44.876 --> 00:37:46.666 A:middle
histogram once converted to gray

00:37:46.666 --> 00:37:46.946 A:middle
scale.

00:37:48.436 --> 00:37:49.586 A:middle
But you don't have to identify

00:37:49.586 --> 00:37:50.966 A:middle
these statistics yourself as

00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:52.066 A:middle
Xcode is here to help.

00:37:52.926 --> 00:37:54.716 A:middle
So if I import these two images

00:37:54.716 --> 00:37:57.286 A:middle
to Xcode, I see the sea life one

00:37:57.586 --> 00:37:59.216 A:middle
without any warning, which means

00:37:59.216 --> 00:38:01.296 A:middle
it's recommended, and the one
