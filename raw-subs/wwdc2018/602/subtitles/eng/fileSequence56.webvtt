00:55:59.926 --> 00:56:01.226 A:middle
All of this is made available

00:56:01.226 --> 00:56:02.736 A:middle
for you in the form of the

00:56:02.736 --> 00:56:04.256 A:middle
building blocks of ARKit.

00:56:05.336 --> 00:56:08.016 A:middle
In iOS 12, ARKit features five

00:56:08.066 --> 00:56:09.456 A:middle
different configurations with

00:56:09.456 --> 00:56:10.876 A:middle
two new additions, the

00:56:10.876 --> 00:56:12.556 A:middle
ARImageTrackingConfiguration for

00:56:12.556 --> 00:56:15.116 A:middle
stand-alone image tracking and

00:56:15.196 --> 00:56:15.306 A:middle
the

00:56:15.306 --> 00:56:16.766 A:middle
ARObjectScanningConfiguration.

00:56:18.056 --> 00:56:19.146 A:middle
And there's a series of

00:56:19.746 --> 00:56:21.456 A:middle
supplementary types used to

00:56:21.456 --> 00:56:22.716 A:middle
interact with the AR session.

00:56:23.426 --> 00:56:25.036 A:middle
The ARFrame, the ARCamera, for

00:56:25.166 --> 00:56:25.486 A:middle
example.

00:56:26.686 --> 00:56:27.906 A:middle
And this got two new additions,

00:56:27.996 --> 00:56:29.546 A:middle
the ARReferenceObject for object

00:56:29.546 --> 00:56:31.706 A:middle
detection and the ARWorldMap for

00:56:31.766 --> 00:56:33.366 A:middle
persistence and multiuser.

00:56:33.896 --> 00:56:36.306 A:middle
And the AR anchors, which

00:56:36.306 --> 00:56:37.836 A:middle
represent positions in the real

00:56:37.836 --> 00:56:39.276 A:middle
world, the anchor types.

00:56:39.586 --> 00:56:41.166 A:middle
Got two new additions, the

00:56:41.166 --> 00:56:43.016 A:middle
ARObjectAnchor and the

00:56:43.016 --> 00:56:44.176 A:middle
AREnvironmentProbeAnchor.

00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:46.976 A:middle
I'm really excited to see what

00:56:46.976 --> 00:56:48.156 A:middle
you guys will build with all

00:56:48.156 --> 00:56:49.226 A:middle
these building blocks in the

00:56:49.226 --> 00:56:51.886 A:middle
ARKit available in iOS 12 as of

00:56:51.936 --> 00:56:52.176 A:middle
today.

00:56:54.516 --> 00:57:00.506 A:middle
