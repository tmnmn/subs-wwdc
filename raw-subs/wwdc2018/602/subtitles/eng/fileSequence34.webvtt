00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:01.326 A:middle
Image detection searches for

00:34:01.326 --> 00:34:03.086 A:middle
known 2D images in the scene.

00:34:03.776 --> 00:34:05.836 A:middle
The term detection here implies

00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:07.996 A:middle
that these images are static and

00:34:07.996 --> 00:34:09.126 A:middle
are therefore not supposed to

00:34:09.126 --> 00:34:09.396 A:middle
move.

00:34:10.326 --> 00:34:11.626 A:middle
Great examples for such images

00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:13.576 A:middle
could be movie posters or

00:34:13.576 --> 00:34:14.746 A:middle
paintings in a museum.

00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:18.536 A:middle
ARKit will estimate the position

00:34:18.636 --> 00:34:20.156 A:middle
and orientation of such an image

00:34:20.466 --> 00:34:22.216 A:middle
in six degrees of freedom once

00:34:22.216 --> 00:34:23.416 A:middle
an image has been detected.

00:34:24.536 --> 00:34:26.446 A:middle
This pose can be used to trigger

00:34:26.446 --> 00:34:28.005 A:middle
content in your rendered scene.

00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:31.576 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, all this

00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:33.065 A:middle
is fully integrated world

00:34:33.065 --> 00:34:33.505 A:middle
tracking.

00:34:34.065 --> 00:34:35.065 A:middle
So all you need to do is set

00:34:35.065 --> 00:34:37.626 A:middle
once in your property to set it

00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:38.746 A:middle
up.

00:34:39.025 --> 00:34:40.255 A:middle
In order to load images to be

00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:42.386 A:middle
used for image detection, you

00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:44.275 A:middle
made load them from file or use

00:34:44.346 --> 00:34:46.196 A:middle
Xcode's asset catalog, which

00:34:46.196 --> 00:34:47.946 A:middle
also gives you the detection

00:34:47.946 --> 00:34:49.056 A:middle
quality for an image.

00:34:50.406 --> 00:34:51.496 A:middle
So image detection is already

00:34:51.496 --> 00:34:54.275 A:middle
great, but now in iOS 12, we can

00:34:54.275 --> 00:34:54.735 A:middle
do better.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.636 A:middle
So let's talk about image

00:34:56.636 --> 00:34:56.976 A:middle
tracking.

00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:59.636 A:middle
Image tracking is an extension

00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.546 A:middle
to image detection with a big
