00:47:00.596 --> 00:47:01.936 A:middle
In this case, I envision to

00:47:01.936 --> 00:47:04.896 A:middle
build a simple AR museum app by

00:47:04.896 --> 00:47:07.016 A:middle
detecting an ancient bust and a

00:47:07.016 --> 00:47:07.546 A:middle
clay pot.

00:47:07.546 --> 00:47:10.726 A:middle
And I use this to run my

00:47:10.806 --> 00:47:11.126 A:middle
session.

00:47:12.436 --> 00:47:14.696 A:middle
So in fact, at the office, we

00:47:14.696 --> 00:47:16.616 A:middle
build a very simple AR museum

00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:18.556 A:middle
app, so let's have a look.

00:47:19.126 --> 00:47:23.166 A:middle
So once this bust gets into view

00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:25.456 A:middle
of my iOS app, I get a six

00:47:25.456 --> 00:47:26.996 A:middle
degrees of freedom pose and can

00:47:26.996 --> 00:47:29.426 A:middle
use this to show the scene, very

00:47:29.426 --> 00:47:31.246 A:middle
simple infographics floating

00:47:31.246 --> 00:47:32.026 A:middle
about the statue.

00:47:32.906 --> 00:47:33.926 A:middle
In this case, we have simply

00:47:33.926 --> 00:47:36.366 A:middle
added date of birth, the name of

00:47:36.366 --> 00:47:37.496 A:middle
this Egyptian queen, which was

00:47:37.496 --> 00:47:39.906 A:middle
Nefertiti, but you could add any

00:47:39.906 --> 00:47:40.956 A:middle
content that your rendering

00:47:40.956 --> 00:47:43.576 A:middle
engine allows you to use.

00:47:43.956 --> 00:47:45.846 A:middle
In order to build this app, I

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.386 A:middle
had to scan the object first.

00:47:48.066 --> 00:47:49.266 A:middle
So let's talk about object

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:49.756 A:middle
scanning.

00:47:50.236 --> 00:47:53.306 A:middle
Object scanning extracts

00:47:53.426 --> 00:47:54.956 A:middle
accumulated scene information

00:47:55.216 --> 00:47:55.736 A:middle
from the world.

00:47:56.636 --> 00:47:58.506 A:middle
This is very much related to

00:47:58.506 --> 00:48:00.736 A:middle
plane estimation in which we use
