00:27:55.116 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
Let's see how ARKit API makes it

00:28:00.286 --> 00:28:03.446 A:middle
very easy for you to enable this

00:28:07.516 --> 00:28:07.686 A:middle
feature.

00:28:07.836 --> 00:28:09.966 A:middle
So all you have to do in your

00:28:09.966 --> 00:28:12.516 A:middle
world tracking configuration to

00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:14.006 A:middle
set environment texturing

00:28:14.006 --> 00:28:17.776 A:middle
property to automatic and run

00:28:17.776 --> 00:28:18.206 A:middle
the session.

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:21.206 A:middle
So this is as simple as this.

00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:28.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:29.076 --> 00:28:31.186 A:middle
AR session will automatically

00:28:31.186 --> 00:28:32.946 A:middle
run this environment texturing

00:28:32.946 --> 00:28:34.976 A:middle
process in the background and

00:28:34.976 --> 00:28:36.326 A:middle
will give you environment

00:28:36.546 --> 00:28:39.316 A:middle
texture as an environment probe

00:28:39.316 --> 00:28:39.616 A:middle
anchor.

00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:43.416 A:middle
AREnvironmentProbeAnchor is an

00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:45.226 A:middle
extension of AR anchor, so it

00:28:45.226 --> 00:28:46.916 A:middle
means it has a six degrees of

00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:48.496 A:middle
freedom position and orientation

00:28:48.496 --> 00:28:49.066 A:middle
transform.

00:28:50.716 --> 00:28:53.346 A:middle
Moreover, it has a cube map in

00:28:53.346 --> 00:28:58.596 A:middle
the form of metal texture.

00:28:58.596 --> 00:29:00.336 A:middle
ARKit also gives you physical
