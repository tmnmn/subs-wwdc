00:21:58.346 --> 00:22:01.676 A:middle
Note that 4 by 3 video format

00:22:01.676 --> 00:22:03.606 A:middle
will be the default video format

00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:06.556 A:middle
in ARKit 2.

00:22:06.816 --> 00:22:08.326 A:middle
So all of these enhancements,

00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:10.896 A:middle
they will be applied to all

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.486 A:middle
existing apps in the App Store

00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:15.406 A:middle
except 4 by 3 video format.

00:22:15.536 --> 00:22:18.176 A:middle
For that, you will have to build

00:22:18.176 --> 00:22:20.086 A:middle
your app with the new STK.

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:26.506 A:middle
So coming back to improving

00:22:26.506 --> 00:22:30.636 A:middle
end-user experience, we are

00:22:30.876 --> 00:22:32.316 A:middle
introducing environment

00:22:32.316 --> 00:22:32.806 A:middle
texturing.

00:22:33.876 --> 00:22:36.116 A:middle
So this greatly enhances your

00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:38.176 A:middle
rendering for end-user

00:22:38.176 --> 00:22:38.876 A:middle
experiences.

00:22:40.976 --> 00:22:43.826 A:middle
So let's say your designer have

00:22:44.016 --> 00:22:45.496 A:middle
worked really hard to create

00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:47.486 A:middle
these virtual objects for you,

00:22:47.776 --> 00:22:49.156 A:middle
for your augmented reality

00:22:49.696 --> 00:22:49.786 A:middle
scene.

00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:53.466 A:middle
This looks really great, but you

00:22:53.466 --> 00:22:56.226 A:middle
need to do more for your

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:57.316 A:middle
augmented reality scene.

00:22:57.316 --> 00:23:03.046 A:middle
You need to have position and
