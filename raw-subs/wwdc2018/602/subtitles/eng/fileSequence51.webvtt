00:50:57.666 --> 00:51:00.016 A:middle
raw feature points found within

00:51:00.016 --> 00:51:02.236 A:middle
the area when you performed your

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:02.486 A:middle
scan.

00:51:05.386 --> 00:51:06.686 A:middle
So this was object detection.

00:51:07.256 --> 00:51:08.896 A:middle
Keep in mind, before detection

00:51:08.896 --> 00:51:10.616 A:middle
object, you need to scan them,

00:51:10.616 --> 00:51:11.956 A:middle
but there is the full source

00:51:11.956 --> 00:51:13.196 A:middle
code available for you to

00:51:13.196 --> 00:51:16.286 A:middle
download it right now.

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.926 A:middle
So let's talk next about face

00:51:18.926 --> 00:51:19.266 A:middle
tracking.

00:51:24.546 --> 00:51:26.296 A:middle
When we released the iPhone X

00:51:26.296 --> 00:51:28.166 A:middle
last year, we added robust face

00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:29.776 A:middle
detection and tracking to ARKit.

00:51:30.746 --> 00:51:32.276 A:middle
Here, ARKit estimates the

00:51:32.276 --> 00:51:33.816 A:middle
position and orientation of a

00:51:33.876 --> 00:51:36.186 A:middle
face for every frame at 60

00:51:36.186 --> 00:51:37.006 A:middle
frames per second.

00:51:37.826 --> 00:51:39.586 A:middle
Here we can use the, this pose

00:51:39.586 --> 00:51:41.576 A:middle
can be used to augment a user's

00:51:41.576 --> 00:51:44.206 A:middle
face by adding masks, hats, or

00:51:44.206 --> 00:51:45.746 A:middle
replace the full texture of a

00:51:46.776 --> 00:51:46.906 A:middle
face.

00:51:47.816 --> 00:51:48.956 A:middle
ARKit also provides you with a

00:51:48.956 --> 00:51:50.536 A:middle
fitted triangle mesh coming to

00:51:50.536 --> 00:51:52.016 A:middle
form of the ARFaceGeometry.

00:51:52.566 --> 00:51:56.136 A:middle
This type, the ARFaceGeometry,

00:51:56.136 --> 00:51:57.636 A:middle
contains all the information

00:51:57.636 --> 00:51:59.326 A:middle
needed to render this facial

00:51:59.326 --> 00:52:01.916 A:middle
mesh, and it comes in the form
