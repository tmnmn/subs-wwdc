00:28:58.596 --> 00:29:00.336 A:middle
ARKit also gives you physical

00:29:00.336 --> 00:29:02.356 A:middle
extent of the cube map.

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:04.546 A:middle
So this is area of the influence

00:29:04.836 --> 00:29:08.176 A:middle
of the reflection probe, and it

00:29:08.176 --> 00:29:10.786 A:middle
can be used by rendering agents

00:29:11.246 --> 00:29:12.846 A:middle
to correct for parallels.

00:29:12.846 --> 00:29:14.176 A:middle
So such as in case your object

00:29:14.176 --> 00:29:16.186 A:middle
is moving in the scene, it will

00:29:16.186 --> 00:29:18.636 A:middle
automatically adapt to new

00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:21.226 A:middle
position and new texture will be

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:22.226 A:middle
reflected in the environment.

00:29:22.686 --> 00:29:26.666 A:middle
Note that this follows same

00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:28.476 A:middle
lifecycle as every other anchor

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.166 A:middle
such as AR plane anchor or AR

00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:31.676 A:middle
image anchor.

00:29:36.676 --> 00:29:38.396 A:middle
Furthermore, it is fully

00:29:38.396 --> 00:29:40.566 A:middle
integrated into ARSCNView.

00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:42.396 A:middle
So in case you are using

00:29:42.646 --> 00:29:44.216 A:middle
SceneKit as your rendering

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:47.136 A:middle
technology, you just need to

00:29:47.136 --> 00:29:49.586 A:middle
enable this feature in world

00:29:49.586 --> 00:29:50.486 A:middle
tracking configuration.

00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:52.706 A:middle
The rest is done automatically

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:54.076 A:middle
by ARSCNView.

00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:02.146 A:middle
Note that for advanced use
