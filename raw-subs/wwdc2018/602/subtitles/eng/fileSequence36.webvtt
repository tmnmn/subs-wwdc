00:36:00.016 --> 00:36:01.566 A:middle
We start by loading a set of

00:36:01.656 --> 00:36:02.736 A:middle
reference images, either from

00:36:02.736 --> 00:36:04.456 A:middle
file or from the asset catalog.

00:36:05.676 --> 00:36:07.246 A:middle
Once I'm done loading such a set

00:36:07.246 --> 00:36:09.276 A:middle
of reference images, I use this

00:36:09.966 --> 00:36:11.596 A:middle
to set up my session that can be

00:36:11.676 --> 00:36:13.726 A:middle
of type world tracking by

00:36:13.806 --> 00:36:15.226 A:middle
specifying its detection images

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:17.026 A:middle
property or of type

00:36:17.026 --> 00:36:19.386 A:middle
ARImageTrackingConfiguration by

00:36:19.386 --> 00:36:20.786 A:middle
specifying the tracking images

00:36:20.826 --> 00:36:20.986 A:middle
one.

00:36:22.406 --> 00:36:24.036 A:middle
Once I'm done setting up my

00:36:24.036 --> 00:36:26.316 A:middle
configuration, I use this to run

00:36:26.316 --> 00:36:26.846 A:middle
my session.

00:36:28.296 --> 00:36:30.276 A:middle
And just as usual, once the

00:36:30.326 --> 00:36:31.966 A:middle
session is running, I'll get an

00:36:31.966 --> 00:36:33.496 A:middle
ARFrame at every update.

00:36:34.476 --> 00:36:35.776 A:middle
And such and ARFrame will

00:36:35.776 --> 00:36:37.486 A:middle
continue an object of type

00:36:37.676 --> 00:36:40.116 A:middle
ARImageAnchor, once an image has

00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:40.676 A:middle
been detected.

00:36:41.036 --> 00:36:44.086 A:middle
Such an ARImageAnchor is now a

00:36:44.086 --> 00:36:45.066 A:middle
trackable object.

00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:46.836 A:middle
I can see this by conforming to

00:36:46.836 --> 00:36:48.086 A:middle
the AR trackable protocol.

00:36:48.786 --> 00:36:51.346 A:middle
This means it comes as a boolean

00:36:51.546 --> 00:36:55.036 A:middle
isTracked, which informs you about

00:36:55.036 --> 00:36:56.466 A:middle
the tracking state of the image.

00:36:56.976 --> 00:36:58.566 A:middle
It's true if it's tracked and

00:36:58.566 --> 00:36:59.246 A:middle
false otherwise.
