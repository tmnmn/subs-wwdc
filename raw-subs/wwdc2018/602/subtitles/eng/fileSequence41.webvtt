[ Applause ]

00:41:02.736 --> 00:41:04.056 A:middle
Can we go to AR 2?

00:41:04.266 --> 00:41:07.346 A:middle
Yes. So for this demo I'd like

00:41:07.416 --> 00:41:10.656 A:middle
to build a AR photo frame, and

00:41:10.656 --> 00:41:12.176 A:middle
for this, I brought a photo of

00:41:12.176 --> 00:41:13.036 A:middle
my cat from home.

00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:15.346 A:middle
So let's build this using Xcode.

00:41:16.256 --> 00:41:19.996 A:middle
So I started by creating a iOS

00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:22.666 A:middle
app template using Xcode.

00:41:23.056 --> 00:41:24.796 A:middle
As you can see by now it's

00:41:24.796 --> 00:41:26.396 A:middle
pretty empty.

00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:28.496 A:middle
Next, I need to specify which

00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:29.736 A:middle
image I'd like to attach.

00:41:30.596 --> 00:41:32.266 A:middle
For this I imported the photo of

00:41:32.266 --> 00:41:33.456 A:middle
my cat, Daisy.

00:41:33.456 --> 00:41:36.436 A:middle
Let's open her up here.

00:41:37.056 --> 00:41:37.606 A:middle
That's my cat.

00:41:37.606 --> 00:41:41.176 A:middle
I need to specify a name.

00:41:41.256 --> 00:41:43.576 A:middle
I give it the name Daisy, which

00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:45.016 A:middle
is the name of my cat, and I

00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:47.816 A:middle
specify here the physical width

00:41:48.176 --> 00:41:49.576 A:middle
of the image found in the real

00:41:49.576 --> 00:41:50.756 A:middle
world, which is my photo frame.

00:41:52.296 --> 00:41:55.156 A:middle
I also loaded a movie of my cat.

00:41:55.956 --> 00:41:56.986 A:middle
So let's bring this all

00:41:56.986 --> 00:41:57.326 A:middle
together.

00:41:58.456 --> 00:42:00.696 A:middle
First, I will create a
