texturing.

00:33:14.866 --> 00:33:17.116 A:middle
It's a powerful new feature in

00:33:17.116 --> 00:33:20.616 A:middle
ARKit 2 that lets you create

00:33:20.616 --> 00:33:22.436 A:middle
your augmented reality scene as

00:33:22.436 --> 00:33:26.256 A:middle

00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:52.446 A:middle
So next let's talk about image

00:33:52.446 --> 00:33:52.816 A:middle
tracking.

00:33:52.816 --> 00:33:56.566 A:middle
In iOS 11.3, we introduced image
