00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:02.146 A:middle
Note that for advanced use

00:30:02.146 --> 00:30:04.496 A:middle
cases, you may want to place

00:30:04.496 --> 00:30:05.666 A:middle
environment probe anchors

00:30:05.876 --> 00:30:11.406 A:middle
manually in the scene.

00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:13.246 A:middle
So for this, you will need to

00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:14.796 A:middle
set environment texturing mode

00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:18.626 A:middle
to manual, and then you can

00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:20.366 A:middle
create environment probe anchors

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:23.066 A:middle
at your desired position and

00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:24.836 A:middle
orientation and add them to AR

00:30:24.836 --> 00:30:25.476 A:middle
session object.

00:30:25.886 --> 00:30:30.306 A:middle
Note that this only enables you

00:30:30.306 --> 00:30:32.936 A:middle
to place the probe anchors in

00:30:33.516 --> 00:30:34.006 A:middle
the scene.

00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:35.666 A:middle
AR session will automatically

00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:37.606 A:middle
update its texture as soon as it

00:30:37.656 --> 00:30:39.596 A:middle
gets more information about the

00:30:39.596 --> 00:30:39.996 A:middle
environment.

00:30:42.016 --> 00:30:45.906 A:middle
So you may use this mode in case

00:30:45.906 --> 00:30:48.306 A:middle
your augmented reality scene has

00:30:48.306 --> 00:30:49.136 A:middle
a single object.

00:30:49.296 --> 00:30:51.176 A:middle
You don't want to overload

00:30:51.576 --> 00:30:53.346 A:middle
system with too many environment

00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:57.046 A:middle
probe anchors.

00:30:57.246 --> 00:30:59.306 A:middle
So let's see a quick demo of

00:30:59.306 --> 00:31:00.926 A:middle
environment texturing and see
