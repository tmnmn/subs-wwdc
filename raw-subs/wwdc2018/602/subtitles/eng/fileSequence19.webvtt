00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:02.036 A:middle
saved a screen shot of my point

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:04.346 A:middle
of view where I saved World Map.

00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:09.696 A:middle
So now we have serialized World

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:11.276 A:middle
Map to our file.

00:19:12.216 --> 00:19:13.986 A:middle
We can now restore the same

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.636 A:middle
augmented reality experience in

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:16.226 A:middle
another app.

00:19:17.096 --> 00:19:18.096 A:middle
So let's try that.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:20.126 A:middle
I will start this app from a

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:24.516 A:middle
different position, and you can

00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:26.806 A:middle
see this is my world origin.

00:19:26.806 --> 00:19:28.526 A:middle
It is defined on this side of

00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:30.606 A:middle
the table, and my world tracking

00:19:30.606 --> 00:19:32.506 A:middle
is now in relocalizing state.

00:19:33.216 --> 00:19:34.526 A:middle
So this is the same opening

00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:36.366 A:middle
relocalization behavior that we

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:40.296 A:middle
introduced in iOS 11.3.

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:44.366 A:middle
So let me point my device to the

00:19:44.446 --> 00:19:46.496 A:middle
physical place where I created

00:19:46.496 --> 00:19:47.526 A:middle
World Map.

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:50.706 A:middle
So as soon as I point to that

00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:53.126 A:middle
same space, it restored my world

00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:57.016 A:middle
origin back to where it was, and

00:19:57.016 --> 00:19:59.306 A:middle
at the same time it also

00:19:59.306 --> 00:20:00.636 A:middle
restored my custom anchor.
