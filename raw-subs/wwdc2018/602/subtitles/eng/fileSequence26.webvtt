00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.696 A:middle
This reflection probe can apply

00:26:01.696 --> 00:26:03.646 A:middle
this as texture information onto

00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:05.426 A:middle
virtual objects, such as the one

00:26:05.426 --> 00:26:06.476 A:middle
we saw in the last slide.

00:26:07.286 --> 00:26:10.146 A:middle
So it greatly improves

00:26:11.326 --> 00:26:13.156 A:middle
visualization of reflective

00:26:13.156 --> 00:26:13.626 A:middle
objects.

00:26:14.936 --> 00:26:16.996 A:middle
So let's see how this works in

00:26:18.136 --> 00:26:20.026 A:middle
this short video clip.

00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:24.796 A:middle
So ARKit, while running world

00:26:24.796 --> 00:26:25.816 A:middle
tracking and scene

00:26:25.816 --> 00:26:27.596 A:middle
understanding, continues to

00:26:27.596 --> 00:26:28.506 A:middle
learn more about the

00:26:28.506 --> 00:26:29.036 A:middle
environment.

00:26:30.226 --> 00:26:32.706 A:middle
Using computer vision, it can

00:26:33.066 --> 00:26:35.676 A:middle
extract textured information and

00:26:35.676 --> 00:26:37.646 A:middle
start to fill this cube map.

00:26:38.136 --> 00:26:41.676 A:middle
And this cube map is accurately

00:26:41.676 --> 00:26:42.636 A:middle
placed in the scene.

00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:46.456 A:middle
Note that this cube map is

00:26:46.456 --> 00:26:50.456 A:middle
partially filled, and to set up

00:26:50.506 --> 00:26:52.186 A:middle
reflection probes, we need to

00:26:52.186 --> 00:26:53.926 A:middle
have a fully completed cube map.

00:26:54.486 --> 00:26:58.756 A:middle
To have a fully completed cube

00:26:58.756 --> 00:27:01.396 A:middle
map, you will need to scan your
