00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.666 A:middle
so let me give you a quick

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.286 A:middle
overview of what ARKit is.

00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:10.376 A:middle
Tracking is the core component

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:10.806 A:middle
of ARKit.

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:12.886 A:middle
It gives you position and

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:14.556 A:middle
orientation of your device in

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:15.326 A:middle
physical world.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:22.216 A:middle
It can also track objects such

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:23.126 A:middle
as human faces.

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:29.046 A:middle
Scene understanding enhances

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:30.066 A:middle
tracking by learning more

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.036 A:middle
attributes about the

00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:31.596 A:middle
environment.

00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:35.666 A:middle
So we can detect horizontal

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:37.976 A:middle
planes such as ground planes or

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:39.006 A:middle
tabletops.

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:41.116 A:middle
We can also detect vertical

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:41.466 A:middle
planes.

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:43.646 A:middle
So this lets you place your

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:45.466 A:middle
virtual objects in the scene.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.576 A:middle
Scene understanding also learns

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:56.096 A:middle
about lighting conditions in the

00:03:56.096 --> 00:03:56.636 A:middle
environment.

00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:00.386 A:middle
So you can use lighting to
