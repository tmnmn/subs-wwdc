00:44:59.636 --> 00:45:01.756 A:middle
using an iOS app running ARKit.

00:45:02.686 --> 00:45:05.016 A:middle
For this we offered the full

00:45:05.016 --> 00:45:06.666 A:middle
source code of a full-featured

00:45:07.036 --> 00:45:09.256 A:middle
iOS app that allows you to scan

00:45:09.256 --> 00:45:10.296 A:middle
your own 3D objects.

00:45:11.436 --> 00:45:13.006 A:middle
Such objects have a few

00:45:13.096 --> 00:45:15.236 A:middle
properties such that they need

00:45:15.236 --> 00:45:17.336 A:middle
to be well textured, rigid, and

00:45:17.376 --> 00:45:18.056 A:middle
nonreflective.

00:45:18.576 --> 00:45:20.396 A:middle
And they need to have roughly

00:45:20.396 --> 00:45:23.866 A:middle
the size of a tabletop.

00:45:23.866 --> 00:45:25.586 A:middle
ARKit can be used to estimate

00:45:25.586 --> 00:45:27.356 A:middle
the position and orientation of

00:45:27.356 --> 00:45:28.796 A:middle
such objects in six degrees of

00:45:28.796 --> 00:45:29.166 A:middle
freedom.

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:33.716 A:middle
And all of this is fully

00:45:33.716 --> 00:45:34.936 A:middle
integrated into world tracking.

00:45:35.396 --> 00:45:37.026 A:middle
So all you need to do is set one

00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:38.726 A:middle
single property to get started

00:45:38.726 --> 00:45:39.526 A:middle
with object detection.

00:45:40.296 --> 00:45:41.976 A:middle
So let's have a look how it can

00:45:41.976 --> 00:45:42.356 A:middle
be set up.

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:45.206 A:middle
I load a set of AR reference

00:45:45.296 --> 00:45:47.486 A:middle
images from file or from Xcode

00:45:47.486 --> 00:45:48.166 A:middle
asset catalog.

00:45:49.066 --> 00:45:50.726 A:middle
I will talk about the reference

00:45:50.726 --> 00:45:51.506 A:middle
objects in a second.

00:45:52.496 --> 00:45:53.586 A:middle
Once I'm done loading these

00:45:53.586 --> 00:45:54.926 A:middle
reference objects, I used them

00:45:55.776 --> 00:45:59.716 A:middle
to set up my configuration of

00:45:59.716 --> 00:46:00.056 A:middle
type
