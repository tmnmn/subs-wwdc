00:22:57.316 --> 00:23:03.046 A:middle
You need to have position and

00:23:03.046 --> 00:23:05.026 A:middle
orientation correct in your AR

00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:08.376 A:middle
scene so that object really

00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:10.716 A:middle
looks like it is placed in the

00:23:10.716 --> 00:23:11.746 A:middle
real world.

00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:15.256 A:middle
It is also important to get the

00:23:15.256 --> 00:23:17.106 A:middle
scale right so your object is

00:23:17.106 --> 00:23:18.666 A:middle
not too big or not too small.

00:23:19.176 --> 00:23:21.236 A:middle
So ARKit helps you by giving you

00:23:21.236 --> 00:23:22.876 A:middle
the correct transform in world

00:23:23.106 --> 00:23:24.606 A:middle
tracking.

00:23:28.456 --> 00:23:30.386 A:middle
For realistic rendering, it is

00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:31.886 A:middle
important to also consider

00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:33.496 A:middle
lighting in the environment.

00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:38.836 A:middle
ARKit gives you ambient light

00:23:38.836 --> 00:23:40.296 A:middle
estimator that you can use in

00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:43.576 A:middle
your rendering to correct the

00:23:43.576 --> 00:23:45.066 A:middle
brightness of your objects.

00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:47.136 A:middle
So your objects don't look too

00:23:47.136 --> 00:23:48.776 A:middle
bright or too dark.

00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:51.746 A:middle
They just blend into the

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:55.056 A:middle
environment.

00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:56.966 A:middle
If you are placing your objects

00:23:56.966 --> 00:23:58.716 A:middle
on physical surfaces such as

00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:01.076 A:middle
horizontal planes, it is also
