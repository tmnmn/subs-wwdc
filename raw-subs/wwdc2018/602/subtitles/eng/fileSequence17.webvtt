[ Applause ]

00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:11.036 A:middle
Okay. So can we switch to AR 1.

00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:15.976 A:middle
Okay. So for this demo, I have

00:17:16.116 --> 00:17:16.955 A:middle
two apps.

00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:20.586 A:middle
In one app I will retrieve and

00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:22.576 A:middle
save World Map to a local file,

00:17:23.366 --> 00:17:26.046 A:middle
and in my second app, I will

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.406 A:middle
load the same World Map to

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:30.096 A:middle
restore the same augmented

00:17:30.096 --> 00:17:31.146 A:middle
reality experience.

00:17:31.626 --> 00:17:32.266 A:middle
So let's start.

00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:36.896 A:middle
So as you can see,

00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:38.886 A:middle
WorldMappingStatus on top right

00:17:38.886 --> 00:17:39.376 A:middle
corner.

00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:41.466 A:middle
It was not available.

00:17:41.826 --> 00:17:43.476 A:middle
As soon as I start to move in

00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:46.416 A:middle
the environment, it is now

00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:47.846 A:middle
extending my World Map.

00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:50.666 A:middle
So if I continue to map and move

00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:53.476 A:middle
in this environment, the

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.336 A:middle
WorldMappingStatus will go

00:17:55.336 --> 00:17:56.016 A:middle
mapped.

00:17:57.206 --> 00:17:58.956 A:middle
So it means that it has seen

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:01.356 A:middle
enough features from this point
