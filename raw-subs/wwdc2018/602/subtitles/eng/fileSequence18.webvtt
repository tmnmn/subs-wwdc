00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:01.356 A:middle
enough features from this point

00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:03.216 A:middle
of view for relocalization to

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:03.446 A:middle
work.

00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:06.406 A:middle
So it is a good time to retrieve

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:08.326 A:middle
and serialize World Map object.

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:12.546 A:middle
But let's make this augmented

00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:14.576 A:middle
reality scene more interesting

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.116 A:middle
by placing a custom anchor.

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:19.466 A:middle
So through hit testing, I have

00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:21.816 A:middle
created a custom anchor, and I

00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:23.926 A:middle
am overlaying this object,

00:18:23.926 --> 00:18:27.266 A:middle
basically it's a old TV.

00:18:27.936 --> 00:18:29.116 A:middle
I think most of you may have

00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:30.586 A:middle
seen in the past.

00:18:33.136 --> 00:18:34.806 A:middle
So of course I can still

00:18:34.806 --> 00:18:38.156 A:middle
continue mapping the world, and

00:18:38.156 --> 00:18:40.276 A:middle
let's save the World Map.

00:18:41.426 --> 00:18:44.246 A:middle
So when I saved my World Map, I

00:18:44.246 --> 00:18:45.916 A:middle
could also show raw feature

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.136 A:middle
points that belongs to this

00:18:47.136 --> 00:18:47.586 A:middle
World Map.

00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:49.416 A:middle
So those blue dots that you see,

00:18:49.756 --> 00:18:52.126 A:middle
they are all part of my World

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:52.866 A:middle
Map.

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:58.926 A:middle
And also as a good practice, I

00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:02.036 A:middle
saved a screen shot of my point
