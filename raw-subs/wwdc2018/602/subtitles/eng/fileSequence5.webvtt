00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.416 A:middle
So let's see, what is new this

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:02.316 A:middle
year in ARKit 2.

00:05:07.836 --> 00:05:09.436 A:middle
Okay. So we have saving and

00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:11.566 A:middle
loading maps that enables

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.156 A:middle
powerful new features of

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:15.426 A:middle
persistence and multiuser

00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:16.206 A:middle
experiences.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:21.026 A:middle
We are also giving you

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:22.906 A:middle
environment texturing so you can

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.246 A:middle
realistically render your

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:25.526 A:middle
augmented reality scene.

00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:30.376 A:middle
ARKit can now track 2D images in

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:31.516 A:middle
real-time.

00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:34.836 A:middle
We are not limited to 2D.

00:05:35.076 --> 00:05:37.466 A:middle
We can also detect 3D objects in

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.316 A:middle
a scene.

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:43.146 A:middle
And last, we have some fun

00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:44.756 A:middle
enhancements for face tracking.

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:50.136 A:middle
So let's start with saving and

00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:51.696 A:middle
loading maps.

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.616 A:middle
Saving and loading maps is part

00:05:58.616 --> 00:05:59.656 A:middle
of world tracking.
