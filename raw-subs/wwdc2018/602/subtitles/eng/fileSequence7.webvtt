00:06:56.996 --> 00:07:00.236 A:middle
the scene.

00:07:00.446 --> 00:07:02.886 A:middle
In iOS 11.3, we introduced

00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:03.876 A:middle
relocalization.

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:07.226 A:middle
This feature lets you restore

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.816 A:middle
your tracking state after AR

00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:11.436 A:middle
session was interrupted.

00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:13.806 A:middle
So this could happen, for

00:07:13.806 --> 00:07:14.766 A:middle
example, your app is

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:17.186 A:middle
backgrounded or you're using

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:23.886 A:middle
picture in picture mode on iPad.

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:29.326 A:middle
So relocalization works with a

00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:32.086 A:middle
map that is continuously built

00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:32.966 A:middle
by world tracking.

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.966 A:middle
So the more we move around the

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:39.566 A:middle
environment, the more it is able

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:41.116 A:middle
to extend and learn about

00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:42.126 A:middle
different features of the

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:43.216 A:middle
environment.

00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:51.536 A:middle
So this map was only available

00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:53.336 A:middle
as long as your AR session was

00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:56.306 A:middle
alive, but not we are giving

00:07:56.306 --> 00:08:00.026 A:middle
this map available to you.
