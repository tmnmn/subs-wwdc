00:45:59.716 --> 00:46:00.056 A:middle
type

00:46:00.226 --> 00:46:02.096 A:middle
ARWorldTrackingConfiguration by

00:46:02.096 --> 00:46:03.776 A:middle
specifying the detection objects

00:46:03.806 --> 00:46:04.196 A:middle
property.

00:46:04.706 --> 00:46:07.166 A:middle
When I'm done setting up my

00:46:07.236 --> 00:46:09.706 A:middle
configuration, again I run my

00:46:09.786 --> 00:46:10.346 A:middle
session with it.

00:46:11.406 --> 00:46:12.696 A:middle
And just as image detection,

00:46:13.326 --> 00:46:14.466 A:middle
once the AR session is running,

00:46:14.466 --> 00:46:15.496 A:middle
I get an ARFrame with every

00:46:15.496 --> 00:46:18.936 A:middle
update, and in this case, once

00:46:18.936 --> 00:46:20.386 A:middle
an object has been detected in

00:46:20.386 --> 00:46:22.606 A:middle
the scene, I will find an AR

00:46:23.106 --> 00:46:25.966 A:middle
object anchor as part of my AR

00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:26.336 A:middle
frame.

00:46:28.926 --> 00:46:30.866 A:middle
Such an AR object is a simple

00:46:30.866 --> 00:46:32.506 A:middle
subclass of AR anchor.

00:46:33.156 --> 00:46:34.336 A:middle
So it comes with a transform,

00:46:34.336 --> 00:46:35.606 A:middle
which represents its position

00:46:35.796 --> 00:46:37.016 A:middle
and orientation and six degrees

00:46:37.016 --> 00:46:39.656 A:middle
of freedom as well as it tells

00:46:39.656 --> 00:46:41.706 A:middle
me which objects has been

00:46:41.706 --> 00:46:43.056 A:middle
detected by giving me a

00:46:43.056 --> 00:46:44.296 A:middle
reference to the AR reference

00:46:44.296 --> 00:46:44.676 A:middle
object.

00:46:46.326 --> 00:46:49.596 A:middle
And implementing this can be

00:46:49.596 --> 00:46:51.866 A:middle
done with three simple lines of

00:46:51.936 --> 00:46:52.186 A:middle
code.

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.286 A:middle
I create a configuration of type

00:46:54.486 --> 00:46:56.876 A:middle
ARWorldTrackingConfiguration and

00:46:56.876 --> 00:46:59.116 A:middle
specify a set of objects I'd

00:46:59.116 --> 00:46:59.756 A:middle
like to detect.
