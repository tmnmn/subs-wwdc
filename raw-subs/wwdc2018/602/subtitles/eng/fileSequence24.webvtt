00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:01.076 A:middle
horizontal planes, it is also

00:24:01.076 --> 00:24:03.416 A:middle
important to add a shadow for

00:24:03.416 --> 00:24:03.866 A:middle
the object.

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:06.916 A:middle
So this greatly improves human

00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:07.776 A:middle
visual perception.

00:24:08.036 --> 00:24:09.106 A:middle
They can really perceive that

00:24:09.106 --> 00:24:13.256 A:middle
objection is on the surface.

00:24:13.426 --> 00:24:16.876 A:middle
And last, in case of reflective

00:24:16.876 --> 00:24:20.156 A:middle
objects, humans wants to see

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:22.576 A:middle
reflection of the environment

00:24:22.716 --> 00:24:24.376 A:middle
from the surface of the virtual

00:24:24.376 --> 00:24:24.696 A:middle
objects.

00:24:25.886 --> 00:24:28.166 A:middle
So this is what environment

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:28.946 A:middle
texturing enables.

00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:32.496 A:middle
So let's see how this object

00:24:32.496 --> 00:24:34.866 A:middle
looks like in an augmented

00:24:34.866 --> 00:24:37.976 A:middle
reality scene.

00:24:38.196 --> 00:24:39.426 A:middle
So I created this scene

00:24:39.426 --> 00:24:41.076 A:middle
yesterday evening when I was

00:24:41.156 --> 00:24:42.696 A:middle
preparing for this presentation.

00:24:43.246 --> 00:24:47.186 A:middle
So while eating those fruits, I

00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:48.346 A:middle
also wanted to place this

00:24:48.346 --> 00:24:49.606 A:middle
virtual object.

00:24:49.606 --> 00:24:54.886 A:middle
And you can see, it is correct

00:24:54.996 --> 00:24:57.486 A:middle
to scale, and you can see more

00:24:57.486 --> 00:24:59.356 A:middle
importantly you can see a

00:24:59.356 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
reflection of the environment in
