00:12:59.116 --> 00:13:03.146 A:middle
So once you have ARWorldMap, you

00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:08.946 A:middle
can simply set initial World Map

00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:10.686 A:middle
property in world tracking

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:13.596 A:middle
configuration and run your

00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:13.966 A:middle
session.

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:17.356 A:middle
Note that this can be

00:13:17.356 --> 00:13:18.976 A:middle
dynamically changed as well, so

00:13:18.976 --> 00:13:20.646 A:middle
you can also reconfigure AR

00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:22.466 A:middle
session by running a new

00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:23.046 A:middle
configuration.

00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:27.606 A:middle
So once AR session is started

00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:31.266 A:middle
with ARWorldMap, it will follow

00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:33.086 A:middle
the exact same behavior of

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:34.526 A:middle
relocalization that we

00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:36.976 A:middle
introduced in iOS 11.3.

00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:46.276 A:middle
It is important for your

00:13:46.906 --> 00:13:49.946 A:middle
experience that relocalization

00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:50.836 A:middle
works reliably.

00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:54.076 A:middle
So it is good to, it is

00:13:54.076 --> 00:13:55.296 A:middle
important to acquire good World

00:13:55.296 --> 00:13:55.626 A:middle
Maps.

00:13:56.406 --> 00:13:57.996 A:middle
Note that you can call get a

00:13:57.996 --> 00:13:59.906 A:middle
current world map at any point
