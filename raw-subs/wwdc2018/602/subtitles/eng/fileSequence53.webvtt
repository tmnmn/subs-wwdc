00:52:59.106 --> 00:53:00.426 A:middle
expressions in real-time.

00:53:01.176 --> 00:53:02.436 A:middle
These expressions are so-called

00:53:02.806 --> 00:53:05.236 A:middle
blend shapes, and there's 50 or

00:53:05.306 --> 00:53:06.616 A:middle
more of them.

00:53:08.186 --> 00:53:09.296 A:middle
Such a blend shape assume a

00:53:09.296 --> 00:53:10.516 A:middle
value between 0 and 1.

00:53:11.236 --> 00:53:12.356 A:middle
One means there's full

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:13.116 A:middle
activation.

00:53:13.116 --> 00:53:13.856 A:middle
Zero means there is none.

00:53:14.386 --> 00:53:15.666 A:middle
For example, the jaw

00:53:15.666 --> 00:53:17.836 A:middle
open coefficient will assume a

00:53:17.836 --> 00:53:19.156 A:middle
value close to 1 if I open my

00:53:19.156 --> 00:53:20.796 A:middle
mouth and a value close to 0 if

00:53:20.796 --> 00:53:21.236 A:middle
I close it.

00:53:22.106 --> 00:53:24.456 A:middle
And this is great to animate

00:53:24.456 --> 00:53:25.416 A:middle
your own virtual character.

00:53:26.186 --> 00:53:27.706 A:middle
This example here, I've used the

00:53:27.706 --> 00:53:29.466 A:middle
jaw open and eye blink left and

00:53:29.466 --> 00:53:31.236 A:middle
eye blink right to animate this

00:53:31.236 --> 00:53:32.276 A:middle
really simple box face

00:53:32.276 --> 00:53:32.616 A:middle
character.

00:53:34.156 --> 00:53:35.276 A:middle
But it can do better than that.

00:53:36.286 --> 00:53:38.156 A:middle
In fact, when we built Animoji,

00:53:38.156 --> 00:53:39.856 A:middle
we used a handful more of such

00:53:39.856 --> 00:53:40.406 A:middle
blend shapes.

00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:42.256 A:middle
So all the blue bars you see

00:53:42.256 --> 00:53:44.446 A:middle
moving here were used to get

00:53:44.446 --> 00:53:46.106 A:middle
over the head post to map my

00:53:46.106 --> 00:53:47.856 A:middle
facial expressions on the panda

00:53:47.856 --> 00:53:48.076 A:middle
bear.

00:53:49.706 --> 00:53:50.986 A:middle
Note that ARKit offers

00:53:51.056 --> 00:53:52.616 A:middle
everything needed for you to

00:53:52.616 --> 00:53:54.896 A:middle
animate your own character just

00:53:54.896 --> 00:53:56.086 A:middle
like we did with Animoji.

00:53:56.696 --> 00:53:58.036 A:middle
Thank you.

00:53:59.516 --> 00:54:04.276 A:middle
