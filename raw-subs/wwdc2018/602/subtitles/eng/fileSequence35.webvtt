00:34:59.636 --> 00:35:01.546 A:middle
to image detection with a big

00:35:01.546 --> 00:35:03.776 A:middle
advantage that images no longer

00:35:03.776 --> 00:35:07.406 A:middle
need to be static and may move.

00:35:07.616 --> 00:35:09.036 A:middle
ARKit will now estimate the

00:35:09.036 --> 00:35:10.806 A:middle
position and orientation for

00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:12.516 A:middle
every frame at 60 frames per

00:35:12.516 --> 00:35:12.886 A:middle
second.

00:35:13.706 --> 00:35:15.206 A:middle
This allows you to accurately

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:18.316 A:middle
augment 2D images, say

00:35:18.906 --> 00:35:20.626 A:middle
magazines, board games, or

00:35:20.626 --> 00:35:21.856 A:middle
pretty much anything that

00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:23.396 A:middle
features a real image.

00:35:24.986 --> 00:35:27.136 A:middle
And ARKit can also track

00:35:27.516 --> 00:35:29.066 A:middle
multiple images simultaneously.

00:35:30.886 --> 00:35:32.356 A:middle
By default it only selects 1,

00:35:32.646 --> 00:35:34.596 A:middle
but in cases, for example, the

00:35:34.596 --> 00:35:36.166 A:middle
cover of a magazine, you may

00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:39.156 A:middle
want to keep this set to 1, or

00:35:39.156 --> 00:35:41.046 A:middle
in case of a double-page

00:35:41.046 --> 00:35:42.866 A:middle
magazine inside a magazine, you

00:35:42.866 --> 00:35:43.716 A:middle
want to set this to 2.

00:35:45.416 --> 00:35:49.496 A:middle
And in ARKit 2 on iOS 12, we

00:35:49.736 --> 00:35:51.086 A:middle
have a brand-new configuration

00:35:51.086 --> 00:35:52.556 A:middle
called the AR Image Tracking

00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:54.626 A:middle
Configuration that lets you do

00:35:55.076 --> 00:35:56.546 A:middle
stand-alone image tracking.

00:35:57.356 --> 00:35:58.596 A:middle
So let's see how to set it up.
