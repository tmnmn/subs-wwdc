00:49:00.186 --> 00:49:01.356 A:middle
So let's have a look how this

00:49:01.396 --> 00:49:02.066 A:middle
app works.

00:49:02.756 --> 00:49:04.396 A:middle
I start by creating a bounding

00:49:04.396 --> 00:49:05.786 A:middle
box around the object of

00:49:05.786 --> 00:49:07.136 A:middle
interest, in this case, the

00:49:07.136 --> 00:49:07.976 A:middle
statue of Nefertiti.

00:49:07.976 --> 00:49:10.486 A:middle
Note that the bounding box does

00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:11.856 A:middle
not need to be really strict

00:49:11.856 --> 00:49:12.616 A:middle
around the object.

00:49:12.896 --> 00:49:14.806 A:middle
All we care is that the most

00:49:14.806 --> 00:49:16.626 A:middle
important feature points are

00:49:16.766 --> 00:49:17.716 A:middle
within its bounds.

00:49:19.226 --> 00:49:20.166 A:middle
When I'm satisfied with the

00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:23.366 A:middle
bounding box, I can click press

00:49:23.516 --> 00:49:26.056 A:middle
scan, and we start scanning the

00:49:26.056 --> 00:49:26.416 A:middle
object.

00:49:27.106 --> 00:49:28.326 A:middle
I can see the progress going up

00:49:28.326 --> 00:49:30.216 A:middle
and this tile representation

00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:32.446 A:middle
indicating how much of the

00:49:32.446 --> 00:49:33.976 A:middle
object has been scanned in a

00:49:33.976 --> 00:49:34.736 A:middle
spatial manner.

00:49:35.946 --> 00:49:37.066 A:middle
Note that you do not have to

00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:38.566 A:middle
scan the object from all sides.

00:49:39.546 --> 00:49:41.336 A:middle
For example, if you know that a

00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:43.496 A:middle
statue will be facing a wall in

00:49:43.496 --> 00:49:46.426 A:middle
a museum, and there is no way

00:49:46.426 --> 00:49:47.626 A:middle
that you could detect it from

00:49:47.626 --> 00:49:49.546 A:middle
one specific viewpoint, you do

00:49:49.546 --> 00:49:51.626 A:middle
not need to scan it from that

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:52.756 A:middle
side.

00:49:53.426 --> 00:49:55.156 A:middle
Once you're satisfied with the

00:49:55.226 --> 00:50:00.126 A:middle
scan, you can adjust the center
