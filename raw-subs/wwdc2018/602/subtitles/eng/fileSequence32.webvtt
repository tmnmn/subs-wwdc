00:31:59.686 --> 00:32:01.536 A:middle
But what we are missing is that

00:32:01.536 --> 00:32:03.776 A:middle
it does not reflect wooden

00:32:03.776 --> 00:32:06.786 A:middle
surface of the table.

00:32:06.916 --> 00:32:08.286 A:middle
So moreover, if I place

00:32:08.286 --> 00:32:11.526 A:middle
something in the scene such as

00:32:11.526 --> 00:32:17.516 A:middle
real fruit, we don't see a

00:32:17.516 --> 00:32:20.516 A:middle
reflection of it in the virtual

00:32:20.936 --> 00:32:21.126 A:middle
object.

00:32:21.656 --> 00:32:23.616 A:middle
So let's enable environment

00:32:23.616 --> 00:32:25.896 A:middle
texturing and see how it can

00:32:26.206 --> 00:32:29.156 A:middle
realistically represent this

00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:29.576 A:middle
texture.

00:32:30.636 --> 00:32:32.326 A:middle
So as you can see, as soon as I

00:32:32.326 --> 00:32:33.766 A:middle
enable environment texturing,

00:32:34.526 --> 00:32:36.366 A:middle
the object started to reflect

00:32:36.366 --> 00:32:38.616 A:middle
the wooden surface of the table

00:32:39.016 --> 00:32:41.686 A:middle
as well as the texture from this

00:32:41.746 --> 00:32:42.176 A:middle
banana.

00:32:43.516 --> 00:32:50.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:52.626 --> 00:32:55.326 A:middle
So this greatly enhances you

00:32:55.326 --> 00:32:56.706 A:middle
augmented reality scene.

00:32:57.346 --> 00:32:59.586 A:middle
So it looks as real as possible,
