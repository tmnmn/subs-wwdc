00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:03.766 A:middle
One user can create World Map

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:05.986 A:middle
and share with one or more

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:06.716 A:middle
users.

00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:10.866 A:middle
Note that World Map represents a

00:11:10.916 --> 00:11:13.876 A:middle
single coordinate system in real

00:11:13.876 --> 00:11:14.176 A:middle
world.

00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:17.226 A:middle
So what it means that every user

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:18.946 A:middle
will share the same working

00:11:19.006 --> 00:11:19.356 A:middle
space.

00:11:20.426 --> 00:11:22.326 A:middle
They are able to experience the

00:11:22.396 --> 00:11:23.506 A:middle
same augmented reality

00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:25.416 A:middle
experience from different point

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:27.436 A:middle
of view.

00:11:27.676 --> 00:11:29.106 A:middle
So this is a great new feature.

00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:33.346 A:middle
You can use World Map to enable

00:11:33.346 --> 00:11:36.476 A:middle
multiuser games, such as the one

00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:37.406 A:middle
we saw yesterday.

00:11:37.976 --> 00:11:42.756 A:middle
We can also use ARWorldMap to

00:11:42.756 --> 00:11:44.426 A:middle
create multiuser shared

00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:45.626 A:middle
educational experiences.

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:51.536 A:middle
Note that we are giving

00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:53.366 A:middle
ARWorldMap object in your hands,

00:11:53.906 --> 00:11:55.856 A:middle
so you are free to choose any

00:11:56.636 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
technology to share with every
