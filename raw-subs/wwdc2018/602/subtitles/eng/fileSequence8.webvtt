00:07:56.306 --> 00:08:00.026 A:middle
this map available to you.

00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:03.066 A:middle
In ARKit API, this map is given

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.396 A:middle
to you as ARWorldMap object.

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:16.406 A:middle
ARWorldMap represents mapping of

00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:19.346 A:middle
physical 3D space, similar to

00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:22.036 A:middle
what we see in this, on the

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:25.676 A:middle
visual, on the right.

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.436 A:middle
We also know that anchors are

00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:29.046 A:middle
important points in physical

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:29.376 A:middle
space.

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:31.286 A:middle
So these are the places where

00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:33.306 A:middle
you want to place your virtual

00:08:33.306 --> 00:08:33.666 A:middle
objects.

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:36.535 A:middle
So we have also included plain

00:08:36.535 --> 00:08:38.566 A:middle
anchors by default in

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:39.746 A:middle
ARWorldMap.

00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:42.895 A:middle
Moreover, you can also add your

00:08:42.895 --> 00:08:44.646 A:middle
custom anchors to this list

00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:46.546 A:middle
since it is mutable list.

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:48.866 A:middle
So you can create your custom

00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:50.016 A:middle
anchors in the scene and add

00:08:50.016 --> 00:08:51.726 A:middle
them to World Map.

00:08:57.546 --> 00:08:59.236 A:middle
For your visualization and

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:01.776 A:middle
debugging, World Map also give
