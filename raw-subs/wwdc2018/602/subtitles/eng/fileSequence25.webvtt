00:24:59.356 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
reflection of the environment in

00:25:01.476 --> 00:25:02.336 A:middle
the object.

00:25:02.496 --> 00:25:04.326 A:middle
On your right side of this

00:25:04.326 --> 00:25:06.766 A:middle
object, you can see this yellow

00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:09.376 A:middle
and orange reflection of those

00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:11.386 A:middle
fruits on the right, and on the

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:13.646 A:middle
left, you can notice the green

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:14.596 A:middle
texture from the leaves.

00:25:15.906 --> 00:25:17.196 A:middle
And in the middle, you can also

00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:19.336 A:middle
see reflection of the surface of

00:25:20.136 --> 00:25:21.386 A:middle
the bench.

00:25:21.616 --> 00:25:23.286 A:middle
So this is enabled by

00:25:23.286 --> 00:25:25.366 A:middle
environment texturing in ARKit

00:25:25.906 --> 00:25:25.976 A:middle
2.

00:25:29.336 --> 00:25:29.606 A:middle
Thank you.

00:25:30.476 --> 00:25:33.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:34.136 --> 00:25:35.826 A:middle
So environment texturing gathers

00:25:35.906 --> 00:25:37.456 A:middle
scene texture information.

00:25:40.616 --> 00:25:43.176 A:middle
Usually it is represented as a

00:25:43.176 --> 00:25:44.666 A:middle
cube map, but there are other

00:25:44.666 --> 00:25:48.956 A:middle
representations as well.

00:25:49.036 --> 00:25:51.426 A:middle
Environment texture or this cube

00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:53.746 A:middle
map can be used as a reflection

00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:56.146 A:middle
probe in your rendering engines.

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.696 A:middle
This reflection probe can apply
