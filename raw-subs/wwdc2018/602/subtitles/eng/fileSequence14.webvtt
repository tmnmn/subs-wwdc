00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:02.526 A:middle
in time.

00:14:02.526 --> 00:14:04.976 A:middle
So, it's important to scan your

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.626 A:middle
physical space from multiple

00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:09.226 A:middle
point of views.

00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:11.266 A:middle
So tracking system can really

00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:12.516 A:middle
learn about physical structure

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:13.316 A:middle
of the environment.

00:14:14.956 --> 00:14:17.996 A:middle
The environment should be static

00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:19.976 A:middle
and well textured so we can

00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:22.326 A:middle
learn, extract more features of

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:23.936 A:middle
it and learn more about the

00:14:23.936 --> 00:14:24.376 A:middle
environment.

00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:30.116 A:middle
And also, it's important to have

00:14:30.116 --> 00:14:31.986 A:middle
dense feature points on the map,

00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:34.936 A:middle
so it can reliably relocalize.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.716 A:middle
But you don't have to worry

00:14:38.716 --> 00:14:40.256 A:middle
about all those points.

00:14:41.676 --> 00:14:43.916 A:middle
In ARKit, API really makes

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:46.076 A:middle
things easier for you by giving

00:14:46.076 --> 00:14:47.776 A:middle
you WorldMappingStatus on

00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:48.186 A:middle
ARFrame.

00:14:49.366 --> 00:14:51.516 A:middle
WorldMappingStatus is updated in

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.856 A:middle
every ARFrame and can be

00:14:53.856 --> 00:14:55.776 A:middle
retrieved by WorldMappingStatus

00:14:55.956 --> 00:14:56.376 A:middle
property.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.456 A:middle
So let's see how this works.

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:02.866 A:middle
So when we start world tracking,
