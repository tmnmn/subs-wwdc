00:42:57.686 --> 00:43:00.616 A:middle
image anchor, and I create an

00:43:00.716 --> 00:43:02.296 A:middle
SCN plane having the same

00:43:02.366 --> 00:43:04.106 A:middle
physical dimension as the image

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:04.876 A:middle
found in the scene.

00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:08.136 A:middle
I assign the video player as the

00:43:08.176 --> 00:43:10.796 A:middle
texture to my plane, and I start

00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:11.766 A:middle
playing my video player.

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:15.446 A:middle
I create an SCN note from

00:43:15.446 --> 00:43:17.356 A:middle
geometry, and I counter rotate

00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:20.646 A:middle
to match the anchor's coordinate

00:43:20.866 --> 00:43:21.116 A:middle
system.

00:43:21.906 --> 00:43:22.896 A:middle
So that's it.

00:43:22.896 --> 00:43:24.026 A:middle
This will run.

00:43:24.446 --> 00:43:26.086 A:middle
Let's see it live.

00:43:27.716 --> 00:43:32.086 A:middle
So once I bring the frame of my

00:43:32.086 --> 00:43:33.936 A:middle
cat into the camera's view, the

00:43:34.146 --> 00:43:36.036 A:middle
video starts playing, and I can

00:43:36.096 --> 00:43:37.126 A:middle
see my cat interact.

00:43:37.676 --> 00:43:43.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:44.446 --> 00:43:46.516 A:middle
Since ARKit estimates position

00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:48.186 A:middle
in real-time, I can move my

00:43:48.186 --> 00:43:50.156 A:middle
device freely, or I can move the

00:43:50.156 --> 00:43:50.616 A:middle
object.

00:43:50.616 --> 00:43:52.546 A:middle
So I can really see that there's

00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:54.056 A:middle
an update at every frame.

00:43:54.056 --> 00:43:56.626 A:middle
Oh, oh, she just left.

00:43:56.966 --> 00:43:59.176 A:middle
I guess it's the end of the

00:43:59.176 --> 00:44:00.316 A:middle
demo, let's go back to the
