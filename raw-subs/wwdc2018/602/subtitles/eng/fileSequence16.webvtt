00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.346 A:middle
with another user, and you have

00:16:02.346 --> 00:16:04.906 A:middle
a shared map button on your user

00:16:04.906 --> 00:16:05.356 A:middle
interface.

00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:09.096 A:middle
It's a good practice to disable

00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:10.046 A:middle
this button when

00:16:10.046 --> 00:16:11.146 A:middle
WorldMappingStatus is not

00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:12.576 A:middle
available or limited.

00:16:13.096 --> 00:16:16.166 A:middle
And when WorldMappingStatus is

00:16:16.196 --> 00:16:19.386 A:middle
extending, you may want to show

00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:21.446 A:middle
an activity indicator on UI.

00:16:22.046 --> 00:16:23.936 A:middle
So this encourages your end user

00:16:24.426 --> 00:16:25.786 A:middle
to continue moving in the

00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:27.476 A:middle
physical world and continue

00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:29.526 A:middle
scanning it and extending the

00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:31.446 A:middle
map, because you need that for

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:32.146 A:middle
relocalization.

00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.416 A:middle
Once WorldMappingStatus is fully

00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:42.476 A:middle
mapped, you may enable your

00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:44.346 A:middle
share map button and hide your

00:16:44.466 --> 00:16:45.366 A:middle
activity indicator.

00:16:46.096 --> 00:16:47.886 A:middle
So this will let your user to

00:16:47.886 --> 00:16:49.046 A:middle
share the map.

00:16:53.716 --> 00:16:55.676 A:middle
So let's see a demo of saving

00:16:55.676 --> 00:16:57.146 A:middle
and loading World Map.

00:16:58.516 --> 00:17:06.546 A:middle
