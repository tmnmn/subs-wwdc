00:41:58.456 --> 00:42:00.696 A:middle
First, I will create a

00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:03.176 A:middle
configuration, which will be a

00:42:03.176 --> 00:42:04.166 A:middle
configuration of type

00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:06.406 A:middle
ARImageTrackingConfiguration.

00:42:07.426 --> 00:42:08.976 A:middle
I load a set of tracking images

00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:11.426 A:middle
from the asset catalog by using

00:42:11.556 --> 00:42:13.176 A:middle
the group name photos.

00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:15.086 A:middle
This will contain only one

00:42:15.086 --> 00:42:17.146 A:middle
image, which is the photo of my

00:42:17.146 --> 00:42:17.736 A:middle
cat, Daisy.

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:22.066 A:middle
Next, I set up the configuration

00:42:22.066 --> 00:42:23.616 A:middle
image tracking by specifying the

00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:25.486 A:middle
tracking images property here,

00:42:26.236 --> 00:42:28.106 A:middle
and I specify the max number of

00:42:28.156 --> 00:42:30.066 A:middle
tracked images that we want.

00:42:30.446 --> 00:42:31.556 A:middle
At this point, the app will

00:42:31.556 --> 00:42:34.126 A:middle
already start an AR session and

00:42:34.126 --> 00:42:35.356 A:middle
provide you with image anchors

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:36.596 A:middle
once an image has been detected.

00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:38.106 A:middle
But let's add some content.

00:42:38.936 --> 00:42:40.716 A:middle
I will load the video

00:42:41.916 --> 00:42:45.586 A:middle
by trading a AV player from the

00:42:46.106 --> 00:42:47.046 A:middle
video by loading it from the

00:42:47.046 --> 00:42:47.656 A:middle
resource panel.

00:42:49.136 --> 00:42:51.016 A:middle
Now let's add it on top of the

00:42:51.016 --> 00:42:52.016 A:middle
real image.

00:42:52.586 --> 00:42:56.296 A:middle
So for this, I'm checking

00:42:56.296 --> 00:42:57.636 A:middle
whether the anchor is of type

00:42:57.686 --> 00:43:00.616 A:middle
image anchor, and I create an
