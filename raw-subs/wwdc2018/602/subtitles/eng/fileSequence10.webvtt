00:09:56.646 --> 00:10:00.956 A:middle
And before leaves the scene, he

00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:03.896 A:middle
will save World Map on the

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:04.686 A:middle
device.

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:12.066 A:middle
So some point, sometime later,

00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:15.866 A:middle
the user comes back, and he is

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:17.846 A:middle
able to load the same World Map,

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:20.686 A:middle
and he will find the same

00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:22.086 A:middle
augmented reality experience.

00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:24.616 A:middle
So he can repeat this experience

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:26.946 A:middle
as many times he wants, and he

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.546 A:middle
will find these objects on the

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.386 A:middle
table every time he will start

00:10:30.386 --> 00:10:31.006 A:middle
his experience.

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:34.376 A:middle
So this is persistence in world

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:34.716 A:middle
tracking

00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:37.626 A:middle
[applause].

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:37.956 A:middle
Thank you.

00:10:38.508 --> 00:10:40.508 A:middle
[applause]

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:45.946 A:middle
ARWorldMap also enables

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:47.506 A:middle
multiuser experiences.

00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:51.016 A:middle
Now your augmented reality

00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:52.236 A:middle
experience is not limited to a

00:10:52.306 --> 00:10:53.616 A:middle
single device or single user.

00:10:54.936 --> 00:10:56.956 A:middle
It can be shared with many

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:57.426 A:middle
users.

00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:03.766 A:middle
One user can create World Map
