00:47:58.506 --> 00:48:00.736 A:middle
plane estimation in which we use

00:48:00.776 --> 00:48:02.186 A:middle
accumulated scene information to

00:48:02.516 --> 00:48:03.566 A:middle
estimate the position of a

00:48:03.566 --> 00:48:05.106 A:middle
horizontal or vertical plane.

00:48:06.046 --> 00:48:07.556 A:middle
In this case, we use this

00:48:08.326 --> 00:48:11.606 A:middle
information to gather

00:48:11.606 --> 00:48:13.286 A:middle
information about the 3D object.

00:48:13.776 --> 00:48:17.556 A:middle
In order to specify which area

00:48:17.556 --> 00:48:19.086 A:middle
to look for the object, I just

00:48:19.086 --> 00:48:21.326 A:middle
specify a transform and extend

00:48:21.366 --> 00:48:21.986 A:middle
in the center.

00:48:22.796 --> 00:48:24.036 A:middle
This is essentially a bounding

00:48:24.036 --> 00:48:25.746 A:middle
box around the object just to

00:48:25.846 --> 00:48:29.696 A:middle
define where it is in the scene.

00:48:29.876 --> 00:48:31.266 A:middle
Extracted objects are fully

00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:33.126 A:middle
supported by Xcode's asset

00:48:33.126 --> 00:48:34.736 A:middle
catalog, so it makes it really

00:48:34.736 --> 00:48:38.486 A:middle
easy to port them to a new app

00:48:38.556 --> 00:48:40.756 A:middle
and reuse them as many times as

00:48:40.756 --> 00:48:41.116 A:middle
you want.

00:48:42.606 --> 00:48:43.986 A:middle
And for scanning, we added a new

00:48:43.986 --> 00:48:45.266 A:middle
configuration, the

00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:46.696 A:middle
ARObjectScanningConfiguration.

00:48:48.156 --> 00:48:49.896 A:middle
But you do not need to go ahead

00:48:49.896 --> 00:48:51.246 A:middle
and implement your own scanning

00:48:51.246 --> 00:48:53.826 A:middle
app as the full sample code is

00:48:53.826 --> 00:48:55.386 A:middle
available for full-featured

00:48:55.486 --> 00:48:57.616 A:middle
scanning app called Scanning and

00:48:57.616 --> 00:48:58.746 A:middle
Detecting 3D Objects.
