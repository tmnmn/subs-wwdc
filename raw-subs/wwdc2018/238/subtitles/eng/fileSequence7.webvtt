00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.366 A:middle
For more information, please

00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:02.736 A:middle
look at our talk, Advances in

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:05.116 A:middle
TVMLKit from last year's WWDC.

00:07:08.246 --> 00:07:10.706 A:middle
This year, we've extended that

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:11.436 A:middle
vocabulary.

00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:13.366 A:middle
To begin, we've added a more

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.896 A:middle
generic way of binding child

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:17.076 A:middle
elements of an element using the

00:07:17.076 --> 00:07:17.876 A:middle
children binding.

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.986 A:middle
And to help better organize your

00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:22.526 A:middle
DOM, we've added a couple of

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:24.186 A:middle
special elements, namely

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:25.276 A:middle
fragment and rules.

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:27.446 A:middle
We'll go into this in detail,

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.076 A:middle
starting with children binding.

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:33.526 A:middle
Children binding is a more

00:07:33.526 --> 00:07:35.106 A:middle
generic form of items binding.

00:07:35.996 --> 00:07:37.966 A:middle
Items binding is optimized for

00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:39.936 A:middle
use cases where you have a

00:07:39.936 --> 00:07:42.046 A:middle
section of a shelf, grid, or

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:44.316 A:middle
list in order to work

00:07:44.316 --> 00:07:45.486 A:middle
efficiently with large data

00:07:45.486 --> 00:07:45.836 A:middle
sets.

00:07:46.826 --> 00:07:48.146 A:middle
They can be used outside these

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:48.706 A:middle
elements.

00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.046 A:middle
For everything else, use

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:51.766 A:middle
children's binding.

00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:55.436 A:middle
And it's because of a very

00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:56.136 A:middle
simple reason.

00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:57.976 A:middle
It works by generating children

00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.736 A:middle
of a target element itself.
