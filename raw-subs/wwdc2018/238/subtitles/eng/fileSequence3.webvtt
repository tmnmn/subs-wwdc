If your elementary is collapsed,

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.156 A:middle
Web Inspector will expand it to

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:06.876 A:middle
the exact element and highlight

00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:07.016 A:middle
it.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.966 A:middle
To use Web Inspector, either

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.636 A:middle
download the latest version of

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:15.616 A:middle
macOS and install it, or use

00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:16.966 A:middle
Safari technology preview.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.176 A:middle
More information about how to

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:21.406 A:middle
use Web Inspector can be seen in

00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:23.296 A:middle
our talk given last year using

00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:24.876 A:middle
Web Inspector with tvOS apps.

00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:30.256 A:middle
With that, let's talk about data

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:30.636 A:middle
binding.

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:35.176 A:middle
And before we jump into the new

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:36.646 A:middle
features of data binding itself,

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:37.976 A:middle
let me give you an overview of

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:38.566 A:middle
what it is.

00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:40.576 A:middle
Data binding helps you easily

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:42.746 A:middle
transform your data to user

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:44.346 A:middle
interface elements through

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:45.766 A:middle
expressions in your template

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:46.166 A:middle
markup.

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:48.876 A:middle
This is really good because it

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:50.706 A:middle
allows you to decouple your data

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.066 A:middle
and your lot -- and your layout

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.796 A:middle
logic as well as your

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:55.116 A:middle
application logic itself.

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:58.776 A:middle
Because of this, data bound

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:00.126 A:middle
templates can reduce the amount
