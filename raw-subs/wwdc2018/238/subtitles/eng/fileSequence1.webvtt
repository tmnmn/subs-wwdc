00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:01.996 A:middle
familiar with and use today are

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.216 A:middle
built using TVMLKit.

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:04.976 A:middle
Along with that, there are

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:06.336 A:middle
thousands more in the app store

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:07.046 A:middle
that you write.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.706 A:middle
So let's get started with the

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:12.006 A:middle
enhancements we've made to

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.046 A:middle
TVMLKit, beginning with three

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.336 A:middle
things we want to talk about

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:15.606 A:middle
today.

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:18.176 A:middle
First, we have some enhancements

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:20.006 A:middle
to Web Inspector that allow you

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:21.186 A:middle
to further debug your

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.816 A:middle
applications and introspect them

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.446 A:middle
at a deeper level.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:27.476 A:middle
Since last year, we've added a

00:01:27.476 --> 00:01:28.716 A:middle
bunch of features and

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:29.986 A:middle
enhancements to the framework

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:31.306 A:middle
and I'm going to discuss three

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:32.676 A:middle
of them with you today.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.936 A:middle
We're going to talk about new

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:37.006 A:middle
Web Inspector enhancements for

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.506 A:middle
better debugging, new data

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:41.176 A:middle
binding constructs that are

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:42.416 A:middle
added to make it more powerful,

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:44.436 A:middle
and finally, a new way to

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:45.716 A:middle
customize the playback

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:47.196 A:middle
experience on TVMLKit.

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:49.956 A:middle
Let's get started with Web

00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:50.446 A:middle
Inspector.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:53.156 A:middle
tvOS 11 introduced more support

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:54.466 A:middle
for Web Inspector that allow

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.156 A:middle
better introspection into your

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:57.236 A:middle
TVMLKit apps.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.506 A:middle
Since then, we've enhanced this

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:01.976 A:middle
support even further.
