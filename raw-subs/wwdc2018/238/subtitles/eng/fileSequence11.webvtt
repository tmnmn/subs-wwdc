00:10:58.496 --> 00:11:00.376 A:middle
is another likely scenario where

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:02.406 A:middle
you have data that some do not

00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:04.196 A:middle
change, and some change all the

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:04.516 A:middle
time.

00:11:05.606 --> 00:11:07.296 A:middle
For example in this particular

00:11:07.296 --> 00:11:10.186 A:middle
piece of data itself, it is for

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:12.366 A:middle
a video that has a poster image,

00:11:12.496 --> 00:11:14.906 A:middle
a title, and a playback

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:15.496 A:middle
progress.

00:11:17.726 --> 00:11:19.316 A:middle
In some situations, we want to

00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:21.236 A:middle
show different user interfaces

00:11:21.236 --> 00:11:22.356 A:middle
based on that information

00:11:22.356 --> 00:11:22.716 A:middle
itself.

00:11:23.176 --> 00:11:25.576 A:middle
In the case where playback

00:11:25.576 --> 00:11:27.596 A:middle
progress hasn't started, it's

00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:29.796 A:middle
naturally zero and we are

00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:31.596 A:middle
interested in showing the poster

00:11:31.596 --> 00:11:33.836 A:middle
image and the title for the

00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:34.576 A:middle
video itself.

00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:37.766 A:middle
But when we start watching the

00:11:37.766 --> 00:11:39.326 A:middle
video, progress will naturally

00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:40.226 A:middle
be greater than zero.

00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:42.256 A:middle
For that, we want to show the

00:11:42.256 --> 00:11:43.606 A:middle
same thing that never change,

00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:45.836 A:middle
the poster image and its title.

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:48.586 A:middle
However to make things obvious

00:11:48.586 --> 00:11:50.736 A:middle
this video's being played back,

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:52.626 A:middle
we want to show a progress bar

00:11:52.626 --> 00:11:53.506 A:middle
that's filled through the

00:11:53.506 --> 00:11:55.216 A:middle
playback progress' percentage

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:55.646 A:middle
itself.

00:11:57.546 --> 00:11:58.886 A:middle
In the very same vein, we have

00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:00.526 A:middle
now two use cases where data is
