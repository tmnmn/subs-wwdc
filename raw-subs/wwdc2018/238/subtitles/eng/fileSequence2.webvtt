00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:01.976 A:middle
support even further.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.596 A:middle
In tvOS 11.3, in addition to

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:06.996 A:middle
showing install event listeners

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:08.616 A:middle
on an element, you can now

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:09.886 A:middle
temporarily disable them.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.166 A:middle
This vastly helps with debugging

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.456 A:middle
as you can now toggle the event

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.166 A:middle
handlers off and on at whim.

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:22.476 A:middle
In the network tab, joining at

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.516 A:middle
[inaudible] in document

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:25.416 A:middle
resources are image resources.

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:27.206 A:middle
This allows you to see the

00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:29.336 A:middle
images that are being loaded as

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:30.576 A:middle
well as information about how

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:32.116 A:middle
long it took and where time was

00:02:32.116 --> 00:02:32.436 A:middle
spent.

00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:35.806 A:middle
If you are interested in seeing

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.076 A:middle
the actual image that comes off

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:38.646 A:middle
the wire, this is now also an

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:39.676 A:middle
option you have at your

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:40.236 A:middle
disposal.

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:42.206 A:middle
However, please note that this

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:43.386 A:middle
only works after you've

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:45.206 A:middle
connected the Web Inspector.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.026 A:middle
It does not show what has

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:47.876 A:middle
already been loaded.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.496 A:middle
Finally, my most favorite

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:53.086 A:middle
feature of all, the inspect

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:53.396 A:middle
button.

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:55.596 A:middle
Clicking this will show you the

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:56.916 A:middle
approximately element that

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.026 A:middle
represents the view that's

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.186 A:middle
currently in focus.
