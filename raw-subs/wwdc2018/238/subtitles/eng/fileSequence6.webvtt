00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:00.486 A:middle
data of what it should actually

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:01.126 A:middle
be filled with.

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:04.646 A:middle
The data bound template

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:05.976 A:middle
representation for this title

00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:07.386 A:middle
element will contain a text

00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:09.216 A:middle
content binding and the property

00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:09.836 A:middle
it maps to.

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:14.386 A:middle
Finally let's talk a little bit

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:15.376 A:middle
about items binding.

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:17.356 A:middle
It is a slightly different

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:19.256 A:middle
binding and involves a group of

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:20.886 A:middle
data pieces you want to show.

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.156 A:middle
It also only works with sections

00:06:23.156 --> 00:06:24.696 A:middle
on a shelf, list, or grid.

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:27.796 A:middle
In this example, we have some

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.146 A:middle
data with the tree list items as

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:30.736 A:middle
an array.

00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:32.636 A:middle
And the final representation

00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:34.836 A:middle
should be a section of tree list

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:35.656 A:middle
item lockups.

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:38.416 A:middle
The corresponding data bound

00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:39.586 A:middle
template for this section will

00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:41.696 A:middle
contain two things; an item's

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:43.366 A:middle
binding and the property it maps

00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:46.336 A:middle
to, and also a prototype to

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.016 A:middle
convert each data object

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:49.006 A:middle
contained in the array.

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:51.296 A:middle
In this case, it would be a data

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:52.826 A:middle
bound template representation of

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:53.836 A:middle
a list item lockup.

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:57.236 A:middle
So that's the tree binding

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:58.666 A:middle
constructs we've introduced in

00:06:58.666 --> 00:06:59.556 A:middle
tvOS 11.
