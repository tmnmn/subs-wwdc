00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:00.526 A:middle
now two use cases where data is

00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:02.556 A:middle
different and we also want to

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.016 A:middle
show two different looks of what

00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:04.416 A:middle
it is.

00:12:05.146 --> 00:12:06.756 A:middle
In the first case, we -- all we

00:12:06.756 --> 00:12:08.366 A:middle
have is an image and a title in

00:12:08.366 --> 00:12:08.816 A:middle
the lock up.

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:11.556 A:middle
And in the second case, we have

00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:13.256 A:middle
the addition of an overlay and a

00:12:13.256 --> 00:12:13.896 A:middle
progress bar.

00:12:17.046 --> 00:12:17.916 A:middle
Typically you would have

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:19.456 A:middle
application logic that outputs

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:21.126 A:middle
different x amount based on that

00:12:21.126 --> 00:12:24.016 A:middle
data itself but with rules, you

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:25.356 A:middle
can have a single statically

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:27.076 A:middle
defined template that would give

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:28.606 A:middle
you either representations of

00:12:28.636 --> 00:12:29.526 A:middle
the final document.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.096 A:middle
So what are the rules?

00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:35.236 A:middle
Well, rules used data states to

00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:38.186 A:middle
redefine your final document

00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:40.166 A:middle
which, in turns, refines your

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:40.756 A:middle
UI.

00:12:41.806 --> 00:12:43.296 A:middle
It is an invisible element.

00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:44.746 A:middle
So the renderer doesn't see it

00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:46.736 A:middle
but it affects how the document

00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:47.236 A:middle
is authored.

00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:50.716 A:middle
Any operations within those

00:12:50.716 --> 00:12:53.616 A:middle
rules happen on sibling elements

00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:55.476 A:middle
that the rules are a part of.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:57.756 A:middle
And the best way to show this to

00:12:57.756 --> 00:12:59.396 A:middle
you is in another example of how

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:00.286 A:middle
this can be setup.
