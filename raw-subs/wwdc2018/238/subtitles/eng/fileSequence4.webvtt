00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:00.126 A:middle
templates can reduce the amount

00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:01.366 A:middle
of JavaScript code you actually

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
have to write to convert your

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.556 A:middle
data to TVML documents, since

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.116 A:middle
the framework does this on your

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:07.016 A:middle
behalf.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
In fact, by authoring your

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.646 A:middle
documents on your behalf, it is

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:11.716 A:middle
able to do it in the most

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:13.236 A:middle
performing way so you don't have

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:14.666 A:middle
to worry about the right APIs to

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:15.076 A:middle
use.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.926 A:middle
Let's look at a practical

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:19.266 A:middle
example to explain this.

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.026 A:middle
Say you want to generate a

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:22.936 A:middle
banner with a title and a

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:23.596 A:middle
description.

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:25.316 A:middle
And this is how you would

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:26.706 A:middle
typically do it without data

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.546 A:middle
binding itself.

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.386 A:middle
First, you will fetch the

00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:33.666 A:middle
relevant data that's supposed to

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.146 A:middle
be shown to the user in this

00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:36.856 A:middle
case, a title and a description.

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:40.596 A:middle
And upon fetching, you pass it

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:42.406 A:middle
onto a part of the JavaScript

00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:43.666 A:middle
code you've already written that

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:45.126 A:middle
processes this data and

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:46.786 A:middle
generates the actual final

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:47.766 A:middle
document itself.

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:52.336 A:middle
Now, with data bindings, you can

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:53.666 A:middle
take out JavaScript processing

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.526 A:middle
step and provide binding

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:57.206 A:middle
specifications in your template

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.956 A:middle
itself, and TVMLKit will

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:00.556 A:middle
populate the final document on
