00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:00.336 A:middle
to TVPlayer that is responsible

00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:01.806 A:middle
for playing media in that view.

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:05.476 A:middle
With everything, there are

00:18:05.476 --> 00:18:07.226 A:middle
several caveats to using

00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:10.086 A:middle
TVPlayer and its associated user

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:10.596 A:middle
interface.

00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:13.246 A:middle
The very first thing is you

00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:14.476 A:middle
should handle any 'should'

00:18:14.476 --> 00:18:15.266 A:middle
events yourself.

00:18:16.026 --> 00:18:17.156 A:middle
These are usually tied to

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:19.246 A:middle
interstitials and since that's

00:18:19.246 --> 00:18:20.786 A:middle
largely user interface, this

00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:22.656 A:middle
should be handled by the native

00:18:22.656 --> 00:18:23.446 A:middle
code that you write.

00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:27.266 A:middle
If you use FairPlay encryption

00:18:27.266 --> 00:18:29.836 A:middle
for your video playback, you

00:18:29.836 --> 00:18:32.456 A:middle
need to use AVContentKeySession

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:33.486 A:middle
for secure key loading.

00:18:34.006 --> 00:18:36.326 A:middle
For more information about

00:18:36.326 --> 00:18:38.406 A:middle
AVContentKeySession, look at our

00:18:38.406 --> 00:18:39.866 A:middle
talks from last year, Advances

00:18:39.866 --> 00:18:42.166 A:middle
in HTTP Live Streaming, and a

00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:43.086 A:middle
talk from this year about

00:18:43.086 --> 00:18:44.646 A:middle
AVContentKeySession Best

00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:45.206 A:middle
Practices.

00:18:47.456 --> 00:18:49.826 A:middle
Finally, if your JavaScript

00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:51.586 A:middle
developers use overlay and

00:18:51.586 --> 00:18:53.526 A:middle
interactive overlays, this will

00:18:53.526 --> 00:18:54.856 A:middle
not work out of the box.

00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.896 A:middle
They are user interfaces and

00:18:56.896 --> 00:18:57.856 A:middle
because you are building your

00:18:57.856 --> 00:18:59.396 A:middle
own, you will have to handle it

00:18:59.446 --> 00:18:59.896 A:middle
yourself.
