00:16:01.156 --> 00:16:03.016 A:middle
These have close analogues to

00:16:03.016 --> 00:16:04.486 A:middle
our JavaScript APIs.

00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:06.256 A:middle
So that would be less confusion

00:16:06.406 --> 00:16:07.696 A:middle
in talking to your JavaScript

00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:08.276 A:middle
developers.

00:16:09.556 --> 00:16:11.856 A:middle
And finally there's a limited

00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:13.066 A:middle
JavaScript Bridge that's

00:16:13.066 --> 00:16:13.736 A:middle
exposed.

00:16:13.736 --> 00:16:15.206 A:middle
It allows communications between

00:16:15.336 --> 00:16:17.456 A:middle
your native code and JavaScript

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:17.866 A:middle
itself.

00:16:20.536 --> 00:16:23.916 A:middle
Let's talk about TVPlayer and

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.736 A:middle
that's the base where you can

00:16:25.736 --> 00:16:26.926 A:middle
get your customized playback

00:16:26.926 --> 00:16:27.766 A:middle
experience working.

00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:32.466 A:middle
TVPlayer is a public AVPlayer

00:16:32.466 --> 00:16:33.886 A:middle
adaptor to the Playback

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:34.336 A:middle
Pipeline.

00:16:35.396 --> 00:16:36.916 A:middle
What this means is that TVPlayer

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.506 A:middle
effectively translates regular

00:16:38.506 --> 00:16:40.506 A:middle
AVPlayer callbacks into what

00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:41.746 A:middle
JavaScript expects.

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:47.306 A:middle
TVPlayer is also the object that

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:48.726 A:middle
you can use to dispatch custom

00:16:48.726 --> 00:16:51.276 A:middle
events to JavaScript and by

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.526 A:middle
default, it already handles

00:16:52.576 --> 00:16:54.806 A:middle
everything that AVPlayer has as

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:55.536 A:middle
playback events.

00:16:55.656 --> 00:16:57.586 A:middle
So anything extra is on you to

00:16:57.586 --> 00:16:57.976 A:middle
dispatch.
