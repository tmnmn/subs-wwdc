00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:00.286 A:middle
this can be setup.

00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:04.286 A:middle
So let's look at the rules that

00:13:04.476 --> 00:13:06.756 A:middle
we would use to structure the

00:13:06.756 --> 00:13:08.106 A:middle
very prototype that we want --

00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:10.036 A:middle
that we've shown as an example.

00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:11.976 A:middle
We will start by defining the

00:13:11.976 --> 00:13:13.386 A:middle
prototype as the lowest common

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:15.116 A:middle
denominator of what our user

00:13:15.116 --> 00:13:16.446 A:middle
interface should look like.

00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:18.916 A:middle
And in this case, we have an

00:13:18.916 --> 00:13:20.016 A:middle
image and a title.

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:23.196 A:middle
However, you would notice that

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.216 A:middle
we also have a place holder for

00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:25.896 A:middle
the progress bar.

00:13:26.566 --> 00:13:28.056 A:middle
Placeholders are also special

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:29.426 A:middle
elements that are invisible to

00:13:29.426 --> 00:13:31.096 A:middle
the renderer and in this case,

00:13:31.366 --> 00:13:32.876 A:middle
would be used by the rules as a

00:13:32.876 --> 00:13:34.686 A:middle
target for replacement when data

00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:35.426 A:middle
states match.

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:39.026 A:middle
Now let's fill in our rules.

00:13:40.136 --> 00:13:41.466 A:middle
A group of rules that act on

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:42.466 A:middle
sibling elements are

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:43.976 A:middle
encapsulated in the rules tag.

00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:48.926 A:middle
Individual rules that match a

00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:51.426 A:middle
data state are encapsulated as

00:13:51.516 --> 00:13:54.186 A:middle
specialized elements, and

00:13:54.606 --> 00:13:56.776 A:middle
specialized elements become

00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:58.576 A:middle
active when it matches certain

00:13:58.576 --> 00:13:59.166 A:middle
data states.
