00:34:59.876 --> 00:35:01.206 A:middle
that I'd like to talk about is a

00:35:01.206 --> 00:35:03.176 A:middle
new method for modifying the

00:35:03.256 --> 00:35:03.486 A:middle
text,

00:35:04.176 --> 00:35:05.686 A:middle
PerformValidatedReplacement.

00:35:06.276 --> 00:35:07.916 A:middle
The idea behind this method is

00:35:07.966 --> 00:35:09.186 A:middle
that it gives you a very easy

00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:10.866 A:middle
way to manipulate the text in

00:35:10.866 --> 00:35:12.936 A:middle
the textView, and it gives you

00:35:12.936 --> 00:35:14.516 A:middle
behavior as if the user had

00:35:14.516 --> 00:35:15.876 A:middle
performed the change themselves.

00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:17.936 A:middle
So, it performs all the

00:35:17.936 --> 00:35:19.656 A:middle
appropriate delegate methods, as

00:35:19.656 --> 00:35:20.286 A:middle
you'd expect.

00:35:20.696 --> 00:35:21.936 A:middle
But, the really interesting part

00:35:21.936 --> 00:35:23.716 A:middle
is that any attributes that are

00:35:23.716 --> 00:35:25.336 A:middle
not specified on the input

00:35:25.336 --> 00:35:27.196 A:middle
string are automatically filled

00:35:27.196 --> 00:35:28.506 A:middle
in using the textView's

00:35:28.616 --> 00:35:29.296 A:middle
typingAttributes.

00:35:30.466 --> 00:35:31.976 A:middle
So, let me give you an example.

00:35:32.506 --> 00:35:33.856 A:middle
Here's a window with some rich

00:35:33.856 --> 00:35:35.216 A:middle
text in it, and a little snippet

00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:36.196 A:middle
of code that calls

00:35:36.266 --> 00:35:38.346 A:middle
performValidatedReplacement to

00:35:38.346 --> 00:35:39.886 A:middle
insert the word "Developers" in

00:35:39.886 --> 00:35:40.196 A:middle
the middle.

00:35:41.266 --> 00:35:42.996 A:middle
If we run this, this is what we

00:35:42.996 --> 00:35:43.256 A:middle
get.

00:35:43.256 --> 00:35:45.226 A:middle
The word appears and it matches

00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:46.346 A:middle
the style of the surrounding

00:35:46.406 --> 00:35:48.126 A:middle
text, and we didn't have to

00:35:48.126 --> 00:35:49.436 A:middle
specify any attributes.

00:35:50.246 --> 00:35:51.896 A:middle
There's a subtlety here to be

00:35:51.896 --> 00:35:52.576 A:middle
aware of, though.

00:35:52.646 --> 00:35:55.236 A:middle
And, that's because the fallback

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:56.376 A:middle
attributes come from the

00:35:56.446 --> 00:35:57.316 A:middle
typingAttributes.

00:35:57.426 --> 00:35:59.226 A:middle
So, if you start with some rich

00:35:59.336 --> 00:36:00.436 A:middle
text like this, and the
