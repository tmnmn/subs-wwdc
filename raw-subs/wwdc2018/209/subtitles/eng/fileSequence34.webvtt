00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:00.776 A:middle
Here's a sample window that

00:34:00.776 --> 00:34:01.616 A:middle
shows all four.

00:34:02.236 --> 00:34:03.226 A:middle
TextViews are sometimes

00:34:03.226 --> 00:34:04.916 A:middle
misconfigured when clients need

00:34:04.916 --> 00:34:06.506 A:middle
to override the fieldEditor in a

00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:07.066 A:middle
textField.

00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:08.766 A:middle
And so, using a fieldEditor

00:34:08.766 --> 00:34:10.186 A:middle
factory method can help avoid

00:34:10.186 --> 00:34:10.856 A:middle
problems there.

00:34:11.815 --> 00:34:13.636 A:middle
The next one, scrollableTextView

00:34:14.346 --> 00:34:15.716 A:middle
should be used for textViews

00:34:15.815 --> 00:34:17.946 A:middle
that are for auxiliary text in

00:34:17.946 --> 00:34:19.726 A:middle
popovers and inspector panes.

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:20.386 A:middle
Things like that.

00:34:20.386 --> 00:34:22.376 A:middle
And then, the bottom two are for

00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:23.876 A:middle
text that's main document

00:34:23.876 --> 00:34:24.266 A:middle
content.

00:34:24.456 --> 00:34:25.996 A:middle
The one on the left is for rich

00:34:25.996 --> 00:34:27.376 A:middle
text; the one on the right is

00:34:27.376 --> 00:34:28.025 A:middle
for plain text.

00:34:28.846 --> 00:34:29.846 A:middle
You might be wondering at this

00:34:29.926 --> 00:34:31.466 A:middle
point what the distinction is,

00:34:31.516 --> 00:34:32.666 A:middle
because they all look fairly

00:34:32.706 --> 00:34:33.106 A:middle
similar.

00:34:33.596 --> 00:34:34.696 A:middle
The main benefit is that you

00:34:34.696 --> 00:34:35.775 A:middle
don't need to worry about the

00:34:35.775 --> 00:34:36.755 A:middle
system configuration.

00:34:37.496 --> 00:34:38.936 A:middle
For example, if the system's in

00:34:38.936 --> 00:34:40.565 A:middle
Dark Mode, they begin to look

00:34:40.565 --> 00:34:41.326 A:middle
more distinct.

00:34:42.266 --> 00:34:44.746 A:middle
The rich text's textView retains

00:34:44.746 --> 00:34:46.045 A:middle
its white background, and the

00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:47.926 A:middle
plain text turns dark to match

00:34:48.016 --> 00:34:48.996 A:middle
the rest of the system for

00:34:48.996 --> 00:34:49.406 A:middle
example.

00:34:50.106 --> 00:34:51.396 A:middle
So, in general if you use these

00:34:51.396 --> 00:34:52.815 A:middle
factory methods, it'll help keep

00:34:52.815 --> 00:34:54.366 A:middle
your application consistent with

00:34:54.366 --> 00:34:55.775 A:middle
the specifications for the rest

00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:56.255 A:middle
of the system.

00:34:58.696 --> 00:34:59.876 A:middle
The other change to textView

00:34:59.876 --> 00:35:01.206 A:middle
that I'd like to talk about is a
