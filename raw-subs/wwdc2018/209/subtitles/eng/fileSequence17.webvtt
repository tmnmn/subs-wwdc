00:16:59.516 --> 00:17:00.706 A:middle
gorgeous sand dunes, and there's

00:17:00.706 --> 00:17:02.326 A:middle
a lot of blues and light and

00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:03.156 A:middle
dark grays in there.

00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:04.715 A:middle
And, if we do the masked pick,

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:05.876 A:middle
an average color for this

00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:07.546 A:middle
rectangle, we wind up with this

00:17:07.546 --> 00:17:09.276 A:middle
nice dark blue color instead.

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:11.626 A:middle
So, when we construct our UI and

00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:12.955 A:middle
add back in this gray color,

00:17:13.136 --> 00:17:14.156 A:middle
it's not solid gray.

00:17:14.425 --> 00:17:15.506 A:middle
We're keeping that dark blue

00:17:15.506 --> 00:17:16.256 A:middle
color with us.

00:17:16.526 --> 00:17:18.086 A:middle
And, this permeates even when we

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:19.526 A:middle
add back the individual controls

00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:20.036 A:middle
in the window.

00:17:20.036 --> 00:17:20.935 A:middle
They all have this nice

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.136 A:middle
character from the desktop

00:17:22.136 --> 00:17:22.465 A:middle
picture.

00:17:23.425 --> 00:17:24.746 A:middle
So, let me show you what this

00:17:24.746 --> 00:17:25.506 A:middle
looks like with a different

00:17:25.506 --> 00:17:26.986 A:middle
desktop picture, in this case, a

00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:27.425 A:middle
flower.

00:17:28.036 --> 00:17:29.866 A:middle
You can see we have these much

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.646 A:middle
brighter purples and greens in

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:32.606 A:middle
this desktop picture.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:33.906 A:middle
And, that affects the system

00:17:33.906 --> 00:17:34.886 A:middle
preferences window here.

00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:36.556 A:middle
Likewise, if we used a red

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.106 A:middle
flower instead, you can really

00:17:38.106 --> 00:17:39.546 A:middle
see in this case, how the System

00:17:39.546 --> 00:17:41.286 A:middle
Preferences window is taking

00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:42.826 A:middle
that wonderful warm character

00:17:42.826 --> 00:17:44.196 A:middle
from the desktop picture and

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.536 A:middle
propagating it to all of the UI

00:17:45.626 --> 00:17:46.126 A:middle
elements.

00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:49.506 A:middle
So, a really common thing you

00:17:49.506 --> 00:17:50.786 A:middle
might be wondering with this is,

00:17:50.786 --> 00:17:52.176 A:middle
that sounds like a lot of work

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.736 A:middle
to dynamically figure out where

00:17:53.736 --> 00:17:55.276 A:middle
a window is, what the average

00:17:55.276 --> 00:17:57.206 A:middle
color is, and you know, update

00:17:57.206 --> 00:17:57.646 A:middle
it live.

00:17:57.986 --> 00:17:59.626 A:middle
So, my first advice to you is

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.536 A:middle
don't be daunted by this task.
