00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:01.846 A:middle
You can select these controls,

00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:03.766 A:middle
and embed them in a grid view.

00:32:03.766 --> 00:32:05.216 A:middle
And, once you've done that, you

00:32:05.216 --> 00:32:06.486 A:middle
can go through and adjust the

00:32:06.486 --> 00:32:07.826 A:middle
padding and the alignment of the

00:32:07.946 --> 00:32:09.586 A:middle
cells in order to achieve the

00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:10.646 A:middle
layout that you want.

00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:13.756 A:middle
The editing UI works a lot like

00:32:13.756 --> 00:32:14.916 A:middle
the numbered spreadsheet app.

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:16.896 A:middle
So, you can drag and drop views

00:32:16.896 --> 00:32:17.596 A:middle
into cells.

00:32:17.706 --> 00:32:19.356 A:middle
You can select cells in rows and

00:32:19.356 --> 00:32:21.016 A:middle
columns, and adjust their

00:32:21.016 --> 00:32:21.586 A:middle
properties.

00:32:22.426 --> 00:32:23.836 A:middle
You can even merge cells, as you

00:32:23.836 --> 00:32:25.436 A:middle
see in the bottom two rows here.

00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:28.376 A:middle
Here's an example where we

00:32:28.456 --> 00:32:29.236 A:middle
select a column.

00:32:29.786 --> 00:32:31.466 A:middle
And, this is what the inspector

00:32:31.466 --> 00:32:32.866 A:middle
pane looks like, so you can see

00:32:32.866 --> 00:32:34.366 A:middle
you can adjust the placement of

00:32:34.366 --> 00:32:35.706 A:middle
the cells in that column.

00:32:36.066 --> 00:32:37.156 A:middle
You can adjust the leading and

00:32:37.186 --> 00:32:37.936 A:middle
trailing padding.

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:39.546 A:middle
If we switch over to the Size

00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:41.336 A:middle
Inspector, you can specify an

00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:42.976 A:middle
explicit width for the column.

00:32:42.976 --> 00:32:44.206 A:middle
Or, if you don't do that, then

00:32:44.206 --> 00:32:45.216 A:middle
the column will be sized

00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:46.526 A:middle
automatically based on the

00:32:46.526 --> 00:32:46.946 A:middle
content.

00:32:49.036 --> 00:32:50.106 A:middle
And, one of the other really

00:32:50.106 --> 00:32:51.816 A:middle
nice things about this feature

00:32:52.606 --> 00:32:53.136 A:middle
is that it's

00:32:53.186 --> 00:32:54.216 A:middle
backwards-deployable.

00:32:54.426 --> 00:32:56.216 A:middle
GridViews authored in Interface

00:32:56.216 --> 00:32:58.456 A:middle
Builder can be used back to

00:32:58.456 --> 00:33:01.686 A:middle
macOS 10.13.4, or if you're not
