00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:05.126 A:middle
So, programmatically one of the

00:24:05.126 --> 00:24:06.776 A:middle
changes you no longer have to

00:24:06.776 --> 00:24:08.726 A:middle
care about here is that you

00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:09.946 A:middle
don't have to explicitly set

00:24:09.946 --> 00:24:11.436 A:middle
.wantsLayer on your views to use

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:12.206 A:middle
layers anymore.

00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:13.386 A:middle
AppKit will take care of this

00:24:13.386 --> 00:24:14.846 A:middle
for you when you're deploying

00:24:14.846 --> 00:24:16.506 A:middle
against macOS 10.14.

00:24:16.936 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
If you're deploying against--

00:24:20.516 --> 00:24:24.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:25.066 --> 00:24:27.576 A:middle
In fact, we generally encourage

00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:28.986 A:middle
you not to even use this

00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:30.596 A:middle
property, because if you set it

00:24:30.596 --> 00:24:32.056 A:middle
explicitly to true, we're going

00:24:32.056 --> 00:24:33.146 A:middle
to make sure your view gets its

00:24:33.146 --> 00:24:34.326 A:middle
own layer, and we're not going

00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:35.666 A:middle
to do the optimizations we can

00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:37.306 A:middle
do, where we render multiple

00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:38.476 A:middle
views into a single layer.

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:40.406 A:middle
You might also need to still use

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:41.176 A:middle
this if you're deploying to

00:24:41.176 --> 00:24:42.956 A:middle
earlier OS's, but usually you

00:24:42.956 --> 00:24:44.136 A:middle
can still get away with ignoring

00:24:45.446 --> 00:24:45.516 A:middle
it.

00:24:45.846 --> 00:24:46.826 A:middle
I wanted to talk about some

00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:48.546 A:middle
other patterns you might have in

00:24:48.636 --> 00:24:50.256 A:middle
NSView UI's you are making that

00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:51.076 A:middle
use CALayers.

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.206 A:middle
So, one of the easiest ways to

00:24:53.206 --> 00:24:54.606 A:middle
draw a CALayer, is to just

00:24:54.606 --> 00:24:56.006 A:middle
override the draw method in the

00:24:56.006 --> 00:24:56.776 A:middle
CALayer class.

00:24:57.196 --> 00:24:58.916 A:middle
Or, implement a delegate method.

00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:00.966 A:middle
And, this is mostly fine, but
