00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
This has been available in iOS

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:02.806 A:middle
for some time now, and with

00:29:02.806 --> 00:29:04.846 A:middle
macOS Mojave, we're bringing it

00:29:04.846 --> 00:29:05.316 A:middle
to the Mac.

00:29:07.646 --> 00:29:09.546 A:middle
This allows for better control

00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:10.676 A:middle
of user notifications.

00:29:11.226 --> 00:29:12.126 A:middle
And, it also means that your

00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:13.246 A:middle
apps can interact with them the

00:29:13.296 --> 00:29:14.986 A:middle
same way that they do on iOS.

00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:17.576 A:middle
They should do that using the

00:29:17.576 --> 00:29:18.666 A:middle
NSApplication method,

00:29:18.886 --> 00:29:20.486 A:middle
registerForRemoteNotifications,

00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:21.976 A:middle
as well as the

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:24.296 A:middle
requestAuthorization method on

00:29:24.476 --> 00:29:25.536 A:middle
userNotificationCenter.

00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:28.676 A:middle
As a part of this work, we're

00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:30.406 A:middle
also deprecating some existing

00:29:30.806 --> 00:29:32.786 A:middle
user notification-related API's.

00:29:32.826 --> 00:29:34.956 A:middle
Specifically, in NSApplication,

00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:36.126 A:middle
we're deprecating the

00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:37.296 A:middle
remoteNotificationType

00:29:37.386 --> 00:29:39.416 A:middle
OptionSet, as well as the

00:29:39.656 --> 00:29:41.276 A:middle
registerForRemoteNotifications

00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:41.776 A:middle
method and the

00:29:41.776 --> 00:29:43.566 A:middle
enabledRemoteNotificationTypes

00:29:44.186 --> 00:29:44.576 A:middle
property.

00:29:45.326 --> 00:29:46.686 A:middle
We're also deprecating all of

00:29:46.686 --> 00:29:47.846 A:middle
NSUserNotification.

00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:50.716 A:middle
So, as you rebuild with the new

00:29:50.876 --> 00:29:52.866 A:middle
SDK, you should try to update to

00:29:52.866 --> 00:29:53.846 A:middle
the user notifications

00:29:53.846 --> 00:29:54.256 A:middle
framework.

00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:57.796 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk a little

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.356 A:middle
bit about NSToolbar.
