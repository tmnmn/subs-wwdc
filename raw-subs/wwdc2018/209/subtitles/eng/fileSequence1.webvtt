00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:01.986 A:middle
Now, as you know, we pride

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:04.105 A:middle
ourselves on our API's, and our

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:05.876 A:middle
goal always, is to have API's

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:07.446 A:middle
that are capable, and

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:08.686 A:middle
consistent, and powerful.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:10.756 A:middle
So, with that in mind, we

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:12.806 A:middle
continue to do refinements that

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.516 A:middle
improve both the Objective-C and

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:16.086 A:middle
Swift exposure of our API's.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:18.436 A:middle
And, this is not just in AppKit

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:20.306 A:middle
or Foundation, but also other

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:21.906 A:middle
frameworks including UIKit, as

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.166 A:middle
you might have heard in this

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.596 A:middle
morning's "What's New in Cocoa

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:24.966 A:middle
Touch."

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:28.236 A:middle
Now, the API changes we're doing

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:30.586 A:middle
are fully source compatible in

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:32.646 A:middle
Objective-C, and we also expect

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:34.466 A:middle
them to be 100% migratable in

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.846 A:middle
Swift by the time we GM the SDK.

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:38.756 A:middle
So, with that, let's look at

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:39.906 A:middle
some of the API refinements

00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:40.886 A:middle
within this release.

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:44.226 A:middle
First I'm going to talk about

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:47.036 A:middle
some updates to string types.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:49.486 A:middle
Last release, we introduced

00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:51.016 A:middle
string enumeration types as a

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:52.476 A:middle
way to collect groups of related

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:53.616 A:middle
string constants together.

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:55.696 A:middle
These helped make API's that

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:56.876 A:middle
deal in these types much

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:57.236 A:middle
clearer.

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:00.116 A:middle
And, here are some examples.
