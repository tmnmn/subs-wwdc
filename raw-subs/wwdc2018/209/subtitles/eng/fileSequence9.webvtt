00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:01.386 A:middle
And, the version number for the

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:02.846 A:middle
deprecation is API TO BE

00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:03.416 A:middle
DEPRECATED.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:07.386 A:middle
So, what this does is, it tells

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:09.186 A:middle
the compiler not to generate a

00:09:09.186 --> 00:09:10.706 A:middle
deprecation warning or an error,

00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:12.906 A:middle
however our intent is that if

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:14.396 A:middle
you try to use the symbol in

00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:16.516 A:middle
Xcode, or new code, or in access

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:18.026 A:middle
documentation, you will get a

00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:19.216 A:middle
warning that the symbol is

00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:20.216 A:middle
deprecated, and it will be

00:09:20.216 --> 00:09:21.356 A:middle
pointed at the replacement

00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:21.736 A:middle
symbol.

00:09:22.336 --> 00:09:23.546 A:middle
So, of course, comes across in

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:24.466 A:middle
Swift as well.

00:09:24.556 --> 00:09:26.856 A:middle
As you can see here, one thing

00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:28.126 A:middle
to note, the version number

00:09:28.156 --> 00:09:29.016 A:middle
100,000.

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:30.996 A:middle
This is not a pre-announcement,

00:09:30.996 --> 00:09:32.676 A:middle
or a leak of some far, future

00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:32.956 A:middle
SDK.

00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:34.996 A:middle
It's just that's a placeholder

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:36.526 A:middle
number we're using for now to

00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:39.036 A:middle
indicate this feature.

00:09:40.196 --> 00:09:41.206 A:middle
Now, we use formal soft

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.126 A:middle
deprecation in a few other

00:09:42.126 --> 00:09:42.806 A:middle
cases.

00:09:43.826 --> 00:09:45.286 A:middle
Earlier I showed you this.

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:47.436 A:middle
And, I told you that we renamed

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:49.076 A:middle
MiterLineJoinStyle to by

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:50.126 A:middle
LineJoinStyleMiter.

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:51.846 A:middle
And, I also said that

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:53.786 A:middle
Objective-C source code was 100%

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:54.326 A:middle
compatible.

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:56.066 A:middle
So, you might be wondering,

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:57.076 A:middle
well, what happened to that old

00:09:57.076 --> 00:09:58.336 A:middle
symbol that you renamed?

00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:00.066 A:middle
Well, we actually declared that
