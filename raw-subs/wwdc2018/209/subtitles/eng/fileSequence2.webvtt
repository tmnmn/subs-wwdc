00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:00.116 A:middle
And, here are some examples.

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:02.326 A:middle
The first one is declared as NS

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:03.286 A:middle
STRING ENUM.

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:05.356 A:middle
This is used for string

00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:07.206 A:middle
enumerations, where we provide

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:08.156 A:middle
some values out of the

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:09.666 A:middle
frameworks with no ability to

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.206 A:middle
extend them, so it's a fixed set

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:12.016 A:middle
of values.

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:14.556 A:middle
The next two here, NS EXTENSIBLE

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:17.456 A:middle
STRING ENUM, this is used to

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:19.416 A:middle
declare string enumerations

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:20.646 A:middle
where we might provide some

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:22.346 A:middle
values out of the box, but other

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:23.936 A:middle
frameworks and applications can

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.746 A:middle
also add to that set.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:28.176 A:middle
So, we've done two changes here.

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:29.866 A:middle
First one is a simple one.

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:31.896 A:middle
We've simply replaced NS STRING

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:34.766 A:middle
ENUM and NS STRING EXTENSIBLE

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:36.226 A:middle
ENUM with their typed variants.

00:02:36.226 --> 00:02:37.566 A:middle
This is effectively a no-op

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
change.

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:39.376 A:middle
These are just more general

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:40.866 A:middle
forms of the same declarations.

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:43.056 A:middle
So, no changes in your code, or

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:44.076 A:middle
call sites, or anything.

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:46.216 A:middle
Now, the next one, NSImageName,

00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:49.066 A:middle
underwent a bigger change, a

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.726 A:middle
more significant change, instead

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:52.256 A:middle
of a string enumeration, it's

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.226 A:middle
now declared as NS SWIFT BRIDGED

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:56.316 A:middle
TYPEDEF, which is effectively a

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:56.766 A:middle
typedef.

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.456 A:middle
Now, here's what the Swift

00:02:58.456 --> 00:02:59.716 A:middle
exposure of this looks like.
