00:35:59.336 --> 00:36:00.436 A:middle
text like this, and the

00:36:00.436 --> 00:36:02.506 A:middle
insertion point is in the

00:36:02.506 --> 00:36:04.156 A:middle
lighter portion at the end, and

00:36:04.156 --> 00:36:06.496 A:middle
we run the same code; this is

00:36:06.496 --> 00:36:06.966 A:middle
the result.

00:36:07.896 --> 00:36:09.746 A:middle
The style attributes come from

00:36:09.746 --> 00:36:10.896 A:middle
the lighter portion at the end.

00:36:12.486 --> 00:36:14.036 A:middle
So, for this reason, you may

00:36:14.036 --> 00:36:15.316 A:middle
find that you need to set the

00:36:15.316 --> 00:36:16.896 A:middle
selective range for the range

00:36:16.896 --> 00:36:18.136 A:middle
you're about to replace before

00:36:18.136 --> 00:36:18.606 A:middle
you call

00:36:18.606 --> 00:36:19.956 A:middle
performValidatedReplacement.

00:36:22.896 --> 00:36:24.416 A:middle
If you do that, this is the

00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:25.216 A:middle
result that you get.

00:36:27.336 --> 00:36:28.966 A:middle
So, the next topic I'd like to

00:36:28.966 --> 00:36:30.436 A:middle
cover very briefly, is

00:36:30.466 --> 00:36:31.406 A:middle
continuity camera.

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.346 A:middle
This is another fantastic

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:35.376 A:middle
feature in macOS Mojave.

00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:37.216 A:middle
And, if you're just using the

00:36:37.216 --> 00:36:38.746 A:middle
standard framework classes like

00:36:38.746 --> 00:36:40.196 A:middle
NSTextView, there's nothing

00:36:40.196 --> 00:36:41.746 A:middle
special you need to do in order

00:36:41.746 --> 00:36:42.766 A:middle
to take advantage of it.

00:36:42.806 --> 00:36:43.606 A:middle
So, framework will handle

00:36:43.606 --> 00:36:44.336 A:middle
everything for you.

00:36:45.016 --> 00:36:45.996 A:middle
But, if you have a more

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:49.136 A:middle
application-specific need for

00:36:49.306 --> 00:36:50.536 A:middle
this, it is possible to use it

00:36:50.536 --> 00:36:51.186 A:middle
more directly.

00:36:51.336 --> 00:36:52.296 A:middle
And then, it's important to

00:36:52.296 --> 00:36:53.806 A:middle
understand that it's implemented

00:36:53.806 --> 00:36:55.766 A:middle
using the existing services

00:36:55.766 --> 00:36:56.066 A:middle
API's.

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:58.236 A:middle
So, all you need to do is tell a

00:36:58.236 --> 00:36:59.756 A:middle
framework that your responder

00:36:59.756 --> 00:37:01.306 A:middle
class is able to handle image
