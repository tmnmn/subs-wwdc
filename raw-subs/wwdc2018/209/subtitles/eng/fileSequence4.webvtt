00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:01.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:02.726 A:middle
Yes, we had heard from some of

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:02.916 A:middle
you.

00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:05.856 A:middle
So, we believe this appropriate

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.336 A:middle
for passed-through values, such

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:08.636 A:middle
as resource names or

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:09.396 A:middle
identifiers.

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:11.756 A:middle
Basically, values that are not

00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:13.266 A:middle
interpreted by the framework but

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:14.026 A:middle
are just used in a

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:14.926 A:middle
passed-through fashion.

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:16.886 A:middle
So, image name, color name,

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:18.495 A:middle
window frame autosave names, and

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:18.875 A:middle
so on.

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:19.906 A:middle
So, these are the types that are

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.136 A:middle
appropriate for this.

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:23.386 A:middle
Now, note that you still have

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:25.056 A:middle
the benefits of a specific API

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:26.446 A:middle
declaration however with this

00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:27.046 A:middle
new approach.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:28.826 A:middle
Here's the declaration for

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:30.146 A:middle
NSImage named method.

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:31.226 A:middle
You'll note that the argument is

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:33.656 A:middle
still NSImage.Name, as opposed

00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:34.166 A:middle
to a string.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:35.386 A:middle
So, we still have that come

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:35.676 A:middle
through.

00:04:36.516 --> 00:04:37.526 A:middle
Now, here's the full list of

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:37.926 A:middle
types.

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:39.086 A:middle
We did this to NSAppKit.

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:42.476 A:middle
Turns out a lot of types could

00:04:42.686 --> 00:04:43.656 A:middle
benefit from this.

00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:46.746 A:middle
It's not just this, it's also

00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:47.606 A:middle
this set as well.

00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:48.906 A:middle
So, a number of types have

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:50.236 A:middle
changed in this fashion.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.546 A:middle
So, next, I'm going to talk

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:55.816 A:middle
about common prefixes.

00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:57.446 A:middle
As you've seen in previous

00:04:57.446 --> 00:04:58.576 A:middle
years, over time, we've been

00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:00.866 A:middle
switching from common suffixes,
