00:37:59.846 --> 00:38:01.726 A:middle
either always show them, or to

00:38:01.726 --> 00:38:03.076 A:middle
flip to them when you hold down

00:38:03.076 --> 00:38:03.776 A:middle
the function key.

00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:05.736 A:middle
Or, you can customize your Touch

00:38:05.806 --> 00:38:07.796 A:middle
Bar and drag the workflows

00:38:07.796 --> 00:38:09.146 A:middle
button into your control script.

00:38:11.596 --> 00:38:12.706 A:middle
It's also worth noting that you

00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:13.876 A:middle
can go over to the Shortcuts

00:38:13.936 --> 00:38:15.926 A:middle
pane, and look under Services.

00:38:16.496 --> 00:38:18.096 A:middle
And, here you can turn them on

00:38:18.096 --> 00:38:19.346 A:middle
and off to control which ones

00:38:19.576 --> 00:38:21.416 A:middle
show up.

00:38:21.416 --> 00:38:22.366 A:middle
They don't only show up in the

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.336 A:middle
Touch Bar, though, as I

00:38:23.336 --> 00:38:23.776 A:middle
mentioned.

00:38:23.776 --> 00:38:25.006 A:middle
So, here's a Finder window for

00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:25.576 A:middle
example.

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.366 A:middle
And, the contextual menu has a

00:38:27.366 --> 00:38:29.106 A:middle
Quick Actions submenu where

00:38:29.186 --> 00:38:31.086 A:middle
you'll see them.

00:38:31.466 --> 00:38:33.386 A:middle
Finder's preview pane also has a

00:38:33.386 --> 00:38:34.436 A:middle
couple of Quick Actions at the

00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:36.026 A:middle
bottom, and then the full list

00:38:36.296 --> 00:38:37.406 A:middle
underneath the "More" button.

00:38:38.056 --> 00:38:39.456 A:middle
And, action bundles from

00:38:39.456 --> 00:38:41.046 A:middle
Automator will show up inside

00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:41.866 A:middle
the Services menu.

00:38:42.396 --> 00:38:44.036 A:middle
So, TrimLogs is one that I wrote

00:38:44.036 --> 00:38:45.556 A:middle
to filter my debug logs, for

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:45.936 A:middle
example.

00:38:47.176 --> 00:38:48.776 A:middle
And, that brings me to the next

00:38:48.776 --> 00:38:50.176 A:middle
topic I'd like to talk about,

00:38:50.516 --> 00:38:52.166 A:middle
building action bundles, also

00:38:52.166 --> 00:38:53.816 A:middle
known as contextual workflows.

00:38:54.406 --> 00:38:55.636 A:middle
This is a new feature in

00:38:55.636 --> 00:38:56.216 A:middle
Automator.

00:38:56.516 --> 00:38:57.456 A:middle
When you go to Automator, and

00:38:57.456 --> 00:38:58.546 A:middle
create a new document, there's a

00:38:58.546 --> 00:38:59.886 A:middle
new option available now for

00:38:59.886 --> 00:39:01.006 A:middle
contextual workflows.
