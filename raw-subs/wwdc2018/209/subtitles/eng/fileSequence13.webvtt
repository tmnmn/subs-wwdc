00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.906 A:middle
transforming values from one to

00:13:01.026 --> 00:13:01.526 A:middle
another.

00:13:02.076 --> 00:13:03.466 A:middle
These two valueTransformers

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:05.416 A:middle
here-- unarchiveFromData and

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:07.806 A:middle
keyedUnarchivedFromData-- the

00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:09.436 A:middle
first one does unkeyed

00:13:09.436 --> 00:13:10.426 A:middle
archiving, the second one does

00:13:10.426 --> 00:13:11.366 A:middle
keyed archiving, but not

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:11.966 A:middle
securely.

00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:14.506 A:middle
And so, these are now not

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:16.026 A:middle
working in the way we like, so

00:13:16.026 --> 00:13:17.396 A:middle
we're deprecating these two.

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:18.616 A:middle
And, replacing them with this

00:13:18.616 --> 00:13:19.696 A:middle
new secure Unarchive

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:21.156 A:middle
FromDataTransformerName, which

00:13:21.156 --> 00:13:22.526 A:middle
will do the unarchiving

00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:23.086 A:middle
securely.

00:13:23.316 --> 00:13:24.476 A:middle
So, we urge you to switch to

00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:25.386 A:middle
this one as well.

00:13:25.716 --> 00:13:28.696 A:middle
Now, on the secure coding front,

00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:29.666 A:middle
we've also gone ahead and

00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:30.806 A:middle
adopted secure coding in a

00:13:30.806 --> 00:13:32.036 A:middle
number of AppKit classes that

00:13:32.036 --> 00:13:32.716 A:middle
didn't do it yet.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.536 A:middle
Note here, NSAppearance, which

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.186 A:middle
is a recent, relatively recent

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
class that is increasingly

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:40.566 A:middle
becoming your friend, as you'll

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:42.106 A:middle
see in later talks about Dark

00:13:42.106 --> 00:13:43.476 A:middle
Mode and other features we've

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:44.246 A:middle
added in AppKit.

00:13:44.906 --> 00:13:46.246 A:middle
We've also added secure coding

00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:47.716 A:middle
to a few foundation API's that

00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:48.356 A:middle
did not have it.

00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:49.946 A:middle
And, here is that list.

00:13:51.136 --> 00:13:52.296 A:middle
Now, one more note on secure

00:13:52.296 --> 00:13:52.686 A:middle
coding.

00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:54.756 A:middle
We have a talk Thursday morning,

00:13:55.856 --> 00:13:58.196 A:middle
"Data You Can Trust," where

00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:59.666 A:middle
we'll talk about doing coding
