00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:00.386 A:middle
them out, so the user can still

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:02.066 A:middle
recognize these as clickable and

00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:02.616 A:middle
interactable.

00:22:03.846 --> 00:22:05.146 A:middle
So, that's really easy to do.

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.586 A:middle
NSButton and NSImageView, both

00:22:08.586 --> 00:22:09.536 A:middle
have a new property called

00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:10.456 A:middle
contentTintColor.

00:22:10.816 --> 00:22:11.916 A:middle
You can set it to any color you

00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:13.236 A:middle
want, to those dynamic colors I

00:22:13.236 --> 00:22:14.276 A:middle
mentioned earlier are great

00:22:14.276 --> 00:22:14.856 A:middle
candidates.

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:16.826 A:middle
You can also set these up in

00:22:16.826 --> 00:22:17.596 A:middle
Interface Builder.

00:22:17.926 --> 00:22:19.256 A:middle
So, this is what the UI looks

00:22:19.256 --> 00:22:20.436 A:middle
like for configuring buttons.

00:22:20.726 --> 00:22:21.986 A:middle
And, this is what it looks like

00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:23.106 A:middle
for configuring image views.

00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:25.066 A:middle
The tint option is here on the

00:22:25.066 --> 00:22:27.936 A:middle
right, in the sidebar.

00:22:28.396 --> 00:22:29.836 A:middle
So, we've covered a lot of great

00:22:29.836 --> 00:22:31.516 A:middle
stuff about what you can do with

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.706 A:middle
the new appearance in macOS

00:22:32.706 --> 00:22:33.446 A:middle
10.14.

00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:35.146 A:middle
We have more sessions on it, but

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:36.696 A:middle
they're in the WWDC app, if you

00:22:36.696 --> 00:22:37.666 A:middle
look at our latest sessions.

00:22:37.976 --> 00:22:40.376 A:middle
They're both absolutely great.

00:22:40.556 --> 00:22:41.406 A:middle
Which brings me to my next

00:22:41.406 --> 00:22:41.706 A:middle
topic.

00:22:42.896 --> 00:22:44.026 A:middle
No discussion of Cocoa is

00:22:44.026 --> 00:22:45.316 A:middle
complete without some talk of

00:22:45.316 --> 00:22:45.976 A:middle
layer backing.

00:22:47.436 --> 00:22:48.946 A:middle
So, I wanted to let you all know

00:22:49.096 --> 00:22:51.056 A:middle
that in macOS 10.14, when you

00:22:51.056 --> 00:22:52.046 A:middle
link against the new SDK,

00:22:52.046 --> 00:22:54.666 A:middle
AppKit's not going to use a

00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:56.066 A:middle
legacy window backing store any

00:22:56.066 --> 00:22:56.296 A:middle
more.

00:22:56.596 --> 00:22:58.016 A:middle
It's going to provide all of

00:22:58.016 --> 00:22:59.246 A:middle
this content to the window

00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:00.906 A:middle
server using core animation
