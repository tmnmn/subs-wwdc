00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:01.176 A:middle
to want to do, is we're going to

00:15:01.176 --> 00:15:02.406 A:middle
search our application for

00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:03.936 A:middle
places we've hardcoded color

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:04.376 A:middle
values.

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:05.266 A:middle
And, we're going to want to

00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:05.966 A:middle
replace them with an

00:15:05.966 --> 00:15:07.086 A:middle
appearance-sensitive color

00:15:07.086 --> 00:15:07.486 A:middle
instead.

00:15:08.696 --> 00:15:10.646 A:middle
For, most system UI elements,

00:15:10.906 --> 00:15:12.656 A:middle
AppKit actually offers a lot of

00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:14.226 A:middle
dynamic system colors that will

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:15.106 A:middle
react with the current

00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:16.546 A:middle
appearance, and look great for

00:15:16.546 --> 00:15:18.166 A:middle
whatever UI element you're

00:15:18.166 --> 00:15:19.216 A:middle
trying to come across with.

00:15:19.476 --> 00:15:20.466 A:middle
And, to flesh out the list,

00:15:20.466 --> 00:15:22.156 A:middle
we've added even more in macOS

00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:23.006 A:middle
10.14.

00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:25.836 A:middle
But, in some cases you're not

00:15:25.836 --> 00:15:26.676 A:middle
trying to make a system UI

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.026 A:middle
element, you're trying to make

00:15:28.026 --> 00:15:29.206 A:middle
some piece of your document

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:30.596 A:middle
model that also looks great in

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.156 A:middle
Dark Mode.

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:32.836 A:middle
Now, you can do this by sorting

00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:34.806 A:middle
your colors in asset catalogs.

00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:37.276 A:middle
So, if you go to the color

00:15:37.276 --> 00:15:39.166 A:middle
editor in Xcode, you can

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:40.416 A:middle
configure which appearances

00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:42.246 A:middle
you'd like to set up specific

00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:44.206 A:middle
colors for, using the sidebar on

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:44.526 A:middle
the right.

00:15:45.046 --> 00:15:46.466 A:middle
In this case, we've picked

00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:47.986 A:middle
colors explicitly for the light

00:15:47.986 --> 00:15:49.266 A:middle
appearance, for the dark

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.396 A:middle
appearance, and a general

00:15:50.396 --> 00:15:51.706 A:middle
fallback color for any other

00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:52.246 A:middle
appearances.

00:15:52.756 --> 00:15:56.296 A:middle
Similar to with colors, we're

00:15:56.296 --> 00:15:57.436 A:middle
going to want to go through our

00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:59.096 A:middle
UI's and find places we can use

00:15:59.156 --> 00:15:59.876 A:middle
template images.
