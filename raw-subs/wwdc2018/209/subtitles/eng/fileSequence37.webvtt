00:36:59.756 --> 00:37:01.306 A:middle
class is able to handle image

00:37:01.336 --> 00:37:01.606 A:middle
data.

00:37:01.926 --> 00:37:02.876 A:middle
And, you can do this by

00:37:02.876 --> 00:37:04.366 A:middle
implementing validRequestor.

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:07.006 A:middle
If you want to try this out, I'd

00:37:07.006 --> 00:37:08.046 A:middle
encourage you to check out the

00:37:08.046 --> 00:37:09.866 A:middle
documentation for validRequestor

00:37:09.866 --> 00:37:11.126 A:middle
and some of the related methods.

00:37:13.686 --> 00:37:15.196 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:37:15.326 --> 00:37:16.296 A:middle
custom Quick Actions.

00:37:16.436 --> 00:37:17.496 A:middle
You heard a little bit about

00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:19.716 A:middle
Quick Actions from the State of

00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:21.126 A:middle
the Union session yesterday.

00:37:21.126 --> 00:37:23.746 A:middle
And, they make it very easy to

00:37:24.466 --> 00:37:26.496 A:middle
perform simple actions like

00:37:26.496 --> 00:37:27.916 A:middle
opening a favorite app, for

00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:29.476 A:middle
complex ones like filtering

00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:33.076 A:middle
files, or invoking scripts.

00:37:33.326 --> 00:37:35.406 A:middle
You can build custom Quick

00:37:35.406 --> 00:37:38.936 A:middle
Actions using app extensions or

00:37:38.936 --> 00:37:40.296 A:middle
action bundles from Automator.

00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:42.116 A:middle
They're useful in so many

00:37:42.116 --> 00:37:43.926 A:middle
different places that there's a

00:37:43.926 --> 00:37:45.406 A:middle
variety of ways to invoke them.

00:37:45.406 --> 00:37:47.176 A:middle
But, my favorite by far is the

00:37:47.246 --> 00:37:47.676 A:middle
Touch Bar.

00:37:48.376 --> 00:37:49.816 A:middle
If you put your Quick Actions in

00:37:49.816 --> 00:37:51.036 A:middle
the Touch Bar, it just makes it

00:37:51.036 --> 00:37:52.246 A:middle
very easy to get to them,

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:53.746 A:middle
wherever you are, whenever you

00:37:53.746 --> 00:37:54.186 A:middle
need them.

00:37:54.656 --> 00:37:55.786 A:middle
And, you can get this behavior

00:37:55.786 --> 00:37:56.816 A:middle
by looking in the keyboard

00:37:56.816 --> 00:37:58.326 A:middle
preferences panel, and

00:37:58.326 --> 00:37:59.846 A:middle
reconfiguring your Touch Bar to

00:37:59.846 --> 00:38:01.726 A:middle
either always show them, or to
