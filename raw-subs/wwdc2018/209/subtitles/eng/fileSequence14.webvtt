00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.776 A:middle
and archiving and unarchiving in

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:03.296 A:middle
a robust and secure fashion.

00:14:03.396 --> 00:14:05.146 A:middle
So, I invite you to attend that.

00:14:05.196 --> 00:14:07.716 A:middle
Thursday morning at 9.

00:14:07.916 --> 00:14:09.566 A:middle
So, at this point, the rest of

00:14:09.566 --> 00:14:10.756 A:middle
the talk is going to be about

00:14:10.756 --> 00:14:12.036 A:middle
the new features in AppKit and

00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:12.876 A:middle
related areas.

00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.466 A:middle
And, to kick that off I invite

00:14:14.506 --> 00:14:14.976 A:middle
Chris on stage.

00:14:15.516 --> 00:14:20.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:21.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ali.

00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:23.806 A:middle
So, Dark Mode is one of the most

00:14:23.806 --> 00:14:25.036 A:middle
exciting new features in macOS

00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:25.946 A:middle
10.14.

00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:27.386 A:middle
And, I'm sure you all saw

00:14:27.386 --> 00:14:28.796 A:middle
yesterday, I bet some of you are

00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:29.656 A:middle
running it right now.

00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:30.796 A:middle
But, let's go ahead and take a

00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:31.076 A:middle
look.

00:14:32.036 --> 00:14:34.666 A:middle
So, we have these great new sets

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:35.556 A:middle
of system artwork.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.336 A:middle
It makes our system UI look

00:14:37.336 --> 00:14:37.616 A:middle
great.

00:14:37.616 --> 00:14:38.676 A:middle
It makes your application look

00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:38.936 A:middle
great.

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:39.996 A:middle
It's going to make your user

00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:40.836 A:middle
content look great.

00:14:41.186 --> 00:14:42.436 A:middle
And, what we all want to know is

00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:44.586 A:middle
what we need to do to adopt

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:45.326 A:middle
this.

00:14:45.526 --> 00:14:47.146 A:middle
So, the first step is really

00:14:47.146 --> 00:14:47.536 A:middle
simple.

00:14:47.906 --> 00:14:49.246 A:middle
We need to relink against the

00:14:49.246 --> 00:14:50.906 A:middle
macOS 10.14 SDK.

00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:52.146 A:middle
That's easy enough.

00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:53.496 A:middle
That might be enough for some of

00:14:53.496 --> 00:14:54.736 A:middle
us, too, but most of us are

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:55.836 A:middle
going to need to do a little bit

00:14:55.836 --> 00:14:57.406 A:middle
more work to make an app that

00:14:57.406 --> 00:14:57.896 A:middle
looks great.

00:14:58.676 --> 00:14:59.656 A:middle
So, the next thing we're going

00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:01.176 A:middle
to want to do, is we're going to
