00:10:59.196 --> 00:11:00.366 A:middle
you are archiving, basically

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:01.286 A:middle
allows you to specify what

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.226 A:middle
classes are expected, that way

00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:04.916 A:middle
it can be an explicit error if

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:05.766 A:middle
those classes are not

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:06.946 A:middle
encountered in the archive.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.106 A:middle
Now, the way we did secure

00:11:09.106 --> 00:11:13.626 A:middle
coding, the secure coding was an

00:11:13.626 --> 00:11:14.436 A:middle
optional feature.

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:16.766 A:middle
But, we now have new API's that

00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:18.886 A:middle
enable both secure coding as a

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.376 A:middle
default behavior, and as a

00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:21.866 A:middle
bonus, they enable error

00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:22.556 A:middle
returns.

00:11:23.076 --> 00:11:24.526 A:middle
Our archiver and unarchiver

00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:25.836 A:middle
API's worked with exceptions,

00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:27.016 A:middle
but of course we prefer error

00:11:27.016 --> 00:11:27.576 A:middle
returns.

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:29.606 A:middle
And, the new API's enabled error

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.006 A:middle
return behaviors by default.

00:11:32.296 --> 00:11:34.086 A:middle
So, I'll show you the API's

00:11:34.086 --> 00:11:35.616 A:middle
NSKeyedUnarchiver, since that's

00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:36.546 A:middle
the most interesting.

00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:38.506 A:middle
Here is an NSKeyedUnarchiver.

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:39.896 A:middle
One new method is in it.

00:11:39.976 --> 00:11:40.866 A:middle
It simply creates a

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.296 A:middle
keyedUnarchiver, securely, and

00:11:43.296 --> 00:11:44.876 A:middle
in a way will return errors.

00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:47.736 A:middle
Two other new methods are these

00:11:47.736 --> 00:11:49.296 A:middle
convenience API's,

00:11:49.296 --> 00:11:51.506 A:middle
unarchivedObject(ofClasses from,

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:53.556 A:middle
and unarchivedObject(ofClass

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:53.986 A:middle
from.

00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:56.086 A:middle
These basically unarchive a

00:11:56.086 --> 00:11:57.466 A:middle
single object and return it.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.046 A:middle
They do it securely, and they

00:11:59.046 --> 00:12:01.246 A:middle
will return an error if some
