00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:03.846 A:middle
In Swift 4, NSImage.Name came

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:05.216 A:middle
across as a struct, which is the

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:06.686 A:middle
way you would declare the string

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.596 A:middle
enumerations.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:09.886 A:middle
In Swift 4.2, it's as a

00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:12.276 A:middle
typealias, a simple, good old,

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:13.926 A:middle
garden variety typealias.

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:14.936 A:middle
Much simpler.

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:17.246 A:middle
So, the question is, why did we

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:17.726 A:middle
do this?

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:19.216 A:middle
Let's look at a call site

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:19.826 A:middle
example.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:24.786 A:middle
Here in Swift 4 is how you would

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.486 A:middle
take a string, and create an

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:28.946 A:middle
NSImage with it, by using the

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:29.606 A:middle
named method.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.686 A:middle
As you'll see here, you'll be

00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:32.986 A:middle
taking the string, and we're

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:34.936 A:middle
converting it to an NSImage.Name

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:36.126 A:middle
into the [inaudible] name before

00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:37.456 A:middle
we call NSImage named.

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:38.796 A:middle
This does not feel

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:40.526 A:middle
super-streamlined to have to

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.316 A:middle
repeat NSImage.Name here.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.806 A:middle
Now, with changes in Swift 4.2,

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:46.206 A:middle
this is all we have to write.

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:47.536 A:middle
You do not have to convert to

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.246 A:middle
the NSImage name, which is more

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.736 A:middle
streamlined, a little cleaner,

00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:51.846 A:middle
less redundancy there.

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:53.636 A:middle
So, we believe this typedef

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:55.576 A:middle
approach is appropriate for

00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:55.976 A:middle
passed-through values.

00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:01.126 A:middle
