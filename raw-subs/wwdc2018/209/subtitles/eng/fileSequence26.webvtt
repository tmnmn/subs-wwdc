00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:00.536 A:middle
rect version.

00:26:00.746 --> 00:26:01.996 A:middle
And, we also use that for things

00:26:01.996 --> 00:26:02.556 A:middle
like printing.

00:26:02.616 --> 00:26:03.916 A:middle
So, it's fine to implement both

00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:04.296 A:middle
of these.

00:26:05.056 --> 00:26:06.386 A:middle
If you have a view that you

00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:07.726 A:middle
really can't express using the

00:26:07.806 --> 00:26:09.346 A:middle
CG drawing API's, or the AppKit

00:26:09.346 --> 00:26:11.336 A:middle
drawing API's, you can, in

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:12.406 A:middle
addition to the update layer

00:26:12.406 --> 00:26:13.576 A:middle
method, override

00:26:13.576 --> 00:26:15.796 A:middle
wantsUpdateLayer, and if you

00:26:15.796 --> 00:26:16.906 A:middle
just return "true" from that, we

00:26:16.906 --> 00:26:18.186 A:middle
know that you need an explicit

00:26:18.186 --> 00:26:19.716 A:middle
layer to do what you want to

00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:20.216 A:middle
accomplish.

00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:24.626 A:middle
There's another way of taking

00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.476 A:middle
best advantage of AppKit and

00:26:26.476 --> 00:26:27.746 A:middle
core animations features here,

00:26:27.976 --> 00:26:29.236 A:middle
and that's just to build your

00:26:29.236 --> 00:26:30.206 A:middle
UI's out of a very simple

00:26:30.206 --> 00:26:33.096 A:middle
vocabulary of basic NSViews.

00:26:33.456 --> 00:26:35.166 A:middle
NSImageView, NSBox, and

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.926 A:middle
NSTextField, these are all

00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:38.336 A:middle
really great building blocks to

00:26:38.336 --> 00:26:39.446 A:middle
make complicated UI's, and

00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:40.766 A:middle
they'll do the right thing no

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:42.286 A:middle
matter what technologies we pick

00:26:42.286 --> 00:26:43.546 A:middle
to actually render to the

00:26:43.546 --> 00:26:43.966 A:middle
screen.

00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:46.546 A:middle
With our changes to layer

00:26:46.546 --> 00:26:48.376 A:middle
backing, there's a few patterns

00:26:48.376 --> 00:26:49.566 A:middle
I want to call out that aren't

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:50.996 A:middle
going to work in macOS 10.14

00:26:50.996 --> 00:26:51.396 A:middle
anymore.

00:26:51.996 --> 00:26:53.616 A:middle
If you're using NSView lockFocus

00:26:53.616 --> 00:26:55.106 A:middle
and unlockFocus, or trying to

00:26:55.106 --> 00:26:56.566 A:middle
access the window's graphics

00:26:56.566 --> 00:26:59.046 A:middle
contents directly, there's a

00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.116 A:middle
better way of doing that.
