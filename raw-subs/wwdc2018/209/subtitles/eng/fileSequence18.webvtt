00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.536 A:middle
don't be daunted by this task.

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:03.026 A:middle
AppKit is going to help you.

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:05.976 A:middle
So, there's some great classes

00:18:05.976 --> 00:18:06.826 A:middle
you're already familiar with

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:07.886 A:middle
that are just going to do the

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.056 A:middle
right thing out of the box.

00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:10.486 A:middle
And, it's Window, and it's

00:18:10.486 --> 00:18:11.806 A:middle
ScrollView, and it's TableView,

00:18:11.806 --> 00:18:12.546 A:middle
and it's CollectionView.

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.266 A:middle
All of these will look great in

00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:15.716 A:middle
Dark Mode without any changes.

00:18:16.126 --> 00:18:16.876 A:middle
But, if you want to get your

00:18:16.876 --> 00:18:18.596 A:middle
hands on them, you can also

00:18:18.596 --> 00:18:20.466 A:middle
tweak these a little bit.

00:18:20.816 --> 00:18:21.926 A:middle
Each of these classes has a

00:18:21.926 --> 00:18:23.126 A:middle
background color property.

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:24.706 A:middle
And, there's four very special

00:18:24.816 --> 00:18:26.386 A:middle
NS colors I want to mention, the

00:18:26.386 --> 00:18:27.806 A:middle
control background color, the

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.336 A:middle
window background color, and the

00:18:29.336 --> 00:18:30.766 A:middle
underpage and text background

00:18:30.796 --> 00:18:31.126 A:middle
colors.

00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:32.676 A:middle
And these all, when used with

00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:34.586 A:middle
these classes, get that nice bit

00:18:34.586 --> 00:18:36.356 A:middle
of desktop picture infusion, and

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:37.436 A:middle
all look slightly different

00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:38.566 A:middle
depending on the role of the UI

00:18:38.646 --> 00:18:39.406 A:middle
element you're trying to

00:18:39.406 --> 00:18:39.996 A:middle
construct.

00:18:41.176 --> 00:18:42.526 A:middle
One other class I really want to

00:18:42.526 --> 00:18:44.566 A:middle
call out for this purpose is the

00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:45.516 A:middle
NSBox class.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.386 A:middle
If you configure a box as a

00:18:47.386 --> 00:18:49.066 A:middle
custom style, you can use its

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:50.626 A:middle
fill color property with one of

00:18:50.626 --> 00:18:51.826 A:middle
these special NS colors, or

00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:53.186 A:middle
really any other NS color, too.

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.106 A:middle
But, that's significant, because

00:18:55.106 --> 00:18:56.466 A:middle
NSBox can be used to just add

00:18:56.466 --> 00:18:57.856 A:middle
wonderful color fills to pieces

00:18:57.856 --> 00:18:59.296 A:middle
of your UI, whereas these other

00:18:59.296 --> 00:19:00.546 A:middle
classes are a little bit more
