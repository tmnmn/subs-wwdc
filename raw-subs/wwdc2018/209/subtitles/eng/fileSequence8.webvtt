00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
please go ahead and clean these

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:01.186 A:middle
usages.

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:04.346 A:middle
And, the fix is pretty

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:05.086 A:middle
straightforward.

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:06.196 A:middle
Instead of accessing the

00:08:06.196 --> 00:08:07.366 A:middle
instance variable directly,

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:08.866 A:middle
please go ahead and call the

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:10.006 A:middle
getter, or the property

00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:11.346 A:middle
accessed, or whatever there

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:11.806 A:middle
might be.

00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:14.116 A:middle
And, if you have some reason to

00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:15.246 A:middle
access the instance variable,

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.266 A:middle
and you don't see a way around

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:17.496 A:middle
it, you might want to let us

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:17.706 A:middle
know.

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:20.216 A:middle
Now, speaking of deprecation,

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:21.626 A:middle
we're doing one more thing

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:25.326 A:middle
called formal soft deprecation.

00:08:25.976 --> 00:08:26.906 A:middle
So, over the years we have

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.866 A:middle
deprecated a lot of API's, and

00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:29.986 A:middle
have replaced them with better

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:30.416 A:middle
ones.

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:32.275 A:middle
In cases where the deprecation

00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:33.976 A:middle
isn't urgent, we usually go

00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:35.346 A:middle
through an informal deprecation

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:36.765 A:middle
phase, where we tell you the

00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:38.336 A:middle
API's deprecated, we release

00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:39.916 A:middle
note it, we comment it, and so

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.426 A:middle
on, before we actually mark the

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:42.456 A:middle
API's deprecated.

00:08:42.836 --> 00:08:44.116 A:middle
Usually to reduce disruption.

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:46.016 A:middle
But now, we have a way to mark

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:47.366 A:middle
API's as to be formally

00:08:47.366 --> 00:08:47.956 A:middle
deprecated.

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:49.556 A:middle
Let me give you an example.

00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:51.626 A:middle
Here we have a symbol,

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.356 A:middle
NSBoxOldStyle, which of course

00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:55.846 A:middle
happens to be a name that begs

00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:56.626 A:middle
to be deprecated.

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:58.176 A:middle
And, you'll note that we've

00:08:58.206 --> 00:08:59.696 A:middle
marked it as deprecated.
