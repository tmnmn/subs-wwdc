00:32:58.456 --> 00:33:01.686 A:middle
macOS 10.13.4, or if you're not

00:33:01.686 --> 00:33:03.306 A:middle
using merged cells, you can

00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:04.256 A:middle
actually go all the way back to

00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:05.016 A:middle
10.12.

00:33:05.556 --> 00:33:07.616 A:middle
So, if you need to deploy your

00:33:07.616 --> 00:33:08.696 A:middle
app to an older version of

00:33:08.696 --> 00:33:10.776 A:middle
macOS, there's still no reason

00:33:10.776 --> 00:33:12.176 A:middle
to wait to use this great new

00:33:12.176 --> 00:33:12.796 A:middle
functionality.

00:33:15.186 --> 00:33:17.076 A:middle
The next topic I'd like to cover

00:33:17.126 --> 00:33:18.826 A:middle
is some changes to NSTextView.

00:33:20.176 --> 00:33:21.286 A:middle
First off,there's a few new

00:33:21.286 --> 00:33:22.046 A:middle
factory methods.

00:33:22.756 --> 00:33:24.466 A:middle
The first one here, fieldEditor

00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:27.756 A:middle
configures a textView to act as

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:29.156 A:middle
the fieldEditor for an

00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:29.816 A:middle
NSTextField.

00:33:29.936 --> 00:33:32.716 A:middle
These all provide a much easier

00:33:32.716 --> 00:33:34.276 A:middle
way to configure textViews for

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:35.226 A:middle
common use cases.

00:33:36.256 --> 00:33:38.666 A:middle
The latter three provide

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:39.806 A:middle
textViews wrapped in

00:33:39.806 --> 00:33:40.366 A:middle
scrollViews.

00:33:40.946 --> 00:33:42.296 A:middle
This is by far the most common

00:33:42.296 --> 00:33:44.266 A:middle
use case for a textView, but if

00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:45.156 A:middle
you have to do additional

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.406 A:middle
configuration on the textView,

00:33:46.406 --> 00:33:47.786 A:middle
it's important to remember to

00:33:47.786 --> 00:33:49.526 A:middle
look at the scrollView's

00:33:49.576 --> 00:33:50.146 A:middle
documentView.

00:33:51.426 --> 00:33:52.756 A:middle
These are also available through

00:33:52.756 --> 00:33:53.526 A:middle
Interface Builder.

00:33:53.526 --> 00:33:54.566 A:middle
So, again, there's no need to

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:55.816 A:middle
fall back to the programmatic

00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:56.436 A:middle
API here.

00:33:57.366 --> 00:33:58.246 A:middle
So, let's see what they look

00:33:58.246 --> 00:33:58.446 A:middle
like.

00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:00.776 A:middle
Here's a sample window that
