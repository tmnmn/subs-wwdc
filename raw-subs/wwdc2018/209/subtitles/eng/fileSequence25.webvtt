00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:00.966 A:middle
And, this is mostly fine, but

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.306 A:middle
NSView actually gives you a lot

00:25:02.306 --> 00:25:03.636 A:middle
of functionality you probably

00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:04.796 A:middle
don't want to have to replicate

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:05.276 A:middle
yourself.

00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:08.526 A:middle
If you use NSView's draw method,

00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:09.886 A:middle
it'll go ahead and take care of

00:25:09.886 --> 00:25:11.056 A:middle
things like making sure that the

00:25:11.056 --> 00:25:12.226 A:middle
appearance works correctly for

00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:13.056 A:middle
dynamic colors.

00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:14.586 A:middle
It'll manage the backing store

00:25:14.586 --> 00:25:15.476 A:middle
resolution for you.

00:25:15.876 --> 00:25:17.156 A:middle
And, it's really just as simple

00:25:17.156 --> 00:25:18.266 A:middle
as implementing the layer

00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:18.706 A:middle
methods.

00:25:18.986 --> 00:25:19.986 A:middle
So, I really encourage you to

00:25:19.986 --> 00:25:21.166 A:middle
override drawing at the view

00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:22.206 A:middle
level instead of the layer

00:25:22.206 --> 00:25:22.516 A:middle
level.

00:25:23.626 --> 00:25:25.576 A:middle
Sometimes you'll have cases

00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:27.606 A:middle
where you were implementing the

00:25:27.606 --> 00:25:29.016 A:middle
display method of CALayer

00:25:29.016 --> 00:25:30.216 A:middle
instead, and you're updating

00:25:30.216 --> 00:25:31.486 A:middle
layer properties directly,

00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:32.486 A:middle
because maybe it's more

00:25:32.486 --> 00:25:33.706 A:middle
efficient, or really expresses

00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:34.786 A:middle
what you're trying to accomplish

00:25:34.786 --> 00:25:35.136 A:middle
better.

00:25:35.446 --> 00:25:37.426 A:middle
You can still do that using the

00:25:37.426 --> 00:25:39.196 A:middle
NSView API by overriding the

00:25:39.196 --> 00:25:40.806 A:middle
update layer method, and you get

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.106 A:middle
all the same benefits you do by

00:25:42.106 --> 00:25:43.446 A:middle
using the NSView draw rect

00:25:43.446 --> 00:25:43.786 A:middle
method.

00:25:44.556 --> 00:25:46.756 A:middle
A quirk I want to point out, is

00:25:46.756 --> 00:25:48.026 A:middle
you can implement both update

00:25:48.026 --> 00:25:49.646 A:middle
layer, and the draw methods on

00:25:49.686 --> 00:25:50.226 A:middle
NSView.

00:25:50.846 --> 00:25:52.256 A:middle
If you do this, when your view

00:25:52.256 --> 00:25:53.576 A:middle
has a single layer backing it,

00:25:53.576 --> 00:25:54.496 A:middle
we'll go ahead and use the

00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:55.546 A:middle
optimal layer version.

00:25:56.006 --> 00:25:57.296 A:middle
And, if you're being merged with

00:25:57.296 --> 00:25:58.546 A:middle
other views to save memory,

00:25:58.896 --> 00:25:59.976 A:middle
we'll go ahead and use the draw

00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:00.536 A:middle
rect version.
