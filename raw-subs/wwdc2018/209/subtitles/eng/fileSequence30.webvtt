00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:01.556 A:middle
When you wanted to center an

00:30:01.556 --> 00:30:02.876 A:middle
item in the toolbar, you've

00:30:02.876 --> 00:30:05.226 A:middle
maybe been tempted to put a

00:30:05.226 --> 00:30:07.236 A:middle
flexible space on both sides of

00:30:07.236 --> 00:30:07.686 A:middle
your item.

00:30:07.686 --> 00:30:09.446 A:middle
And, this works, but it has some

00:30:09.446 --> 00:30:09.926 A:middle
drawbacks.

00:30:10.076 --> 00:30:11.706 A:middle
Notably, when you add extra

00:30:11.706 --> 00:30:13.106 A:middle
items to the toolbar, it'll push

00:30:13.106 --> 00:30:14.246 A:middle
your item off-center.

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.716 A:middle
So, NSToolbar now exposes a new

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:17.456 A:middle
property, the

00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:18.616 A:middle
centeredItemIdentifier.

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:20.596 A:middle
You can set this to the

00:30:20.596 --> 00:30:21.906 A:middle
identifier of an item you'd like

00:30:21.906 --> 00:30:23.416 A:middle
to remain centered, and

00:30:23.456 --> 00:30:24.876 A:middle
NSToolbar will put it there.

00:30:25.486 --> 00:30:26.736 A:middle
It should stay there unless

00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:28.376 A:middle
other Toolbar items actually

00:30:28.376 --> 00:30:29.696 A:middle
force it to be out of place.

00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:32.326 A:middle
There's another change here

00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:35.426 A:middle
worth noting as well, which is

00:30:35.426 --> 00:30:38.616 A:middle
that auto layout is now used to

00:30:38.616 --> 00:30:40.036 A:middle
measure toolbar items when the

00:30:40.036 --> 00:30:41.816 A:middle
minimum and maximum sizes are

00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:42.616 A:middle
not specified.

00:30:44.846 --> 00:30:46.466 A:middle
This applies only to apps on the

00:30:46.466 --> 00:30:48.746 A:middle
10.14 SDK, but it means that you

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:50.066 A:middle
can do things like change the

00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:52.046 A:middle
size of the button, and the

00:30:52.046 --> 00:30:52.976 A:middle
measurement will happen for you.

00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:59.546 A:middle
