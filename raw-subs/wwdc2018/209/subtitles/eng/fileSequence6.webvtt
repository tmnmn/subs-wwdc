00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:01.376 A:middle
Next, I want to talk about

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:02.506 A:middle
formalized protocols.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.966 A:middle
In the olden days, we used to

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:06.936 A:middle
use informal protocols, which

00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:08.176 A:middle
are basically categories on

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:09.556 A:middle
NSObject to group related

00:06:09.596 --> 00:06:10.356 A:middle
methods together.

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:11.906 A:middle
And, since then, we added

00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:13.056 A:middle
features such as optional

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.846 A:middle
methods on protocols and so on,

00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:15.626 A:middle
and we've been switching to

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.096 A:middle
formal protocols where possible.

00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:19.336 A:middle
And, I'll show you an example of

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:20.996 A:middle
one of the ones we did this

00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:21.476 A:middle
release.

00:06:23.156 --> 00:06:24.056 A:middle
Here is the method

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:26.106 A:middle
validateMenuItem, and it used to

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:28.826 A:middle
be an informal protocol, a

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:31.026 A:middle
categorization object in 10.13.

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:32.526 A:middle
Now, it's a formal protocol,

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.376 A:middle
called NSMenuItemValidation,

00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:35.216 A:middle
with .method in it.

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:37.336 A:middle
The Swift exposure changes from

00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:39.866 A:middle
an extension NSObject to a

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.016 A:middle
formal protocol, of course.

00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:42.886 A:middle
NSMenuItemValidation in Swift

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:43.566 A:middle
4.2.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:44.986 A:middle
Of course, the benefits here are

00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:46.846 A:middle
that objects that do menu item

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:48.416 A:middle
validation now have a way to

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:49.956 A:middle
formally declare that they do

00:06:49.956 --> 00:06:51.036 A:middle
that by conforming to this

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:51.506 A:middle
protocol.

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:53.426 A:middle
Again, we like this so much, we

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:54.526 A:middle
did it across a bunch of other

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:55.246 A:middle
API's.

00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:57.656 A:middle
So, here's the full list of

00:06:57.656 --> 00:06:59.146 A:middle
formal protocols we added in

00:06:59.146 --> 00:06:59.586 A:middle
AppKit.
