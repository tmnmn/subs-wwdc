00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:00.066 A:middle
Well, we actually declared that

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.596 A:middle
old symbol, as you see here, by

00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:03.496 A:middle
using this new API TO BE

00:10:03.496 --> 00:10:03.976 A:middle
DEPRECATED.

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:06.896 A:middle
So, we declare it as deprecated,

00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:08.936 A:middle
as API TO BE DEPRECATED, meaning

00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:11.406 A:middle
any new attempts to use it will

00:10:11.406 --> 00:10:13.336 A:middle
get warnings, but existing uses

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:14.806 A:middle
will be left alone, because we

00:10:14.806 --> 00:10:15.766 A:middle
really don't want to disrupt

00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:17.236 A:middle
uses of the symbol in

00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:21.346 A:middle
Objective-C source code.

00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:22.576 A:middle
Now, turns out there was a lot

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:25.186 A:middle
of symbols that were waiting for

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:27.546 A:middle
this facility, so a lot of API's

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:29.006 A:middle
are marked with API TO BE

00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:29.626 A:middle
DEPRECATED.

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:31.246 A:middle
A bunch of these are because we

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:33.326 A:middle
did the common suffix to common

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:35.046 A:middle
prefix naming, and some of the

00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:36.406 A:middle
others are symbols that we are

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.156 A:middle
de-emphasizing deprecating,

00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:39.766 A:middle
because we're bringing new ones

00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:39.926 A:middle
in.

00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:40.936 A:middle
Especially in support of

00:10:40.936 --> 00:10:42.276 A:middle
features such as Dark Mode,

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:43.586 A:middle
which you'll hear about later

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:43.836 A:middle
today.

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.996 A:middle
So, the last topic I want to

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:48.326 A:middle
talk about is secure coding.

00:10:49.186 --> 00:10:50.116 A:middle
As you may be aware, we

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:53.016 A:middle
introduced the concept of secure

00:10:53.016 --> 00:10:56.336 A:middle
coding back in 10.8 and iOS 6.

00:10:56.446 --> 00:10:59.196 A:middle
It basically allows class-- when

00:10:59.196 --> 00:11:00.366 A:middle
you are archiving, basically
