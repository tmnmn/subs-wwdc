00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.116 A:middle
better way of doing that.

00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:01.656 A:middle
You should just subclass NSView

00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:02.556 A:middle
and implement draw rect.

00:27:02.846 --> 00:27:04.786 A:middle
Both of those methods have been

00:27:04.786 --> 00:27:06.876 A:middle
kind of finicky for a while.

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:07.836 A:middle
So, you'll be saving yourself

00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:08.326 A:middle
some trouble.

00:27:08.756 --> 00:27:09.716 A:middle
The other thing I want to point

00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:10.686 A:middle
out is I've actually written

00:27:10.686 --> 00:27:12.236 A:middle
these in Objective-C, which is a

00:27:12.236 --> 00:27:13.606 A:middle
little weird for a talk that's

00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:14.986 A:middle
mostly in Swift.

00:27:14.986 --> 00:27:16.486 A:middle
And, the really great news about

00:27:16.486 --> 00:27:18.146 A:middle
this is I've never actually seen

00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:19.676 A:middle
any Swift code using these.

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:21.656 A:middle
The takeaway from that is I

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:22.986 A:middle
really don't want any of you to

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:24.456 A:middle
be the first to go ahead and

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:25.056 A:middle
surprise me.

00:27:26.456 --> 00:27:29.816 A:middle
So, we have one more thing about

00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:31.086 A:middle
our changes with layer backing.

00:27:31.456 --> 00:27:33.326 A:middle
If you're using NSOpenGL classes

00:27:33.326 --> 00:27:34.726 A:middle
to render with OpenGL, and you

00:27:34.726 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
link against macOS 10.14, some

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:38.466 A:middle
of our implementation details

00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:39.756 A:middle
for how we bind the OpenGL

00:27:39.756 --> 00:27:41.576 A:middle
system to our layers are a bit

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:41.976 A:middle
different.

00:27:41.976 --> 00:27:43.146 A:middle
And, you may notice a few small

00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:43.816 A:middle
changes there.

00:27:44.576 --> 00:27:45.846 A:middle
But, more importantly, I want to

00:27:45.846 --> 00:27:48.206 A:middle
call out that as of macOS 10.14,

00:27:48.426 --> 00:27:49.756 A:middle
OpenGL on our platform is

00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:50.426 A:middle
deprecated.

00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:52.626 A:middle
If you've been using NSOpenGL

00:27:52.626 --> 00:27:54.286 A:middle
view, we really encourage you to

00:27:54.286 --> 00:27:55.846 A:middle
adopt MTKView instead.

00:27:55.956 --> 00:27:57.166 A:middle
And, there's a great session

00:27:57.166 --> 00:27:58.676 A:middle
coming up later today about

00:27:58.676 --> 00:27:59.986 A:middle
adopting Metal for OpenGL

00:27:59.986 --> 00:28:00.556 A:middle
developers.
