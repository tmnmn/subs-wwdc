00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:01.506 A:middle
When it observes this

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:03.336 A:middle
notification, it reloads its

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:04.876 A:middle
data if necessary, and, then,

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:06.416 A:middle
for the purpose of this example,

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:07.346 A:middle
it sets a flag.

00:15:08.316 --> 00:15:10.376 A:middle
This way, our test code can

00:15:10.456 --> 00:15:11.846 A:middle
check that the flag to see if

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:12.996 A:middle
the notification was actually

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:13.406 A:middle
received.

00:15:13.876 --> 00:15:15.956 A:middle
We can see here that it's using

00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:17.526 A:middle
the default notification center

00:15:17.526 --> 00:15:18.456 A:middle
to add the observer.

00:15:19.916 --> 00:15:21.066 A:middle
Let's take a look at what a unit

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:22.166 A:middle
test for this code might look

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:22.436 A:middle
like.

00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:25.616 A:middle
Here in our test for this class,

00:15:25.836 --> 00:15:27.466 A:middle
we post the authChanged method

00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:29.066 A:middle
notification to simulate it, and

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:30.516 A:middle
we post it to the default

00:15:30.516 --> 00:15:32.096 A:middle
NotificationCenter, the same one

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:33.366 A:middle
that our view controller uses.

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.166 A:middle
Now, this test works, but it may

00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:37.506 A:middle
have unknown side effects

00:15:37.506 --> 00:15:38.716 A:middle
elsewhere in our app's code.

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:40.796 A:middle
It's common for some system

00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:42.406 A:middle
notifications like UI

00:15:42.406 --> 00:15:43.196 A:middle
applications

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:44.496 A:middle
appDidFinishLaunching

00:15:44.496 --> 00:15:46.086 A:middle
notification to be observed by

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:47.756 A:middle
many layers and to have unknown

00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:49.826 A:middle
side effects, or it could simply

00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:50.986 A:middle
slow down our tests.

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:53.286 A:middle
So, we'd like to isolate this

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.576 A:middle
code better to test this.

00:15:55.016 --> 00:15:57.996 A:middle
There's a technique we can use

00:15:57.996 --> 00:15:59.576 A:middle
to better isolate these tests.
