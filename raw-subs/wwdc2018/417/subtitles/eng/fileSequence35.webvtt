00:34:59.956 --> 00:35:01.346 A:middle
ensure that your app launches as

00:35:01.346 --> 00:35:02.256 A:middle
quickly as possible.

00:35:03.396 --> 00:35:04.796 A:middle
Now, most apps have to do some

00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:06.066 A:middle
amount of setup work at launch

00:35:06.066 --> 00:35:07.916 A:middle
time, and, although that work is

00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:09.236 A:middle
necessary for regular app

00:35:09.236 --> 00:35:11.576 A:middle
launches, when your app is being

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:13.256 A:middle
launched as a test runner, a lot

00:35:13.256 --> 00:35:14.446 A:middle
of that work may be unnecessary.

00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:16.366 A:middle
Things like loading view

00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:18.216 A:middle
controllers, kicking off network

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.296 A:middle
requests, or configuring

00:35:20.296 --> 00:35:21.976 A:middle
analytics packages-- these are

00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:23.096 A:middle
all examples of things that are

00:35:23.096 --> 00:35:24.586 A:middle
commonly unnecessary in unit

00:35:24.586 --> 00:35:25.516 A:middle
testing scenarios.

00:35:26.836 --> 00:35:28.656 A:middle
XCTest waits until your app

00:35:28.696 --> 00:35:30.186 A:middle
delegates did finish launching

00:35:30.186 --> 00:35:31.666 A:middle
method returns before beginning

00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:32.486 A:middle
to run tests.

00:35:33.126 --> 00:35:34.786 A:middle
So, if you profile and notice

00:35:34.816 --> 00:35:36.256 A:middle
that app launch is taking a long

00:35:36.256 --> 00:35:38.596 A:middle
time in your tests, then one tip

00:35:38.626 --> 00:35:39.866 A:middle
is to detect when your app is

00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:41.256 A:middle
launched as a test runner and

00:35:41.256 --> 00:35:41.856 A:middle
avoid this work.

00:35:42.516 --> 00:35:46.656 A:middle
One way to do this is to specify

00:35:46.656 --> 00:35:48.156 A:middle
a custom environment variable or

00:35:48.156 --> 00:35:48.776 A:middle
launch argument.

00:35:49.896 --> 00:35:51.606 A:middle
Open the scheme editor, go to

00:35:51.606 --> 00:35:52.876 A:middle
the test action on the left

00:35:52.876 --> 00:35:54.946 A:middle
side, then to the arguments tab,

00:35:55.346 --> 00:35:56.916 A:middle
and add either an environment

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.276 A:middle
variable or a launch argument.

00:35:59.316 --> 00:36:00.806 A:middle
