00:35:59.316 --> 00:36:00.806 A:middle
In this screenshot, I've added

00:36:00.806 --> 00:36:02.226 A:middle
an environment variable named

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:04.056 A:middle
IS-UNIT-TESTING set to 1.

00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:08.066 A:middle
Then, modify your app delegate's

00:36:08.216 --> 00:36:09.976 A:middle
appDidFinishLaunching code to

00:36:09.976 --> 00:36:11.266 A:middle
check for this condition, using

00:36:11.266 --> 00:36:12.406 A:middle
code similar to this.

00:36:13.606 --> 00:36:15.136 A:middle
Now, if you do this, be sure

00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:16.866 A:middle
that the code you skip truly is

00:36:16.866 --> 00:36:18.526 A:middle
nonessential for your unit test

00:36:18.526 --> 00:36:19.000 A:middle
to function.

00:36:23.106 --> 00:36:27.226 A:middle
So, to wrap up, Brian started by

00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:28.376 A:middle
reminding us about the testing

00:36:28.376 --> 00:36:29.976 A:middle
pyramid and how to have a

00:36:29.976 --> 00:36:31.226 A:middle
balanced testing strategy in

00:36:31.226 --> 00:36:32.846 A:middle
your app, showing several

00:36:32.846 --> 00:36:34.656 A:middle
practical techniques for testing

00:36:34.656 --> 00:36:35.666 A:middle
network operations.

00:36:36.956 --> 00:36:38.596 A:middle
Then, I talked about isolating

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.886 A:middle
foundation notifications and

00:36:40.886 --> 00:36:42.056 A:middle
using dependency injection.

00:36:43.506 --> 00:36:44.906 A:middle
We offered a solution to one of

00:36:44.906 --> 00:36:46.326 A:middle
the most common challenges when

00:36:46.326 --> 00:36:48.196 A:middle
writing tests, interacting with

00:36:48.196 --> 00:36:50.306 A:middle
external classes, even if they

00:36:50.306 --> 00:36:51.056 A:middle
have a delegate.

00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:53.506 A:middle
And we shared some tips for

00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:55.036 A:middle
keeping your tests running fast

00:36:55.036 --> 00:36:56.666 A:middle
and avoiding artificial delays.

00:36:57.866 --> 00:36:58.836 A:middle
We really hope you'll find these

00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:00.126 A:middle
tests useful and look for ways
