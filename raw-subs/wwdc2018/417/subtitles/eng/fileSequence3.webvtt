00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:00.676 A:middle
integration tests that targeted

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:02.916 A:middle
discreet subsystem or cluster of

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.176 A:middle
classes in your app, checking

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:05.906 A:middle
that they worked together

00:03:05.906 --> 00:03:07.826 A:middle
properly, each taking no more

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:08.926 A:middle
than a few seconds to run.

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:13.176 A:middle
And the suite is topped off by a

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.606 A:middle
handful of end-to-end system

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:16.436 A:middle
tests, most often taking the

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:19.016 A:middle
form of UI tests that exercise

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:20.906 A:middle
the app in a way very similar to

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:22.336 A:middle
how the end-user will do so on

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:25.196 A:middle
their devices, checking that all

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:26.036 A:middle
the pieces are hooked up

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:28.486 A:middle
properly and interact well with

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:30.006 A:middle
the underlying operating system

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:31.476 A:middle
and external resources.

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:34.946 A:middle
A test suite following this

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:36.526 A:middle
model can provide a

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
comprehensive picture of how an

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.266 A:middle
app code's base is functioning.

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:45.056 A:middle
For testing the networking stack

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.966 A:middle
in this app, we really wanted to

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:48.346 A:middle
take the pyramid model to heart

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:50.436 A:middle
and use it as a guide for how to

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:52.026 A:middle
structure our test suite.

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:54.626 A:middle
Here, we see the high-level data

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:56.126 A:middle
flow involved in making a

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:58.036 A:middle
network request in the app and

00:03:58.076 --> 00:03:59.146 A:middle
feeding the data into the UI.
