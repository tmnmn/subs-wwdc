00:06:58.716 --> 00:07:00.966 A:middle
APIRequest protocol with methods

00:07:01.016 --> 00:07:02.326 A:middle
matching the signature of the

00:07:02.326 --> 00:07:03.326 A:middle
methods from the request type

00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:04.036 A:middle
that we just saw.

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.536 A:middle
And this is used by an

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:08.156 A:middle
APIRequestLoader class.

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:10.666 A:middle
That's initialized with a

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:13.536 A:middle
request type and a urlSession

00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:16.906 A:middle
instance.

00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:19.546 A:middle
This class has a loadAPIRequest

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:21.586 A:middle
method which uses that

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:23.526 A:middle
apiRequest value to generate a

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.316 A:middle
URL request.

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.106 A:middle
Feed that into the urlSession,

00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:29.566 A:middle
and then use the apiRequest

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:30.966 A:middle
again to parse in your response.

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:36.316 A:middle
Now, we can continue write unit

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:38.256 A:middle
test for this method, but right

00:07:38.256 --> 00:07:39.356 A:middle
now I actually want to move up

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:41.026 A:middle
the pyramid and look at a

00:07:41.026 --> 00:07:42.876 A:middle
midlevel integration test that

00:07:42.876 --> 00:07:44.006 A:middle
covers several pieces of this

00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:44.496 A:middle
data flow.

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:48.226 A:middle
Another thing that I really want

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:50.446 A:middle
to also be able to test at this

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:52.326 A:middle
layer of my suite is that my

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:54.296 A:middle
interaction with the URLSession

00:07:54.296 --> 00:07:55.746 A:middle
APIs is correct.

00:07:56.756 --> 00:07:58.526 A:middle
It turns out that the foundation

00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:00.256 A:middle
URL loading system provides a
