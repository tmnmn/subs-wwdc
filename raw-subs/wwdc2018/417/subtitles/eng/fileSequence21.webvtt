00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.836 A:middle
So, notice that we're calling

00:21:01.836 --> 00:21:03.456 A:middle
the request location method on

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:04.716 A:middle
CLLocationManager, here.

00:21:04.716 --> 00:21:07.666 A:middle
When we call this, it'll attempt

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.396 A:middle
to get the current location and

00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:10.556 A:middle
eventually call a delegate

00:21:10.556 --> 00:21:11.536 A:middle
method on our class.

00:21:12.156 --> 00:21:14.106 A:middle
So, let's go look at that

00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:15.186 A:middle
delegate method.

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:16.946 A:middle
We use an extension to conform

00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:18.756 A:middle
to the CLLocationManagerDelegate

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:20.256 A:middle
protocol here, and we call a

00:21:20.256 --> 00:21:21.416 A:middle
stored completion block.

00:21:22.486 --> 00:21:23.966 A:middle
Okay, so let's try writing a

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:26.636 A:middle
unit test for this class.

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:27.766 A:middle
Here's one that I tried to

00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:29.016 A:middle
write, and, if we read through

00:21:29.016 --> 00:21:30.886 A:middle
it, we can see that it starts by

00:21:30.886 --> 00:21:31.616 A:middle
creating a

00:21:31.616 --> 00:21:33.776 A:middle
CurrentLocationProvider and

00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:35.486 A:middle
checks that the desired accuracy

00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:37.006 A:middle
and whether the delegate is set.

00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:38.166 A:middle
So far, so good.

00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:40.466 A:middle
But then things get tricky.

00:21:41.356 --> 00:21:42.276 A:middle
We want to check the

00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:43.686 A:middle
checkCurrentLocation method,

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.066 A:middle
since that's where our main

00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:47.036 A:middle
logic lives, but we have a

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:47.466 A:middle
problem.

00:21:48.236 --> 00:21:49.656 A:middle
We don't have a way to know when

00:21:49.656 --> 00:21:51.136 A:middle
the request location method is

00:21:51.136 --> 00:21:52.976 A:middle
called, since that's a method on

00:21:53.076 --> 00:21:55.456 A:middle
CLLocationManager and not part

00:21:56.276 --> 00:21:57.396 A:middle
our code.

00:21:57.606 --> 00:21:58.486 A:middle
Another problem that we're

00:21:58.486 --> 00:21:59.856 A:middle
likely to encounter in this test
