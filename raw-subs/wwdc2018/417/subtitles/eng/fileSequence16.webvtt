00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:01.496 A:middle
To use it, we first have to

00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:02.186 A:middle
recognize that

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:03.576 A:middle
NotificationCenter can have

00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:04.646 A:middle
multiple instances.

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:08.106 A:middle
As you may note, it has a

00:16:08.256 --> 00:16:09.526 A:middle
default instance as a class

00:16:09.526 --> 00:16:10.766 A:middle
property, but it supports

00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:12.106 A:middle
creating additional instances

00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:13.536 A:middle
whenever necessary, and this is

00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:14.936 A:middle
going to be key to isolating our

00:16:14.936 --> 00:16:15.516 A:middle
tests.

00:16:16.436 --> 00:16:18.036 A:middle
So, to apply this technique, we

00:16:18.036 --> 00:16:19.386 A:middle
first have to create a new

00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:21.376 A:middle
NotificationCenter, pass it to

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.366 A:middle
our subject and use it instead

00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:24.376 A:middle
of the default instance.

00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:26.636 A:middle
This is often referred to as

00:16:26.636 --> 00:16:27.546 A:middle
dependency injection.

00:16:28.486 --> 00:16:29.716 A:middle
So, let's take a look at using

00:16:29.716 --> 00:16:30.546 A:middle
this in our view controller.

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:33.256 A:middle
Here, I have the original code

00:16:33.256 --> 00:16:34.476 A:middle
that uses the default

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.096 A:middle
NotificationCenter, and I'll

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:37.456 A:middle
modify it to use a separate

00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:38.006 A:middle
instance.

00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:40.136 A:middle
I've added a new

00:16:40.136 --> 00:16:42.046 A:middle
NotificationCenter property and

00:16:42.046 --> 00:16:43.316 A:middle
a parameter in the initializer

00:16:43.316 --> 00:16:43.896 A:middle
that sets it.

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:45.756 A:middle
And, instead of adding an

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:47.446 A:middle
observer to the default center,

00:16:47.446 --> 00:16:51.626 A:middle
it uses this new property.

00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:53.046 A:middle
I'll also add a default

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.076 A:middle
parameter value of .default to

00:16:55.076 --> 00:16:57.056 A:middle
the initializer, and this avoids

00:16:57.056 --> 00:16:58.656 A:middle
breaking any existing code in my

00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:00.526 A:middle
app, since existing clients
