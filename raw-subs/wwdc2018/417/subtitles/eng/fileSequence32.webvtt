00:31:59.816 --> 00:32:00.556 A:middle
class interacts with.

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:02.666 A:middle
So, we can apply the mocking

00:32:02.666 --> 00:32:03.826 A:middle
with protocols technique we

00:32:03.826 --> 00:32:04.896 A:middle
discussed earlier here.

00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:07.806 A:middle
To do that, we'll create a small

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.296 A:middle
protocol, containing this

00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:10.156 A:middle
addTimer method.

00:32:10.816 --> 00:32:13.266 A:middle
I've called this new protocol

00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:15.376 A:middle
TimerScheduler, and it just has

00:32:15.406 --> 00:32:17.466 A:middle
that one addTimer method, which

00:32:17.466 --> 00:32:18.956 A:middle
matches the signature of the

00:32:18.956 --> 00:32:21.796 A:middle
runLoop API.

00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:23.836 A:middle
Now, back in my code, I need to

00:32:23.836 --> 00:32:25.326 A:middle
replace the runLoop with the

00:32:25.326 --> 00:32:26.746 A:middle
protocol that I just created.

00:32:27.296 --> 00:32:31.416 A:middle
And in my tests, I don't want to

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:32.406 A:middle
use a real runLoop as my

00:32:32.406 --> 00:32:33.246 A:middle
TimerScheduler.

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:35.306 A:middle
Instead, I want to create a mock

00:32:35.396 --> 00:32:36.996 A:middle
scheduler that passes the timer

00:32:37.086 --> 00:32:39.646 A:middle
to my tests.

00:32:39.686 --> 00:32:40.846 A:middle
I'll do this by creating a new

00:32:40.846 --> 00:32:42.666 A:middle
struct nested in my unit test

00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:44.626 A:middle
class called MockTimerScheduler,

00:32:44.926 --> 00:32:46.286 A:middle
conforming to the TimerScheduler

00:32:46.286 --> 00:32:46.716 A:middle
protocol.

00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:49.146 A:middle
It stores a block that will be

00:32:49.316 --> 00:32:50.756 A:middle
called whenever it's told to add

00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:53.766 A:middle
a timer.

00:32:53.766 --> 00:32:54.696 A:middle
And with all the pieces in

00:32:54.696 --> 00:32:56.406 A:middle
place, I can write my final unit

00:32:56.406 --> 00:32:56.776 A:middle
test.

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:58.866 A:middle
First, I create a

00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:01.086 A:middle
MockTimerScheduler and configure
