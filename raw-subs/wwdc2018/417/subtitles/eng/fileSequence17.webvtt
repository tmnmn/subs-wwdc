00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:00.526 A:middle
app, since existing clients

00:17:00.596 --> 00:17:01.486 A:middle
won't need to pass the new

00:17:01.486 --> 00:17:03.366 A:middle
parameter, only our unit tests

00:17:03.366 --> 00:17:03.556 A:middle
will.

00:17:05.096 --> 00:17:07.076 A:middle
Now let's go back and update our

00:17:07.076 --> 00:17:07.616 A:middle
tests.

00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:10.046 A:middle
Here's the original test code,

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:12.786 A:middle
and now I've modified it to use

00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:14.165 A:middle
a separate NotificationCenter.

00:17:17.455 --> 00:17:19.366 A:middle
So, this shows how we can test

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:20.606 A:middle
that our subject observes a

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.906 A:middle
notification, but how do we test

00:17:22.906 --> 00:17:23.776 A:middle
that our subject posts a

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:24.415 A:middle
notification?

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:27.026 A:middle
We'll use the same separate

00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:28.916 A:middle
NotificationCenter trick again,

00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:30.346 A:middle
but I'll also show how to make

00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:32.366 A:middle
use of built-in expectation APIs

00:17:32.366 --> 00:17:33.776 A:middle
to add a notification observer.

00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:36.746 A:middle
So, here's another section of

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:38.096 A:middle
code from our app, the

00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:39.686 A:middle
CurrentLocationProvider class.

00:17:40.536 --> 00:17:41.706 A:middle
I'll talk more about this class

00:17:41.706 --> 00:17:44.106 A:middle
later, but notice that it has

00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:45.246 A:middle
this method for signaling to

00:17:45.246 --> 00:17:47.066 A:middle
other classes in my app that the

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.776 A:middle
app's location authorization has

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:49.896 A:middle
changed by posting a

00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:50.566 A:middle
notification.

00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:53.286 A:middle
As with our view controller,

00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:54.726 A:middle
it's currently hardcoding the

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:56.066 A:middle
default NotificationCenter.

00:17:56.646 --> 00:17:59.836 A:middle
And here's a unit test I wrote

00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:00.716 A:middle
for this class.
