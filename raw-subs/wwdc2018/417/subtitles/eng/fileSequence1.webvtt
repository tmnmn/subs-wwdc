giving it views for finding

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.596 A:middle
various point of interest around

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.586 A:middle
San Jose and listing how far

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.385 A:middle
they are away from you.

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.806 A:middle
Now, of course, we wanted to

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:10.466 A:middle
make sure we had a really great

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:12.636 A:middle
test suite for this app that we

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:14.226 A:middle
could run to give us confidence

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:15.416 A:middle
that our code was working

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:17.476 A:middle
properly and would keep working

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:18.616 A:middle
as we continue development.

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:24.246 A:middle
Today, we want to share four

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:25.636 A:middle
simple techniques with you that

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:27.086 A:middle
we found really helpful while

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.026 A:middle
writing tests for our app.

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:32.076 A:middle
Some strategies for testing

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:33.806 A:middle
networking code in your app,

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:36.836 A:middle
some tips for tests dealing with

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:38.516 A:middle
foundation notification objects,

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:41.356 A:middle
ways to take advantage of

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:43.176 A:middle
protocols when making mock

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.026 A:middle
objects in your tests, and a few

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:47.066 A:middle
techniques for keeping your

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.556 A:middle
tests running really fast.

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:53.346 A:middle
Let's start talking about

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:53.926 A:middle
networking.

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:57.066 A:middle
To allow for dynamic content

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.856 A:middle
updates, we've been building our

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:00.326 A:middle
app to load its data from a
