00:28:58.626 --> 00:29:00.406 A:middle
sleep in your tests, because the

00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:01.686 A:middle
code your testing is

00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:03.166 A:middle
asynchronous or uses a timer.

00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:05.886 A:middle
Delayed actions can be tricky,

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:06.996 A:middle
so we want to be sure to include

00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:08.576 A:middle
them in our tests, but they can

00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:10.246 A:middle
also slow things down a lot if

00:29:10.246 --> 00:29:10.786 A:middle
we're not careful.

00:29:11.856 --> 00:29:13.066 A:middle
So, I'd like to talk about some

00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:13.936 A:middle
ways that we can avoid

00:29:13.936 --> 00:29:15.526 A:middle
artificial delays in our tests,

00:29:15.806 --> 00:29:16.506 A:middle
since they should never be

00:29:16.506 --> 00:29:17.036 A:middle
necessary.

00:29:17.636 --> 00:29:19.896 A:middle
Here's an example.

00:29:19.956 --> 00:29:21.946 A:middle
In the points of interest app

00:29:21.946 --> 00:29:23.526 A:middle
Brian and I are building, in the

00:29:23.526 --> 00:29:25.116 A:middle
main UI, we have a strip at the

00:29:25.116 --> 00:29:26.506 A:middle
bottom that shows the featured

00:29:26.506 --> 00:29:26.936 A:middle
place.

00:29:27.546 --> 00:29:28.606 A:middle
It basically loops through the

00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:30.706 A:middle
top places nearby, rotating to

00:29:30.706 --> 00:29:32.136 A:middle
show a new location every 10

00:29:32.136 --> 00:29:32.666 A:middle
seconds.

00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:34.906 A:middle
Now, there are several ways I

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.426 A:middle
might implement this, but, here,

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:37.996 A:middle
I'm using the timer API for

00:29:37.996 --> 00:29:38.616 A:middle
foundation.

00:29:38.616 --> 00:29:42.106 A:middle
Let's look at a unit test that I

00:29:42.106 --> 00:29:43.076 A:middle
might write for this class.

00:29:44.106 --> 00:29:44.696 A:middle
It creates a

00:29:44.696 --> 00:29:46.996 A:middle
FeaturedPlaceManager and stores

00:29:46.996 --> 00:29:49.186 A:middle
its current place before calling

00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:50.636 A:middle
the scheduleNextPlace method.

00:29:51.526 --> 00:29:53.376 A:middle
Then it runs the run loop for 11

00:29:53.376 --> 00:29:53.926 A:middle
seconds.

00:29:53.976 --> 00:29:55.676 A:middle
I added an extra second as a

00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:56.226 A:middle
grace period.

00:29:57.416 --> 00:29:58.456 A:middle
And, finally, it checks that the

00:29:58.456 --> 00:29:59.916 A:middle
currentPlace changed at the end.
