00:18:58.696 --> 00:19:01.186 A:middle
subject, but take a look at the

00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:02.146 A:middle
expectation now.

00:19:03.366 --> 00:19:04.586 A:middle
When our tests are expecting to

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:06.196 A:middle
receive a notification to a

00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:08.436 A:middle
specific center, we can pass the

00:19:08.436 --> 00:19:10.156 A:middle
NotificationCenter parameter to

00:19:10.156 --> 00:19:10.956 A:middle
the initializer of the

00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:11.656 A:middle
expectation.

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:15.576 A:middle
I'd also like to point out that

00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:18.086 A:middle
the timeout of this expectation

00:19:18.086 --> 00:19:19.736 A:middle
is 0, and that's because we

00:19:19.736 --> 00:19:21.006 A:middle
actually expect it to already

00:19:21.006 --> 00:19:22.306 A:middle
have been fulfilled by the time

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:22.806 A:middle
we wait on it.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.216 A:middle
That's because the notification

00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:26.446 A:middle
should have already been posted

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:27.236 A:middle
by the time the

00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:28.616 A:middle
NotifyAuthChanged method

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:29.216 A:middle
returns.

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:31.946 A:middle
So, using this pair of

00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:32.846 A:middle
techniques for testing

00:19:32.846 --> 00:19:34.746 A:middle
notifications we can ensure that

00:19:34.746 --> 00:19:35.756 A:middle
our tests remained fully

00:19:35.756 --> 00:19:37.856 A:middle
isolated, and we've made the

00:19:37.856 --> 00:19:39.426 A:middle
change without needing to modify

00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:40.616 A:middle
an existing code in our app,

00:19:40.956 --> 00:19:42.346 A:middle
since we specified that default

00:19:42.416 --> 00:19:46.976 A:middle
parameter value.

00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:49.216 A:middle
So, next, I'd like to talk about

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:50.456 A:middle
a frequent challenge when

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:52.466 A:middle
writing unit tests, interacting

00:19:52.466 --> 00:19:53.666 A:middle
with external classes.

00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:57.036 A:middle
So, while developing your app,

00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:58.376 A:middle
you've probably run into

00:19:58.376 --> 00:20:00.546 A:middle
situations where your class is
