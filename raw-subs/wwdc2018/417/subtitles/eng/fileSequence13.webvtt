00:12:58.956 --> 00:13:01.566 A:middle
responses without having to deal

00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:02.736 A:middle
with the complications of

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:04.326 A:middle
testing your UI at the same

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:05.000 A:middle
time.

00:13:10.396 --> 00:13:12.596 A:middle
So, to wrap up, we've seen an

00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:14.476 A:middle
example of breaking code into

00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:16.306 A:middle
smaller, independent pieces to

00:13:16.306 --> 00:13:17.566 A:middle
facilitate unit testing.

00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:21.506 A:middle
We've seen how URLProtocol can

00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:23.426 A:middle
be used as a tool for mocking

00:13:23.426 --> 00:13:24.386 A:middle
network requests,

00:13:24.646 --> 00:13:27.426 A:middle
and we've discussed how the

00:13:27.426 --> 00:13:29.046 A:middle
power of the pyramid can be used

00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:30.336 A:middle
to help us structure a

00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:32.006 A:middle
well-balanced test suite that'll

00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:33.156 A:middle
give us good confidence in our

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:34.046 A:middle
code.

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:36.656 A:middle
Now, I want to call Stuart to

00:13:36.656 --> 00:13:38.176 A:middle
the stage to talk about some

00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:38.886 A:middle
more techniques.

00:13:40.516 --> 00:13:42.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:43.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:13:46.616 --> 00:13:47.286 A:middle
Thanks, Brian.

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:49.626 A:middle
So, the first area I'd like to

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:51.016 A:middle
talk about is some best

00:13:51.056 --> 00:13:52.226 A:middle
practices for testing

00:13:52.226 --> 00:13:53.066 A:middle
notifications.

00:13:54.776 --> 00:13:57.036 A:middle
And to clarify, by notification

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.276 A:middle
here, I'm talking about

00:13:58.426 --> 00:13:59.916 A:middle
foundation-level notifications
