00:33:59.136 --> 00:34:00.496 A:middle
mock delayed actions at all.

00:34:01.556 --> 00:34:03.986 A:middle
For example, in our app, the

00:34:04.026 --> 00:34:05.446 A:middle
action being delayed was

00:34:05.446 --> 00:34:06.746 A:middle
changing to the next featured

00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:07.166 A:middle
place.

00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:09.916 A:middle
I probably only need one or two

00:34:10.016 --> 00:34:11.746 A:middle
tests that show that the timer

00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:12.676 A:middle
delay works properly.

00:34:13.106 --> 00:34:14.366 A:middle
And, for the rest of the class,

00:34:14.366 --> 00:34:16.206 A:middle
I can call the show next place

00:34:16.206 --> 00:34:17.735 A:middle
method directly and not need to

00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:22.416 A:middle
mock a timer scheduler at all.

00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:23.795 A:middle
While we're on the topic of text

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:25.606 A:middle
execution speed, we had a couple

00:34:25.606 --> 00:34:26.335 A:middle
of other tips to share.

00:34:27.755 --> 00:34:29.116 A:middle
One area we've seen concerns the

00:34:29.116 --> 00:34:31.076 A:middle
use of NSPredicateExpectations.

00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:33.036 A:middle
We wanted to mention that these

00:34:33.036 --> 00:34:34.585 A:middle
are not nearly as performant as

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:36.556 A:middle
other expectation classes, since

00:34:36.556 --> 00:34:37.846 A:middle
they rely on polar rather than

00:34:37.846 --> 00:34:39.696 A:middle
more direct callback mechanisms.

00:34:40.576 --> 00:34:42.286 A:middle
They're mainly used in UI tests,

00:34:42.565 --> 00:34:43.485 A:middle
where the conditions being

00:34:43.485 --> 00:34:45.005 A:middle
evaluated are happening in

00:34:45.005 --> 00:34:45.846 A:middle
another process.

00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:47.916 A:middle
So, in your unit tests, we

00:34:47.916 --> 00:34:48.985 A:middle
recommend more direct

00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:50.896 A:middle
mechanisms, such as regular

00:34:50.896 --> 00:34:52.166 A:middle
XCTestExpectations,

00:34:52.616 --> 00:34:54.016 A:middle
NSNotification, or

00:34:54.016 --> 00:34:55.295 A:middle
KVOExpectations.

00:34:57.756 --> 00:34:59.956 A:middle
Another testing speed tip is to

00:34:59.956 --> 00:35:01.346 A:middle
ensure that your app launches as
