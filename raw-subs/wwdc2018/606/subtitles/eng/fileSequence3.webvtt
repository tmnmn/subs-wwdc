00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
techniques tend to produce

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.346 A:middle
uniformly soft shadows.

00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:05.376 A:middle
With the Ray Tracer we can

00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:06.646 A:middle
directly compute whether or not

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:08.306 A:middle
a point if in shadow.

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:09.766 A:middle
So, we can produce clean

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:11.756 A:middle
shadows, including realistic

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:13.246 A:middle
transitions from hard to soft

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:14.996 A:middle
shadows as the distance between

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:15.946 A:middle
objects increases.

00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:19.546 A:middle
One final example is global

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:20.736 A:middle
elimination.

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:23.526 A:middle
This simulates light bouncing of

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:24.806 A:middle
off surfaces in the scene.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.526 A:middle
Global elimination can be very

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:28.586 A:middle
difficult to model with the

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:29.256 A:middle
rasterizer.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:30.946 A:middle
But it's actually modeled quite

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:32.306 A:middle
naturally with the Ray Tracer.

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:34.716 A:middle
In fact, many games and real

00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:36.146 A:middle
time applications that include a

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:37.566 A:middle
global elimination component,

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:39.596 A:middle
actually, precompute it using a

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:41.446 A:middle
Ray Tracer and store the result

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:42.306 A:middle
into textures.

00:03:42.606 --> 00:03:43.816 A:middle
Which are then mapped back onto

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.076 A:middle
the geometry at run time.

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:48.746 A:middle
Of course, there are many other

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:49.796 A:middle
effects that we can simulate

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.216 A:middle
with the Ray Tracer, such as

00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:53.176 A:middle
ambient occlusion, refraction,

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.576 A:middle
and area light sources.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:56.576 A:middle
As well as camera effects, such

00:03:56.576 --> 00:03:57.836 A:middle
as depth of field and motion

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:58.076 A:middle
blur.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.616 A:middle
This makes Ray Tracing the
