00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:01.676 A:middle
triangle we hit, we can end the

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:03.086 A:middle
intersection search as soon as

00:20:03.086 --> 00:20:03.976 A:middle
we hit any triangle.

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.466 A:middle
This is, typically, much faster

00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.546 A:middle
than searching for the closest

00:20:07.546 --> 00:20:08.206 A:middle
intersection.

00:20:09.186 --> 00:20:10.926 A:middle
MPS has a special mode for this,

00:20:11.056 --> 00:20:12.786 A:middle
which we can turn on by passing

00:20:12.786 --> 00:20:14.906 A:middle
the any intersectionType instead

00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:17.936 A:middle
of nearest.

00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:19.936 A:middle
Finally, we can launch our last

00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:21.386 A:middle
kernel, which will add the color

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.756 A:middle
to the image.

00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:25.886 A:middle
Each thread will read in one

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:27.906 A:middle
shadow ray and the corresponding

00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:28.756 A:middle
intersection data.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.526 A:middle
If the intersection distance was

00:20:31.566 --> 00:20:33.216 A:middle
positive, then the original

00:20:33.216 --> 00:20:34.286 A:middle
intersection point was in

00:20:34.286 --> 00:20:34.796 A:middle
shadow.

00:20:35.156 --> 00:20:36.456 A:middle
So, there's nothing more to do.

00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:38.616 A:middle
Otherwise, the intersection

00:20:38.616 --> 00:20:39.766 A:middle
point wasn't in shadow.

00:20:40.716 --> 00:20:42.396 A:middle
So, we should read in the ray

00:20:42.396 --> 00:20:43.896 A:middle
color and write it into the

00:20:43.896 --> 00:20:44.546 A:middle
output image.

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:46.936 A:middle
And that's all we need to do to

00:20:46.936 --> 00:20:48.096 A:middle
add shadows to our image.

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:52.016 A:middle
We can see that each shaded

00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:53.476 A:middle
point is now checking whether or

00:20:53.476 --> 00:20:54.826 A:middle
not the light source is visible

00:20:54.826 --> 00:20:56.136 A:middle
before adding the lighting to

00:20:56.136 --> 00:20:56.616 A:middle
the image.

00:20:57.626 --> 00:20:59.056 A:middle
Because we're using a ray tracer

00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:01.026 A:middle
we can, also, randomly sample
