00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.396 A:middle
This will result in a noisy

00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:03.366 A:middle
image but we can average the

00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:04.826 A:middle
results together over multiple

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:05.316 A:middle
frames.

00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:07.446 A:middle
Each frame will, also, generate

00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:09.386 A:middle
its own set of primary rays, so

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:10.616 A:middle
this, also, gives us the

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:12.046 A:middle
opportunity to implement camera

00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:13.446 A:middle
effects such as depth of field

00:07:13.446 --> 00:07:14.176 A:middle
and motion blur.

00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:17.536 A:middle
So, let's translate this all

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:18.346 A:middle
into a diagram.

00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:21.286 A:middle
First, we'll generate primary

00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:21.616 A:middle
rays.

00:07:22.346 --> 00:07:23.476 A:middle
Then, we'll find the

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.686 A:middle
intersections with the scene.

00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:27.606 A:middle
Then, we'll compute shading at

00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:28.676 A:middle
the intersection points.

00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:30.086 A:middle
And remember, that this is an

00:07:30.086 --> 00:07:31.546 A:middle
iterative process, which will

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.046 A:middle
generate additional shadow and

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:34.616 A:middle
secondary rays, which will be

00:07:34.616 --> 00:07:35.566 A:middle
intersected with the scene,

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:36.006 A:middle
again.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:37.946 A:middle
And finally, we'll write the

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:39.366 A:middle
shaded color into our image.

00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:42.036 A:middle
So, this is describing a

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:43.126 A:middle
rendering application.

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:44.746 A:middle
But a significant fraction of

00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:46.526 A:middle
the time is, actually, spent on

00:07:46.526 --> 00:07:47.606 A:middle
ray triangle intersection

00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:48.126 A:middle
testing.

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:50.556 A:middle
This means that the performance

00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:52.306 A:middle
of the intersector has a huge

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:53.826 A:middle
impact on the overall rendering

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:55.246 A:middle
performance, even though, it has

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:56.376 A:middle
nothing to do with the actual

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:57.336 A:middle
lighting and shading.

00:07:58.496 --> 00:08:00.066 A:middle
This core intersection problem
