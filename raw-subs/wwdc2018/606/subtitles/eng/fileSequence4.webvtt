00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.616 A:middle
This makes Ray Tracing the

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:01.586 A:middle
method of choice for

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:03.596 A:middle
photorealistic offline rendering

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:04.346 A:middle
applications.

00:04:05.886 --> 00:04:07.366 A:middle
The tradeoff is that Ray Tracing

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:08.376 A:middle
is significantly more

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:09.766 A:middle
computationally expensive than

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:11.476 A:middle
rasterization because we're

00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:12.506 A:middle
doing so much more work to

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:13.526 A:middle
simulate these effects.

00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:16.226 A:middle
So, let's first take a closer

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:17.606 A:middle
look at how rendering works with

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:18.956 A:middle
the Ray Tracer, and then we'll

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
see how we can accelerate is

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:20.786 A:middle
with METAL.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.606 A:middle
So, we use an algorithm called

00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:25.436 A:middle
Path Tracing.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.856 A:middle
In the real world, photons are

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:29.696 A:middle
emitted from light sources and

00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:30.886 A:middle
they bounce around until they

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:32.586 A:middle
enter the camera or your eye.

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:35.176 A:middle
But most of those photons

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:36.486 A:middle
actually never make it to the

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:36.866 A:middle
camera.

00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:38.326 A:middle
So, this would be very

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:39.466 A:middle
inefficient to simulate.

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:42.516 A:middle
Fortunately, due to properties

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.116 A:middle
of light we can, actually, work

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:45.476 A:middle
backwards, starting from the

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:45.866 A:middle
camera.

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:49.536 A:middle
We start by casting primary rays

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.816 A:middle
from the camera into the scene.

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:54.886 A:middle
We then compute shading at the

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:55.776 A:middle
intersection points.

00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:58.256 A:middle
Shading consists of figuring out

00:04:58.296 --> 00:04:59.896 A:middle
how much light is arriving at

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:01.556 A:middle
the shading point and what
