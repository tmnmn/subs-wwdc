00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
intersections between those rays

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.276 A:middle
and the scene, using the

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:02.966 A:middle
intersector.

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:05.506 A:middle
And finally, we'll use the

00:12:05.506 --> 00:12:07.136 A:middle
intersection results to compute

00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:07.656 A:middle
shading.

00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:09.876 A:middle
So, let's start with the

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:10.506 A:middle
intersector.

00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:14.556 A:middle
The MPSRayIntersector class

00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:15.806 A:middle
coordinates all of the ray

00:12:15.806 --> 00:12:17.186 A:middle
triangle intersection testing.

00:12:18.256 --> 00:12:19.736 A:middle
All we need to do to create one

00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:21.136 A:middle
is provide the METAL device that

00:12:21.136 --> 00:12:22.436 A:middle
we want to use for intersection

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:22.806 A:middle
testing.

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:26.106 A:middle
Next, we'll create the

00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:27.156 A:middle
acceleration structure.

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.416 A:middle
This is represented by the

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.966 A:middle
MPSTriangleAccelerationStructure

00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:32.366 A:middle
class.

00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:34.306 A:middle
Again, all we need to do to

00:12:34.306 --> 00:12:35.936 A:middle
create one is provide the same

00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:37.196 A:middle
METAL device we used to create

00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:37.926 A:middle
the intersector.

00:12:38.536 --> 00:12:41.716 A:middle
We then, attach our vertexBuffer

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:43.186 A:middle
and specify the triangleCount.

00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:45.786 A:middle
And finally, we build the

00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:46.846 A:middle
acceleration structure.

00:12:47.536 --> 00:12:48.986 A:middle
We only need to do this once.

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:50.066 A:middle
And then, we can reuse the

00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.746 A:middle
acceleration structure as many

00:12:51.746 --> 00:12:52.536 A:middle
times as we'd like.

00:12:56.616 --> 00:12:57.976 A:middle
So next, we'll generate primary

00:12:57.976 --> 00:12:59.386 A:middle
rays and write them into our ray

00:12:59.386 --> 00:12:59.796 A:middle
buffer.
