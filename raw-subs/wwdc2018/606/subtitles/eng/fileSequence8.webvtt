00:07:58.496 --> 00:08:00.066 A:middle
This core intersection problem

00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:01.716 A:middle
is, also, common to all Ray

00:08:01.716 --> 00:08:02.766 A:middle
Tracing applications.

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:06.026 A:middle
So, we decided to solve this

00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:07.456 A:middle
core intersection problem for

00:08:07.456 --> 00:08:09.176 A:middle
you, so that you can start with

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:10.766 A:middle
a high performance intersector

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:12.556 A:middle
and just focus on the details of

00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:12.996 A:middle
you app.

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:16.576 A:middle
So, this year, we're introducing

00:08:16.576 --> 00:08:18.276 A:middle
the MPSRayIntersector API.

00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:21.306 A:middle
This is an API which accelerates

00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:22.386 A:middle
ray triangle intersection

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:25.136 A:middle
testing on the GPU on all of our

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.786 A:middle
macOS and iOS devices.

00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:29.626 A:middle
We wanted to make it easy to

00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:30.806 A:middle
integrate his into existing

00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:32.676 A:middle
apps, so we simply take in rays

00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:33.606 A:middle
through a METAL buffer.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:35.966 A:middle
MPS will find the closest

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:38.035 A:middle
intersection along each ray and

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:39.166 A:middle
return the results in another

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:39.796 A:middle
METAL buffer.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.885 A:middle
All you need to do is provide a

00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:44.326 A:middle
METAL command buffer at the

00:08:44.326 --> 00:08:45.566 A:middle
point in your application where

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:46.436 A:middle
you'd like to perform

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:47.426 A:middle
intersection testing.

00:08:47.826 --> 00:08:49.016 A:middle
And we'll encode all of the

00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:50.096 A:middle
intersection work into the

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.126 A:middle
command buffer for you.

00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:53.936 A:middle
So, let's take a closer look at

00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:54.796 A:middle
the problem that we're trying to

00:08:54.796 --> 00:08:55.156 A:middle
solve.

00:08:55.816 --> 00:09:02.916 A:middle
Oh. Okay. So, 3D models are,
