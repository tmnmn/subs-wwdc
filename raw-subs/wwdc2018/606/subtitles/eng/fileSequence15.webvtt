00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:01.016 A:middle
can compute the intersection

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:01.346 A:middle
point.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.776 A:middle
Remember that a ray is defined

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:06.306 A:middle
by its origin and direction.

00:15:07.736 --> 00:15:11.096 A:middle
This is the intersection struct

00:15:11.226 --> 00:15:12.066 A:middle
returned to us by the

00:15:12.066 --> 00:15:12.666 A:middle
intersector.

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:15.186 A:middle
The distance field will tell us

00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:16.726 A:middle
how far we would need to go in

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:18.396 A:middle
the ray direction to get from

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:19.456 A:middle
the ray origin to the

00:15:19.456 --> 00:15:20.386 A:middle
intersection point.

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:21.946 A:middle
And this distance will be

00:15:21.946 --> 00:15:23.276 A:middle
negative if the ray doesn't

00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:24.166 A:middle
intersect anything.

00:15:25.396 --> 00:15:28.086 A:middle
The primitiveIndex tells us

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:29.096 A:middle
which triangle we hit.

00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:31.526 A:middle
And the last field is what we'll

00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:32.886 A:middle
use to interpolate vertex

00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:33.496 A:middle
attributes.

00:15:34.776 --> 00:15:36.566 A:middle
This field contains the first

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:38.356 A:middle
barycentric coordinates called U

00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:38.796 A:middle
and V.

00:15:39.036 --> 00:15:40.476 A:middle
And these correspond to the

00:15:40.476 --> 00:15:41.676 A:middle
location of the intersection

00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:43.436 A:middle
point relative to the vertices

00:15:43.436 --> 00:15:44.076 A:middle
of the triangle.

00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:46.426 A:middle
There are, actually, three

00:15:46.426 --> 00:15:47.926 A:middle
barycentric coordinates, but

00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:48.836 A:middle
they add up to one.

00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:50.316 A:middle
So, we can compute the third

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:52.706 A:middle
coordinate W by subtracting the

00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:53.706 A:middle
first two from one.

00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:56.916 A:middle
If we have a vertex attribute

00:15:56.986 --> 00:15:58.356 A:middle
defined at each vertex of our

00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.296 A:middle
triangle, then the interpolated
