00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:00.126 A:middle
different GPU.

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:03.136 A:middle
So, here's a quick look at how

00:29:03.136 --> 00:29:03.766 A:middle
to set this up.

00:29:04.556 --> 00:29:06.266 A:middle
First, we create our buffer on

00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:07.976 A:middle
device A, using METAL shared

00:29:07.976 --> 00:29:08.616 A:middle
storage mode.

00:29:08.896 --> 00:29:11.036 A:middle
And this allocates system

00:29:11.036 --> 00:29:11.916 A:middle
memory, internally.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.786 A:middle
And we can get appointed to it

00:29:13.896 --> 00:29:15.196 A:middle
using the .contents method.

00:29:15.736 --> 00:29:19.646 A:middle
We, then create a buffer on

00:29:19.646 --> 00:29:22.596 A:middle
device B using the NoCopy API to

00:29:22.596 --> 00:29:23.706 A:middle
wrap the memory that we just

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:25.606 A:middle
allocated to buffer A.

00:29:26.726 --> 00:29:28.096 A:middle
Now, something to be aware of

00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:30.116 A:middle
for this API is that the buffer

00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:31.686 A:middle
needs to be a multiple of page

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:31.976 A:middle
size.

00:29:31.976 --> 00:29:33.626 A:middle
So, you'll need to pad the

00:29:33.626 --> 00:29:34.626 A:middle
length when you create the

00:29:34.626 --> 00:29:35.186 A:middle
original buffer.

00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:39.996 A:middle
So, now that we're able to share

00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:41.686 A:middle
memory between devices we need

00:29:41.686 --> 00:29:42.966 A:middle
to think about synchronization.

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:45.286 A:middle
Now, to help with this we have

00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:46.746 A:middle
an example timeline here to help

00:29:46.746 --> 00:29:48.356 A:middle
us visualize two GPUs running in

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:48.776 A:middle
parallel.

00:29:49.206 --> 00:29:51.156 A:middle
The dark boxes represent command

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.096 A:middle
buffers and the green boxes

00:29:53.096 --> 00:29:54.046 A:middle
represent work that we've

00:29:54.046 --> 00:29:55.416 A:middle
encoded into those command

00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:55.806 A:middle
buffers.

00:29:56.266 --> 00:29:57.766 A:middle
For example, using a compute

00:29:57.766 --> 00:29:58.476 A:middle
command encoder.

00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:01.966 A:middle
So, the GPU at the top there, is
