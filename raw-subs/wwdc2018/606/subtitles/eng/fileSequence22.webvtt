00:22:01.076 --> 00:22:03.646 A:middle
And finally, we'll multiply the

00:22:03.646 --> 00:22:04.936 A:middle
ray color by the interpolated

00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:05.676 A:middle
vertex color.

00:22:06.906 --> 00:22:07.916 A:middle
This will cause the light to

00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:09.406 A:middle
take on the color of whatever

00:22:09.406 --> 00:22:10.806 A:middle
surface it bounces off of.

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:13.326 A:middle
In a more advanced application,

00:22:13.506 --> 00:22:14.546 A:middle
this would be a much more

00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:15.926 A:middle
complicated calculation.

00:22:16.406 --> 00:22:17.616 A:middle
But by choosing the random ray

00:22:17.616 --> 00:22:19.196 A:middle
directions, carefully, we can

00:22:19.196 --> 00:22:20.076 A:middle
actually get the rest of the

00:22:20.076 --> 00:22:21.306 A:middle
math to cancel out.

00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:23.666 A:middle
And this works even though we're

00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:24.606 A:middle
working backwards from the

00:22:24.606 --> 00:22:26.366 A:middle
camera as long as we're careful

00:22:26.366 --> 00:22:28.196 A:middle
to tint the direct lighting by

00:22:28.196 --> 00:22:29.166 A:middle
the ray color at each

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:29.976 A:middle
intersection point.

00:22:30.526 --> 00:22:32.736 A:middle
So, that's all we need to do for

00:22:32.736 --> 00:22:33.496 A:middle
secondary rays.

00:22:34.756 --> 00:22:36.446 A:middle
So, we can see that light has

00:22:36.446 --> 00:22:37.506 A:middle
started to bounce off of the

00:22:37.506 --> 00:22:39.256 A:middle
walls and onto the sides of the

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:40.426 A:middle
boxes and ceiling.

00:22:40.996 --> 00:22:43.396 A:middle
So, that's it for our example

00:22:43.686 --> 00:22:44.596 A:middle
app.

00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:46.026 A:middle
We started by getting an image

00:22:46.026 --> 00:22:48.076 A:middle
on screen with primary rays and

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:48.596 A:middle
shading.

00:22:49.696 --> 00:22:50.866 A:middle
Then, we added shadows.

00:22:51.376 --> 00:22:53.266 A:middle
And finally, we simulated light

00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:54.256 A:middle
bouncing around the scene with

00:22:54.256 --> 00:22:55.046 A:middle
secondary rays.

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:58.246 A:middle
So, let's switch to the demo and

00:22:58.246 --> 00:22:59.226 A:middle
take a look at this running

00:22:59.226 --> 00:22:59.536 A:middle
live.
