00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:01.026 A:middle
we can, also, randomly sample

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.336 A:middle
the surface of the light source,

00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:03.766 A:middle
which gives us these nice soft

00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:04.236 A:middle
shadows.

00:21:06.756 --> 00:21:09.156 A:middle
So last, we'll look at secondary

00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:09.926 A:middle
rays.

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.626 A:middle
Remember that secondary rays

00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:14.136 A:middle
simulate light bouncing around

00:21:14.136 --> 00:21:14.636 A:middle
the scene.

00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:16.666 A:middle
All we need to do to add

00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:18.626 A:middle
secondary rays is move all of

00:21:18.626 --> 00:21:19.716 A:middle
our kernels into a loop.

00:21:20.136 --> 00:21:21.986 A:middle
In each iteration we'll choose a

00:21:21.986 --> 00:21:23.966 A:middle
new random direction to continue

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:24.656 A:middle
they ray's path.

00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:31.716 A:middle
So, modify the shading kernel to

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:33.206 A:middle
produce the rays for the next

00:21:33.406 --> 00:21:34.066 A:middle
iteration.

00:21:35.206 --> 00:21:36.356 A:middle
Once we finish updating our

00:21:36.356 --> 00:21:38.536 A:middle
image we can simply loop back to

00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:39.896 A:middle
the first intersection test.

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:41.946 A:middle
And we can repeat this loop

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:43.486 A:middle
however many times we want rays

00:21:43.486 --> 00:21:44.046 A:middle
to bounce.

00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:48.506 A:middle
So, let's look at the changes to

00:21:48.506 --> 00:21:49.236 A:middle
the shading kernel.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:53.946 A:middle
In each iteration we'll move the

00:21:53.946 --> 00:21:55.366 A:middle
ray origin to the intersection

00:21:55.366 --> 00:21:55.686 A:middle
point.

00:21:56.256 --> 00:21:58.536 A:middle
We'll then, choose a random

00:21:58.536 --> 00:21:59.916 A:middle
direction to continue the path.
