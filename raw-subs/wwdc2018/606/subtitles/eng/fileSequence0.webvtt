00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:24.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.716 A:middle
My name is Sean James and I'm a

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:27.806 A:middle
GPU Software Engineer.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:30.096 A:middle
Today, I'm going to talk about

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:30.766 A:middle
Ray Tracing.

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:32.426 A:middle
So, you may have seen our Ray

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:33.966 A:middle
Tracing demo in the State of the

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.636 A:middle
Union and want to learn more.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.706 A:middle
Or you may be interested in

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:38.956 A:middle
using Ray Tracing in your own

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:39.376 A:middle
apps.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.746 A:middle
Today, I'll talk about how you

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:43.026 A:middle
can use Ray Tracing in your

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.816 A:middle
applications and how you can

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:47.036 A:middle
accelerate it on the GPU using

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:47.386 A:middle
METAL.

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.116 A:middle
Specifically, using METAL

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.036 A:middle
Performance Shaders.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.956 A:middle
METAL Performance Shaders is a

00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:55.546 A:middle
collection of GPU Compute

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:57.476 A:middle
Primitives optimized for all of

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.546 A:middle
our iOS and macOS devices.
