00:17:00.906 --> 00:17:02.106 A:middle
To do this we can cast

00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:03.976 A:middle
additional shadow rays from the

00:17:04.026 --> 00:17:05.296 A:middle
intersection points towards the

00:17:05.296 --> 00:17:05.996 A:middle
light source.

00:17:07.175 --> 00:17:08.965 A:middle
If a shadow ray doesn't make it

00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:10.156 A:middle
all the way to the light source,

00:17:10.215 --> 00:17:11.626 A:middle
then the original shaded point

00:17:11.626 --> 00:17:12.306 A:middle
wasn't shadow.

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:13.796 A:middle
So, we shouldn't add its color

00:17:13.796 --> 00:17:14.415 A:middle
to the image.

00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:19.106 A:middle
We'll modify our shading kernel

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:21.185 A:middle
to write out additional shadow

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:22.695 A:middle
rays into another METAL buffer.

00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:25.445 A:middle
We'll then, find the

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.486 A:middle
intersections with the scene,

00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:26.935 A:middle
again.

00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:29.366 A:middle
And then, we'll launch one final

00:17:29.366 --> 00:17:30.996 A:middle
kernel which will conditionally

00:17:30.996 --> 00:17:32.466 A:middle
write the shaded color into the

00:17:32.466 --> 00:17:34.136 A:middle
image based on whether or not

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.216 A:middle
the shadow rays intersect at

00:17:35.216 --> 00:17:35.486 A:middle
anything.

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.116 A:middle
So, let's start with the changes

00:17:38.116 --> 00:17:38.946 A:middle
to the shading kernel.

00:17:39.546 --> 00:17:42.106 A:middle
Now, shadow rays are a little

00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:43.366 A:middle
different than primary rays.

00:17:43.886 --> 00:17:45.876 A:middle
First, we need to provide a

00:17:45.876 --> 00:17:48.096 A:middle
maximum intersection distance so

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:49.166 A:middle
that our shadow rays don't

00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:50.306 A:middle
overshoot the light source.

00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:54.106 A:middle
We also don't need to know which

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.396 A:middle
triangle we hit or what the

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:56.666 A:middle
barycentric coordinates were.

00:17:57.016 --> 00:17:58.146 A:middle
So, there are some optimizations

00:17:58.146 --> 00:17:58.576 A:middle
we can do.

00:17:58.886 --> 00:18:01.876 A:middle
And finally, remember that we
