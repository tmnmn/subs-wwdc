00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:05.106 A:middle
So, here's the application we

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:06.796 A:middle
just wrote up and running on the

00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:08.546 A:middle
12.9-inch iPad Pro.

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.736 A:middle
We've, actually, extended this

00:23:10.736 --> 00:23:12.656 A:middle
application to support more

00:23:12.656 --> 00:23:14.366 A:middle
advanced lighting, shading,

00:23:14.366 --> 00:23:15.486 A:middle
textures, and more.

00:23:16.126 --> 00:23:17.326 A:middle
So, let's switch to a more

00:23:17.326 --> 00:23:19.326 A:middle
complicated scene, which used

00:23:19.326 --> 00:23:20.236 A:middle
many of these features.

00:23:26.046 --> 00:23:27.296 A:middle
Here's the Amazon Lumberyard

00:23:27.296 --> 00:23:29.086 A:middle
Bistro scene you saw running in

00:23:29.086 --> 00:23:31.146 A:middle
the State of the Union on four

00:23:31.146 --> 00:23:31.836 A:middle
GPUs.

00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:34.346 A:middle
The scene has almost one million

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:34.976 A:middle
triangles.

00:23:35.506 --> 00:23:36.516 A:middle
But, even with these advanced

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:37.736 A:middle
lighting and shading techniques

00:23:38.096 --> 00:23:39.346 A:middle
we're still able to achieve

00:23:39.346 --> 00:23:40.666 A:middle
almost 20 million rays per

00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:41.916 A:middle
second on an iPad Pro.

00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:43.216 A:middle
And that's a combined

00:23:43.216 --> 00:23:45.046 A:middle
measurement including primary,

00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:46.636 A:middle
shadow, and secondary rays.

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:49.676 A:middle
So, we've created what we think

00:23:49.956 --> 00:23:51.986 A:middle
is an easy to use API that you

00:23:51.986 --> 00:23:53.276 A:middle
can use to start implementing

00:23:53.276 --> 00:23:54.296 A:middle
these types of applications

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:54.696 A:middle
today.

00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:57.166 A:middle
So, that's if for our demo, for

00:23:57.166 --> 00:23:57.416 A:middle
now.

00:23:58.766 --> 00:23:59.546 A:middle
Thank you.
