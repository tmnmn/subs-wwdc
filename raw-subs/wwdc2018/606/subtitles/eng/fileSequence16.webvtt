00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.296 A:middle
triangle, then the interpolated

00:16:00.296 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
vertex attribute is just the sum

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:05.466 A:middle
of the attributes at each vertex

00:16:05.696 --> 00:16:06.876 A:middle
weighted by the barycentric

00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:07.396 A:middle
coordinates.

00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.766 A:middle
For example, if we have a color

00:16:09.766 --> 00:16:11.466 A:middle
defined at each vertex, then the

00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:13.226 A:middle
interpolated color is just the

00:16:13.226 --> 00:16:14.526 A:middle
weighted sum of the colors at

00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:15.176 A:middle
each vertex.

00:16:15.846 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
So, at this point we've created

00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:21.296 A:middle
a ray intersector and an

00:16:21.296 --> 00:16:22.396 A:middle
acceleration structure.

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:25.226 A:middle
We then, generated primary rays

00:16:25.756 --> 00:16:26.846 A:middle
and found the intersections with

00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:27.356 A:middle
the scene.

00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:29.456 A:middle
We computed shading at the

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:30.736 A:middle
intersection points, and then

00:16:30.736 --> 00:16:32.156 A:middle
wrote the shaded color into our

00:16:32.156 --> 00:16:32.536 A:middle
image.

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:33.736 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:16:33.736 --> 00:16:34.176 A:middle
image.

00:16:34.736 --> 00:16:37.156 A:middle
We can see the geometry

00:16:37.156 --> 00:16:38.506 A:middle
represented by the acceleration

00:16:38.506 --> 00:16:39.906 A:middle
structure, as well as the

00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:41.486 A:middle
interpolated vertex colors and

00:16:41.486 --> 00:16:42.586 A:middle
lighting we just computed.

00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:44.736 A:middle
Now that we have an image on

00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:46.186 A:middle
screen we're ready to add some

00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:46.926 A:middle
additional effects.

00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:49.796 A:middle
So, we'll start by adding

00:16:49.796 --> 00:16:50.896 A:middle
shadows to our image.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:55.376 A:middle
To do this, we need to check if

00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:57.406 A:middle
the light can actually reach the

00:16:57.406 --> 00:16:59.126 A:middle
shading point before adding it

00:16:59.126 --> 00:16:59.746 A:middle
to the image.
