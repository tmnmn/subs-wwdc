00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.356 A:middle
So, this is the main way that we

00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:01.346 A:middle
speed up ray triangle

00:10:01.346 --> 00:10:01.996 A:middle
intersection.

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:04.876 A:middle
Of course, this is a simplified

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:05.386 A:middle
example.

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:07.846 A:middle
In a real scene the acceleration

00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:08.906 A:middle
structure can be quite a bit

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:09.646 A:middle
more complicated.

00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:12.236 A:middle
We can see from this

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.566 A:middle
visualization that the

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:14.756 A:middle
acceleration structure is

00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:16.176 A:middle
adapting to the complexity of

00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:16.866 A:middle
the geometry.

00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:19.106 A:middle
This means that we spend most of

00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:20.356 A:middle
our time searching for

00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:22.226 A:middle
intersections only in areas of

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:24.226 A:middle
high geometric complexity, which

00:10:24.226 --> 00:10:24.926 A:middle
is what we want.

00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:27.586 A:middle
Now, I'm describing this to give

00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:29.486 A:middle
you an intuition for what the

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:31.086 A:middle
acceleration structure is and

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:31.816 A:middle
how it works.

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:33.436 A:middle
But you, actually, don't need to

00:10:33.436 --> 00:10:34.546 A:middle
worry about this, too much,

00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:36.116 A:middle
because MPS will take care of

00:10:36.116 --> 00:10:36.806 A:middle
all of this for you.

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:39.976 A:middle
Remember that we'll model our

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:41.316 A:middle
scene using triangles.

00:10:41.686 --> 00:10:42.756 A:middle
And those triangles will

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:43.986 A:middle
themselves be represented by

00:10:43.986 --> 00:10:45.656 A:middle
vertices in a vertex buffer.

00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:48.616 A:middle
All you need to do is call MPS

00:10:48.616 --> 00:10:50.416 A:middle
to build an acceleration

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.506 A:middle
structure from your vertex

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:51.896 A:middle
buffer.

00:10:52.576 --> 00:10:54.286 A:middle
When you're ready to search for

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:55.666 A:middle
intersections, you simply

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:56.786 A:middle
provide this acceleration

00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:57.626 A:middle
structure back to the

00:10:57.626 --> 00:10:58.256 A:middle
intersector.

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:00.646 A:middle
So, let's see how we can use
