00:32:59.456 --> 00:33:02.186 A:middle
And the way we do this is we

00:33:02.186 --> 00:33:03.846 A:middle
store the host time when each

00:33:03.846 --> 00:33:04.776 A:middle
command buffer completion

00:33:04.776 --> 00:33:05.456 A:middle
handler was called.

00:33:05.526 --> 00:33:07.366 A:middle
And if you do this for every

00:33:07.366 --> 00:33:09.256 A:middle
command buffer, you can then use

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:10.346 A:middle
the differences between these

00:33:10.346 --> 00:33:11.456 A:middle
times to figure out how long the

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:12.376 A:middle
GPU was running for.

00:33:13.416 --> 00:33:15.976 A:middle
So, for example, to estimate how

00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:17.106 A:middle
long the three command buffers

00:33:17.106 --> 00:33:19.096 A:middle
shown here took execute, we've

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:20.266 A:middle
measured the time between the

00:33:20.266 --> 00:33:21.386 A:middle
completion handler was called

00:33:21.386 --> 00:33:23.356 A:middle
for command buffer 3 and command

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:23.816 A:middle
buffer 0.

00:33:25.276 --> 00:33:27.996 A:middle
So, that's the theory.

00:33:28.286 --> 00:33:29.586 A:middle
And now, let's see it in action.

00:33:42.126 --> 00:33:42.326 A:middle
All right.

00:33:42.326 --> 00:33:43.436 A:middle
So, this is the Amazon

00:33:43.436 --> 00:33:44.836 A:middle
Lumberyard Bistro scene that

00:33:44.836 --> 00:33:46.586 A:middle
Sean was showing you earlier.

00:33:47.586 --> 00:33:48.776 A:middle
And this time, it's running on a

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:49.456 A:middle
MacBook Pro.

00:33:49.456 --> 00:33:52.126 A:middle
And you can see in the top left

00:33:52.126 --> 00:33:53.176 A:middle
of the screen here, we have a

00:33:53.176 --> 00:33:54.376 A:middle
rays per second metric.

00:33:54.896 --> 00:33:56.176 A:middle
As you can get an idea for how

00:33:56.176 --> 00:33:56.566 A:middle
it's running.

00:33:57.156 --> 00:33:59.566 A:middle
So, this includes the primary

00:33:59.566 --> 00:34:01.266 A:middle
rays, secondary rays, and the
