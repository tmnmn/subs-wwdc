00:35:58.276 --> 00:36:01.346 A:middle
As you saw from my demos, it's

00:36:01.346 --> 00:36:03.166 A:middle
available on all of our iOS and

00:36:03.166 --> 00:36:04.246 A:middle
macOS platforms.

00:36:04.676 --> 00:36:06.196 A:middle
And it scales really well as you

00:36:06.196 --> 00:36:09.426 A:middle
add multiple GPUs on macOS.

00:36:09.786 --> 00:36:11.386 A:middle
Now, we're really excited to see

00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:12.726 A:middle
how you use Ray Tracing in your

00:36:12.726 --> 00:36:13.466 A:middle
applications.

00:36:14.126 --> 00:36:15.936 A:middle
We used Path Tracing in our

00:36:15.936 --> 00:36:16.636 A:middle
example, today.

00:36:17.116 --> 00:36:18.216 A:middle
But there's also hybrid

00:36:18.216 --> 00:36:18.576 A:middle
rendering.

00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:20.316 A:middle
You might want to incorporate

00:36:20.316 --> 00:36:21.576 A:middle
Ray Tracing to do really nice

00:36:21.576 --> 00:36:22.966 A:middle
looking shadows or ambient

00:36:22.966 --> 00:36:24.246 A:middle
occlusion or reflections.

00:36:25.176 --> 00:36:26.566 A:middle
And there's also non-rendering

00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:27.346 A:middle
in cases.

00:36:27.456 --> 00:36:29.056 A:middle
For example, autosimulation,

00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:30.846 A:middle
physics, AI collisionless

00:36:30.846 --> 00:36:31.196 A:middle
action.

00:36:31.196 --> 00:36:32.246 A:middle
There's a ton of stuff you can

00:36:32.246 --> 00:36:33.226 A:middle
do with this.

00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:37.156 A:middle
So, to help you get started you

00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:40.236 A:middle
can find sample code on

00:36:40.236 --> 00:36:41.596 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:42.896 A:middle
So, be sure to check that out.

00:36:43.476 --> 00:36:45.086 A:middle
Also, the header files are full

00:36:45.086 --> 00:36:47.476 A:middle
of documentation and information

00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:48.966 A:middle
on some additional features that

00:36:48.966 --> 00:36:50.036 A:middle
we weren't able to cover today.

00:36:51.326 --> 00:36:52.696 A:middle
And finally, we have our lab

00:36:52.696 --> 00:36:53.786 A:middle
session tomorrow from 12.

00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:55.736 A:middle
Sean and I will be on hand to

00:36:55.736 --> 00:36:57.436 A:middle
talk more about the API and to

00:36:57.656 --> 00:36:58.796 A:middle
help you get started with Ray

00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:00.086 A:middle
Tracing in your application.
