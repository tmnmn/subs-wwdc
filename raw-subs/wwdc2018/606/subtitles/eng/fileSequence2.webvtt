00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
rendering as an example of how

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.266 A:middle
you can use Ray Tracing in your

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:02.956 A:middle
applications.

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.206 A:middle
So, you may be familiar with the

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.496 A:middle
rasterization pipeline.

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.895 A:middle
The rasterizer works by

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.216 A:middle
projecting one triangle at a

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.686 A:middle
time onto the screen and shading

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:14.796 A:middle
the corresponding pixels.

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:16.876 A:middle
This can be implemented very

00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:19.066 A:middle
quickly in GPU hardware, which

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:20.296 A:middle
makes this the method of choice

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:21.756 A:middle
for games and other real time

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:22.446 A:middle
applications.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.626 A:middle
But the rasterization model

00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:27.356 A:middle
makes it difficult to simulate

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.646 A:middle
certain physical behaviors of

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:28.946 A:middle
light.

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:32.176 A:middle
One example is reflections.

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:34.806 A:middle
With the rasterizer, reflections

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:35.886 A:middle
are, typically, implemented

00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:37.566 A:middle
using approximations, such as

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:38.956 A:middle
cube maps and screen space

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:39.536 A:middle
reflections.

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:41.956 A:middle
But with the Ray Tracer we can

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:43.636 A:middle
compute accurate reflections,

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:44.176 A:middle
directly.

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:47.316 A:middle
Another example is shadows.

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:49.816 A:middle
With the rasterizer, shadows are

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.046 A:middle
typically implemented using

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:51.826 A:middle
shadow maps.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:53.456 A:middle
But these can be tricky to

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:55.066 A:middle
implement without suffering from

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.786 A:middle
aliasing and resolution issues.

00:02:57.756 --> 00:02:59.746 A:middle
Furthermore, soft shadow mapping

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
techniques tend to produce
