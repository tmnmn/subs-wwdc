00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.486 A:middle
can cast secondary rays in

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.596 A:middle
random directions from the

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:03.256 A:middle
shading point.

00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:05.786 A:middle
We then, repeat the shading

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:07.126 A:middle
process at the secondary

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:08.106 A:middle
intersection points.

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:11.046 A:middle
We'll first compute how much

00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:13.176 A:middle
light is arriving directly at

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:14.596 A:middle
the second intersection point

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:16.366 A:middle
and what fraction of that light

00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:17.876 A:middle
is reflected back towards the

00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:19.236 A:middle
previous intersection point.

00:06:19.236 --> 00:06:21.186 A:middle
And, ultimately, back into the

00:06:21.186 --> 00:06:21.616 A:middle
camera.

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:24.186 A:middle
We'll also need to cast another

00:06:24.186 --> 00:06:25.806 A:middle
shadow ray from the secondary

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:26.706 A:middle
intersection point.

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:30.346 A:middle
And we can repeat this process

00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:31.946 A:middle
however many times we'd like to

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:33.836 A:middle
simulate light bouncing around

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:36.336 A:middle
the scene.

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:38.446 A:middle
Now, in order to get these nice

00:06:38.446 --> 00:06:39.906 A:middle
soft shadow and bounced lighting

00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:41.746 A:middle
effects we, actually, need to

00:06:41.746 --> 00:06:43.256 A:middle
cast many shadow and secondary

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:46.326 A:middle
rays per point along the path.

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:47.516 A:middle
This means that the number of

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:48.916 A:middle
rays, actually, grows

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:50.206 A:middle
exponentially with the number of

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:50.716 A:middle
bounces.

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:53.436 A:middle
To avoid this exponential growth

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:55.666 A:middle
we'll, instead, choose just one

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:57.446 A:middle
shadow ray and one secondary ray

00:06:57.446 --> 00:06:58.636 A:middle
direction at each bounce.
