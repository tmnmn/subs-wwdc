00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.346 A:middle
So, don't worry if you didn't

00:24:04.346 --> 00:24:05.896 A:middle
catch all of that because this

00:24:05.896 --> 00:24:07.096 A:middle
application will be available

00:24:07.096 --> 00:24:08.416 A:middle
for download as a sample.

00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:10.086 A:middle
The sample demonstrates

00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:11.106 A:middle
everything I've talked about

00:24:11.106 --> 00:24:11.946 A:middle
today and more.

00:24:12.716 --> 00:24:13.686 A:middle
We recommend that you get

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:14.776 A:middle
started by downloading the

00:24:14.776 --> 00:24:16.246 A:middle
sample and adding your own

00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:18.266 A:middle
geometry, lighting, shading, and

00:24:18.266 --> 00:24:18.716 A:middle
so on.

00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:20.746 A:middle
There's, also, a lot more to the

00:24:20.746 --> 00:24:22.446 A:middle
API that I didn't have time to

00:24:22.446 --> 00:24:23.236 A:middle
talk about, today.

00:24:23.826 --> 00:24:24.766 A:middle
So, we, also, recommend that you

00:24:24.766 --> 00:24:26.296 A:middle
take a look at the documentation

00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:26.776 A:middle
and headers.

00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:29.216 A:middle
And with that, I'll hand it off

00:24:29.216 --> 00:24:30.906 A:middle
to my colleague, Wayne, who will

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:32.086 A:middle
talk about how we can extend

00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:33.366 A:middle
this to multiple GPUs.

00:24:35.396 --> 00:24:35.886 A:middle
Thank you.

Hi, everyone.

00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:49.306 A:middle
So, say you're working on your

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:49.566 A:middle
Mac.

00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:51.996 A:middle
It has an internal GPU.

00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:53.726 A:middle
But you've, also, plugged in a

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:54.666 A:middle
couple or really high

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:56.116 A:middle
performance eGPUs.

00:24:56.586 --> 00:24:58.436 A:middle
And what we'd like to be able to

00:24:58.436 --> 00:25:00.646 A:middle
do is use all of these GPUs
