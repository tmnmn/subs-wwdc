00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:02.736 A:middle
presented in the user's

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:03.646 A:middle
notification list.

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:05.896 A:middle
Then we'll talk about

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:07.546 A:middle
notification content extensions,

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:09.106 A:middle
which are existing extension

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:10.696 A:middle
points with notifications, and

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.226 A:middle
discuss new APIs that you've

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:13.266 A:middle
added around these.

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:15.906 A:middle
Then, we'll cover notification

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:17.816 A:middle
management and talk about all

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.116 A:middle
the new ways in which your

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:20.916 A:middle
application users can now tweak

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:22.636 A:middle
your notification settings and

00:01:22.636 --> 00:01:24.226 A:middle
what you need to do to respond

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.366 A:middle
to these new options.

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:27.976 A:middle
Then, we'll cover provisional

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.936 A:middle
authorization, which allows your

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:31.806 A:middle
applications to have a trial

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:33.706 A:middle
phase for sending notifications

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:35.676 A:middle
to users without their explicit

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:37.366 A:middle
permission but do it quietly.

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.266 A:middle
And lastly, we'll cover critical

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.006 A:middle
alerts, which allows your

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:43.816 A:middle
applications to send important

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.446 A:middle
notifications to the users,

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:47.996 A:middle
which bypass certain system

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:49.846 A:middle
settings if your users allows

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:51.026 A:middle
your applications to do so.

So there's a range of topics to

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.736 A:middle
