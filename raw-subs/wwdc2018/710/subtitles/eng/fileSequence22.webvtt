enhance your user's experience

00:22:01.366 --> 00:22:02.476 A:middle
around your content extensions

00:22:02.546 --> 00:22:03.806 A:middle
and then you start using these

00:22:03.806 --> 00:22:04.096 A:middle
APIs.

00:22:04.096 --> 00:22:06.726 A:middle
So that was notification content

00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:07.276 A:middle
extensions.

00:22:07.866 --> 00:22:09.836 A:middle
Now, the next topic today we're

00:22:09.836 --> 00:22:11.316 A:middle
going to look at is notification

00:22:11.316 --> 00:22:12.986 A:middle
management, and to tell you all

00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:14.376 A:middle
about that, let me invite my

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.576 A:middle
colleague Teja to the stage.

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:15.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:22:16.516 --> 00:22:22.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:23.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Kritarth.

00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:24.946 A:middle
Hi everyone.

00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:27.206 A:middle
My name is Teja Kondapalli, and

00:22:27.206 --> 00:22:29.026 A:middle
I'm also an engineer on the iOS

00:22:29.026 --> 00:22:30.146 A:middle
Notifications' Team.

00:22:30.546 --> 00:22:31.746 A:middle
And, of course, I'm here to talk

00:22:31.796 --> 00:22:33.216 A:middle
to you about a couple of the new

00:22:33.216 --> 00:22:34.396 A:middle
APIs that we have.

00:22:35.126 --> 00:22:36.546 A:middle
The first of which is

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:38.476 A:middle
notification management.

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:40.896 A:middle
But before I dive into this API,

00:22:40.896 --> 00:22:42.916 A:middle
I want to cover some of the user

00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:46.396 A:middle
facing features to give you some

00:22:46.396 --> 00:22:47.776 A:middle
more context and then we can

00:22:47.776 --> 00:22:48.756 A:middle
deep dive into the API.

00:22:53.136 --> 00:22:54.606 A:middle
As our users get more and more

00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:55.546 A:middle
apps on their phones,

00:22:56.026 --> 00:22:57.856 A:middle
notifications become the primary

00:22:57.856 --> 00:22:59.166 A:middle
way that they interact with

00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
these apps.
