00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.146 A:middle
So today the user can launch

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:03.216 A:middle
your application if touches were

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:04.706 A:middle
not allowed by simply tapping

00:18:04.916 --> 00:18:07.126 A:middle
the content extension view.

00:18:08.036 --> 00:18:09.786 A:middle
They could also do so by tapping

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:12.116 A:middle
your application icon in the top

00:18:12.596 --> 00:18:14.126 A:middle
left corner.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:15.966 A:middle
Or you could create a foreground

00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:17.786 A:middle
action, which then would in turn

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:19.266 A:middle
launch the application.

00:18:20.936 --> 00:18:22.926 A:middle
But what if you wanted to do

00:18:22.926 --> 00:18:24.106 A:middle
this from your own custom

00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:24.646 A:middle
control?

00:18:25.986 --> 00:18:27.056 A:middle
What if you wanted to launch the

00:18:27.056 --> 00:18:28.306 A:middle
application programmatically?

00:18:29.206 --> 00:18:30.746 A:middle
To enable this, there is a new

00:18:30.746 --> 00:18:33.136 A:middle
API on the NSExtensionContext

00:18:33.136 --> 00:18:34.656 A:middle
called performNotification

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.476 A:middle
DefaultAction, which would allow

00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:40.936 A:middle
you to do this now.

00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:42.026 A:middle
Now, what does the default

00:18:42.026 --> 00:18:42.546 A:middle
action mean?

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:45.006 A:middle
So, as we said, it launches the

00:18:45.006 --> 00:18:47.046 A:middle
application, but at the same

00:18:47.046 --> 00:18:48.036 A:middle
time, it calls the

00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:49.776 A:middle
UserNotificationCenter did

00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:51.826 A:middle
receive response method in your

00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:52.656 A:middle
application delegate.

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.416 A:middle
Now the UNNotificationResponse

00:18:55.416 --> 00:18:56.876 A:middle
object contains the information

00:18:56.876 --> 00:18:58.316 A:middle
of the notification from which

00:18:58.316 --> 00:19:00.536 A:middle
the user came, so you can update
