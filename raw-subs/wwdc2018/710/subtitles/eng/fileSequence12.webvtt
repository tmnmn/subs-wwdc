00:11:57.646 --> 00:12:00.796 A:middle
completion block to dismiss or

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:02.586 A:middle
dismiss and forward, where we

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:03.896 A:middle
will forward this response to

00:12:03.896 --> 00:12:05.176 A:middle
your AppDelegate function as

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:05.346 A:middle
well.

00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:07.676 A:middle
All right, so now that we set

00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:09.396 A:middle
this up, we can see that when

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.776 A:middle
the user takes the like action,

00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:13.206 A:middle
the content extension content

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:14.276 A:middle
gets updated right there and

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:14.446 A:middle
then.

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:16.516 A:middle
So it's a much more interactive

00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:17.946 A:middle
experience for your user and

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:18.846 A:middle
they're getting real-time

00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:19.886 A:middle
feedback.

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:22.566 A:middle
However, if you look at the

00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:23.966 A:middle
current state of the content

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:26.576 A:middle
extension, we see that there is

00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:28.106 A:middle
some redundant information.

00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:30.526 A:middle
The user has already taken the

00:12:30.526 --> 00:12:32.136 A:middle
like action, so having the

00:12:32.136 --> 00:12:33.506 A:middle
action there doesn't really

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:34.416 A:middle
serve a purpose anymore.

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:38.206 A:middle
Now notification actions, in

00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:39.416 A:middle
general, have certain

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:40.176 A:middle
limitations.

00:12:41.606 --> 00:12:43.506 A:middle
They are not very dynamic and

00:12:43.606 --> 00:12:45.316 A:middle
can't be updated based on the

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
context of your content

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:47.226 A:middle
extensions.

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:51.046 A:middle
Also, these tend to be tied to

00:12:51.046 --> 00:12:52.846 A:middle
the notification categories that

00:12:52.846 --> 00:12:54.336 A:middle
you have to define at the time

00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:55.726 A:middle
of your application setup.

00:12:56.946 --> 00:12:58.526 A:middle
So we wanted to address these

00:12:58.526 --> 00:13:00.396 A:middle
issues and we have introduced a
