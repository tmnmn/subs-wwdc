00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:00.116 A:middle
Firstly, you can handle this

00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:02.206 A:middle
response in the AppDelegate that

00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:03.366 A:middle
is associated with your

00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:05.386 A:middle
application that implements the

00:11:05.386 --> 00:11:07.036 A:middle
UNUserNotificationCenter

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:07.836 A:middle
Delegate protocol.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.716 A:middle
Here, the function

00:11:09.716 --> 00:11:11.206 A:middle
UserNotificationCenter did

00:11:11.206 --> 00:11:12.906 A:middle
receive response, includes the

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:15.496 A:middle
response object which includes

00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:17.176 A:middle
information about the request,

00:11:17.516 --> 00:11:18.716 A:middle
the notification request from

00:11:18.716 --> 00:11:20.046 A:middle
which the user took this action.

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:22.916 A:middle
However, the content extension

00:11:23.176 --> 00:11:24.826 A:middle
also allows you to intercept

00:11:24.946 --> 00:11:26.946 A:middle
this action response so that you

00:11:26.946 --> 00:11:28.906 A:middle
can update your view and make a

00:11:28.906 --> 00:11:30.026 A:middle
much more interactive and

00:11:30.026 --> 00:11:31.906 A:middle
dynamic experience for users for

00:11:31.906 --> 00:11:32.806 A:middle
the content extension.

00:11:33.586 --> 00:11:35.986 A:middle
So for our sample here, we enter

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.506 A:middle
the did receive response method

00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:39.416 A:middle
and checked the action

00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:41.056 A:middle
identifier for the like action.

00:11:42.006 --> 00:11:44.196 A:middle
And then we update our UI with

00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:45.956 A:middle
the new label as well as update

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:46.886 A:middle
our application state.

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:50.146 A:middle
Finally calling the completion

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:51.376 A:middle
block we do not dismiss.

00:11:51.956 --> 00:11:53.266 A:middle
If you do want to dismiss your

00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:54.476 A:middle
content extension view here,

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:56.486 A:middle
then you can simply change the

00:11:56.486 --> 00:11:57.646 A:middle
parameter you're passing to the

00:11:57.646 --> 00:12:00.796 A:middle
completion block to dismiss or
