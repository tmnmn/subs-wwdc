00:31:58.506 --> 00:32:00.226 A:middle
you might be requesting, you can

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:04.366 A:middle
add a dot qualifying option

00:32:04.366 --> 00:32:05.436 A:middle
called .provisional.

00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:09.806 A:middle
And if you include this, you

00:32:10.036 --> 00:32:11.546 A:middle
will automatically start

00:32:11.546 --> 00:32:13.246 A:middle
participating in the trial.

00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:16.126 A:middle
It's really important to note

00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:19.656 A:middle
that the .provisional option is

00:32:19.656 --> 00:32:21.036 A:middle
in addition to whatever other

00:32:21.036 --> 00:32:22.826 A:middle
options you may be providing.

00:32:23.626 --> 00:32:24.796 A:middle
That's because if the users

00:32:24.796 --> 00:32:25.856 A:middle
decide to keep getting your

00:32:25.856 --> 00:32:27.826 A:middle
notifications delivered, we want

00:32:27.826 --> 00:32:28.896 A:middle
to know how you want them

00:32:28.896 --> 00:32:31.736 A:middle
delivered, with badges or sounds

00:32:31.856 --> 00:32:32.536 A:middle
or as alerts.

00:32:33.186 --> 00:32:35.436 A:middle
So that's what provisional

00:32:35.436 --> 00:32:36.386 A:middle
authorization is.

00:32:36.526 --> 00:32:38.236 A:middle
It's an automatic trial of the

00:32:38.236 --> 00:32:40.156 A:middle
notifications from your app to

00:32:40.156 --> 00:32:41.546 A:middle
help your users make a more

00:32:41.546 --> 00:32:43.616 A:middle
informed decision about whether

00:32:43.616 --> 00:32:45.116 A:middle
they want these notifications.

00:32:46.466 --> 00:32:48.366 A:middle
And again, to encourage your

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:49.716 A:middle
users to keep getting your

00:32:49.716 --> 00:32:51.586 A:middle
notifications delivered, it's

00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:53.266 A:middle
really important to make the

00:32:53.266 --> 00:32:55.316 A:middle
content in your notifications

00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:56.066 A:middle
relevant.

00:32:57.226 --> 00:32:59.756 A:middle
And also, it's really important

00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:01.356 A:middle
to use .provisional as a
