00:33:58.156 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
realize that we need a new type

00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:02.556 A:middle
of notification, and this is

00:34:02.556 --> 00:34:04.686 A:middle
what we call critical alerts.

00:34:05.596 --> 00:34:08.025 A:middle
Critical alerts are medical- and

00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:09.626 A:middle
health-related notifications.

00:34:10.706 --> 00:34:12.176 A:middle
Or home- and security-related

00:34:12.176 --> 00:34:13.005 A:middle
notifications.

00:34:14.286 --> 00:34:16.406 A:middle
Or public safety notifications.

00:34:16.766 --> 00:34:18.446 A:middle
And the key to a critical alert

00:34:19.106 --> 00:34:21.616 A:middle
is that it requires the user to

00:34:21.616 --> 00:34:22.976 A:middle
take action immediately.

00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:27.716 A:middle
The way that critical alerts

00:34:27.746 --> 00:34:30.065 A:middle
behave is that they bypass both

00:34:30.166 --> 00:34:31.516 A:middle
do not disturb and the ringer

00:34:31.516 --> 00:34:34.186 A:middle
switch, and they will play a

00:34:34.186 --> 00:34:34.585 A:middle
sound.

00:34:34.726 --> 00:34:35.936 A:middle
And they can even play a custom

00:34:35.936 --> 00:34:36.315 A:middle
sound.

00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:38.616 A:middle
But what that means is that

00:34:38.616 --> 00:34:40.896 A:middle
these are very disruptive, and

00:34:40.896 --> 00:34:42.795 A:middle
for that reason we don't think

00:34:43.106 --> 00:34:44.806 A:middle
that all apps should be able to

00:34:44.806 --> 00:34:46.856 A:middle
send critical notifications.

00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:47.996 A:middle
Critical alerts.

00:34:49.626 --> 00:34:51.266 A:middle
So in order to start sending a

00:34:51.266 --> 00:34:53.096 A:middle
critical alert, you will need to

00:34:53.096 --> 00:34:55.436 A:middle
apply for entitlement, and you

00:34:55.436 --> 00:34:56.315 A:middle
can do that on the

00:34:56.315 --> 00:34:58.176 A:middle
developer.apple website.

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.236 A:middle
This is what a critical alert
