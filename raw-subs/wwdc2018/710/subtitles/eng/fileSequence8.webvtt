00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.416 A:middle
Now, let's move on to the next

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:03.016 A:middle
topic and talk about

00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:04.706 A:middle
notification content extensions.

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:07.466 A:middle
Now, some of you might already

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:08.606 A:middle
be familiar with these content

00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:10.056 A:middle
extensions that we included with

00:08:10.136 --> 00:08:10.716 A:middle
iOS 10.

00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:13.726 A:middle
Content extensions allow your

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.776 A:middle
applications to present a rich

00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:17.686 A:middle
notification view around the

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:20.076 A:middle
user's notifications, so you can

00:08:20.076 --> 00:08:21.996 A:middle
have a much more customized and

00:08:21.996 --> 00:08:23.706 A:middle
interactive interface for the

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:25.596 A:middle
notification that the user is

00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:25.936 A:middle
seeing.

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:28.836 A:middle
Let's do a quick recap of

00:08:28.836 --> 00:08:29.846 A:middle
setting up these content

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:30.436 A:middle
extensions.

00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:32.686 A:middle
Xcode gives you a standard

00:08:32.686 --> 00:08:34.566 A:middle
template to add a target for the

00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:35.746 A:middle
content extensions to your

00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:39.456 A:middle
applications and once you set

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:40.986 A:middle
that up, we create a default

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.306 A:middle
class for the notification view

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:44.476 A:middle
controller, which implements the

00:08:44.476 --> 00:08:46.296 A:middle
UNNotificationContentExtension

00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:46.716 A:middle
protocol.

00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:49.026 A:middle
Here, the did receive

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:51.186 A:middle
notification method is important

00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:52.516 A:middle
because this is your entry point

00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:53.576 A:middle
for setting up the view

00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:55.116 A:middle
associated with the content

00:08:55.116 --> 00:08:57.096 A:middle
extension, and you can use the

00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:59.276 A:middle
notification object past here to

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
get all the information around
