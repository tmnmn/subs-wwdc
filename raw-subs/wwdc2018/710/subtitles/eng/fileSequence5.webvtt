00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.516 A:middle
And then the user can expand a

00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:03.906 A:middle
specific group to see all the

00:05:03.906 --> 00:05:05.356 A:middle
notifications that are part of

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:05.786 A:middle
that group.

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:07.926 A:middle
So by using the thread

00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:09.676 A:middle
identifier, messages is able to

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.276 A:middle
do so.

00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:14.426 A:middle
Now, your application users also

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
have the option of tweaking this

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.636 A:middle
notification grouping setting

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:19.276 A:middle
from your per application

00:05:19.276 --> 00:05:20.526 A:middle
notification setting's page.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:23.216 A:middle
Here, they get three options.

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:25.536 A:middle
If they choose automatic, then

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:26.756 A:middle
they get the behavior that we

00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:27.496 A:middle
just described.

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:30.786 A:middle
However, the user also has the

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.286 A:middle
option of just grouping by

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:34.146 A:middle
application, where the system

00:05:34.146 --> 00:05:35.156 A:middle
will ignore your thread

00:05:35.156 --> 00:05:36.706 A:middle
identifier and group all

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.376 A:middle
notifications into a single

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:39.246 A:middle
group.

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:41.846 A:middle
And if the user wants the same

00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:43.926 A:middle
behavior as it exists in iOS 11

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:45.596 A:middle
today, then they can simply turn

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:46.586 A:middle
off grouping for your

00:05:46.586 --> 00:05:47.806 A:middle
applications' notifications.

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:49.926 A:middle
So do keep this in mind when

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:50.986 A:middle
you're creating your own custom

00:05:50.986 --> 00:05:53.436 A:middle
groups that they create enough

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.486 A:middle
value for users when they

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:56.516 A:middle
receive your applications'

00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:57.246 A:middle
notifications.

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:00.606 A:middle
Now what are the different
