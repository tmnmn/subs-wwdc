00:20:59.836 --> 00:21:01.816 A:middle
If you want to do that then use

00:21:01.816 --> 00:21:04.236 A:middle
the existing API for removing

00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:05.356 A:middle
delivered notifications with

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.696 A:middle
identifiers to get that

00:21:06.696 --> 00:21:07.916 A:middle
functionality.

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:11.296 A:middle
All right, now let's summarize

00:21:11.296 --> 00:21:13.266 A:middle
all the new APIs that we've

00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:14.486 A:middle
looked at today around the

00:21:14.486 --> 00:21:15.926 A:middle
notification content extensions.

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:20.506 A:middle
We started with talking about

00:21:20.506 --> 00:21:22.166 A:middle
notification actions where now

00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:23.356 A:middle
you can access these

00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:25.016 A:middle
notification actions as well as

00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:26.686 A:middle
replace them dynamically from

00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:27.656 A:middle
anywhere in your content

00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:28.646 A:middle
extension code.

00:21:28.846 --> 00:21:33.196 A:middle
You can now opt in to having

00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:34.456 A:middle
user interaction based on

00:21:34.456 --> 00:21:35.886 A:middle
touches within your content

00:21:35.886 --> 00:21:36.666 A:middle
extension views.

00:21:36.666 --> 00:21:40.436 A:middle
You can programmatically launch

00:21:40.436 --> 00:21:42.116 A:middle
the application from anywhere in

00:21:42.116 --> 00:21:44.926 A:middle
your content extension code as

00:21:44.926 --> 00:21:46.196 A:middle
well as dismiss the content

00:21:46.196 --> 00:21:48.086 A:middle
extension view, depending upon

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.936 A:middle
where you feel it serves best

00:21:50.056 --> 00:21:51.686 A:middle
your user's experience around

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:52.576 A:middle
the content extensions.

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:56.316 A:middle
So that's a varied list of APIs

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.876 A:middle
around content extensions, and

00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.436 A:middle
we hope this really helps you

00:21:59.436 --> 00:22:01.366 A:middle
enhance your user's experience
