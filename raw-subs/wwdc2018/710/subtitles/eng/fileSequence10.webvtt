00:09:58.506 --> 00:10:00.216 A:middle
For example, here, we have two

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:01.566 A:middle
actions here for like and

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.706 A:middle
comment, and we create a simple

00:10:03.706 --> 00:10:05.336 A:middle
UNNotificationAction for like

00:10:06.746 --> 00:10:08.376 A:middle
and a text input action for

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:08.966 A:middle
commenting.

00:10:11.596 --> 00:10:12.836 A:middle
And once we've created these

00:10:12.836 --> 00:10:14.236 A:middle
actions, we create a new

00:10:14.236 --> 00:10:16.186 A:middle
category giving it the same

00:10:16.186 --> 00:10:17.616 A:middle
identifier as the content

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:19.186 A:middle
extension where we want these

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:20.256 A:middle
actions to be presented.

00:10:20.256 --> 00:10:23.216 A:middle
And then, we pass it, the two

00:10:23.216 --> 00:10:27.656 A:middle
new actions that we created.

00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:29.476 A:middle
Once we've set up this category,

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:30.406 A:middle
then we call

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:32.576 A:middle
setNotificationCategories on the

00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:34.436 A:middle
UNNotificationCenter object

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:35.876 A:middle
associated with our class,

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:37.596 A:middle
giving it the new category that

00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:38.766 A:middle
we created.

00:10:40.856 --> 00:10:43.276 A:middle
So by simply doing so, the next

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.266 A:middle
time when the user goes to your

00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:46.226 A:middle
content extension we can see

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:47.486 A:middle
that these actions are now

00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:49.066 A:middle
available for them to interact

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:50.526 A:middle
with your notification content.

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:53.216 A:middle
Now let's take a look at how we

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:54.856 A:middle
can handle the responses from

00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:55.516 A:middle
these actions.

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:57.306 A:middle
There are two ways to do that.

00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:00.116 A:middle
Firstly, you can handle this
