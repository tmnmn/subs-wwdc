00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:02.256 A:middle
directly, the first of which

00:25:02.256 --> 00:25:04.046 A:middle
says deliver quietly, which is

00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:05.676 A:middle
probably a concept that's new to

00:25:05.676 --> 00:25:06.276 A:middle
all of you.

00:25:07.446 --> 00:25:08.746 A:middle
Some of these management views

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:10.546 A:middle
will also have an option that

00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:12.816 A:middle
says deliver prominently, so

00:25:12.816 --> 00:25:16.376 A:middle
let's talk about what this

00:25:16.596 --> 00:25:16.746 A:middle
means.

00:25:16.746 --> 00:25:18.486 A:middle
In iOS, we have a lot of

00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:19.846 A:middle
settings that users can

00:25:19.846 --> 00:25:21.686 A:middle
configure, and this is really

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:22.896 A:middle
great for the power user.

00:25:23.296 --> 00:25:24.756 A:middle
The can customize their settings

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:27.326 A:middle
to every detail, but for the

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.576 A:middle
regular user, we think that we

00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:31.046 A:middle
can help them out by

00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:32.706 A:middle
categorizing their notification

00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:34.516 A:middle
settings into two big

00:25:34.516 --> 00:25:35.076 A:middle
categories.

00:25:36.016 --> 00:25:37.436 A:middle
Notifications that are delivered

00:25:37.566 --> 00:25:39.486 A:middle
prominently and notifications

00:25:39.536 --> 00:25:40.796 A:middle
that are delivered quietly.

00:25:43.056 --> 00:25:44.926 A:middle
Notifications that are delivered

00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:46.356 A:middle
prominently are what we're used

00:25:46.436 --> 00:25:46.676 A:middle
to.

00:25:47.076 --> 00:25:48.016 A:middle
They show up on the locked

00:25:48.016 --> 00:25:48.426 A:middle
screen.

00:25:49.926 --> 00:25:50.996 A:middle
They show up in notification

00:25:50.996 --> 00:25:51.416 A:middle
center.

00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:53.486 A:middle
They roll down as banners.

00:25:54.226 --> 00:25:56.376 A:middle
They badge the AP icon and they

00:25:56.376 --> 00:25:59.296 A:middle
can play a sound.

00:25:59.466 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
Notifications that are delivered
