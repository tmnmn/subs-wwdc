00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:00.426 A:middle
these apps.

00:23:00.536 --> 00:23:02.516 A:middle
But often, they find themselves

00:23:02.686 --> 00:23:04.356 A:middle
in a situation like this.

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:07.446 A:middle
With far too many notifications.

00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:09.026 A:middle
And it becomes hard to sift

00:23:09.076 --> 00:23:10.846 A:middle
through and find the important

00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:11.096 A:middle
ones.

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:14.756 A:middle
So perhaps to make this easier,

00:23:14.756 --> 00:23:16.726 A:middle
this user has decided that

00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:18.386 A:middle
notifications from podcasts

00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:20.026 A:middle
don't need to be shown on the

00:23:20.026 --> 00:23:20.706 A:middle
locked screen.

00:23:21.476 --> 00:23:22.966 A:middle
Right now to configure that

00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:24.546 A:middle
they'd have to launch the

00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:25.896 A:middle
settings app, find

00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:28.506 A:middle
notifications, find the podcast

00:23:29.426 --> 00:23:30.776 A:middle
app, and then they can configure

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:31.316 A:middle
their settings.

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:33.976 A:middle
We wanted to make this easier.

00:23:34.616 --> 00:23:37.146 A:middle
So, in iOS 12, we're introducing

00:23:37.146 --> 00:23:39.936 A:middle
a new management view where the

00:23:39.936 --> 00:23:41.936 A:middle
users can configure their

00:23:41.936 --> 00:23:43.836 A:middle
notification settings directly

00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:45.886 A:middle
from the notification without

00:23:46.026 --> 00:23:46.836 A:middle
having to launch the settings

00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:46.976 A:middle
app.

00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:52.586 A:middle
There's three really easy ways

00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.696 A:middle
to get into this management

00:23:53.696 --> 00:23:53.936 A:middle
view.

00:23:54.436 --> 00:23:55.826 A:middle
The first is what we just saw.

00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:57.536 A:middle
You simply swipe over a

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.676 A:middle
notification, tap manage, and
