00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:02.016 A:middle
function, we update the UI as

00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:03.486 A:middle
well as update our application

00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:03.806 A:middle
state.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.886 A:middle
So here, it's important that

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:07.986 A:middle
since you're implementing your

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.915 A:middle
own user interactions that you

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:11.886 A:middle
are responsible for handling all

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:13.626 A:middle
these actions, responses, and

00:17:13.626 --> 00:17:14.846 A:middle
callbacks from the users

00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:15.316 A:middle
yourself.

00:17:17.976 --> 00:17:20.546 A:middle
So once we've set this up, now

00:17:20.546 --> 00:17:21.556 A:middle
when the user goes to your

00:17:21.556 --> 00:17:23.215 A:middle
content extension we see the

00:17:23.215 --> 00:17:24.556 A:middle
Like button, part of the UI

00:17:24.556 --> 00:17:26.705 A:middle
itself, and the user can simply

00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:28.175 A:middle
interact with that button right

00:17:28.175 --> 00:17:28.666 A:middle
there and then.

00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:35.536 A:middle
So that's the new functionality

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:36.536 A:middle
that we've added around content

00:17:36.536 --> 00:17:37.096 A:middle
extensions.

00:17:37.396 --> 00:17:38.746 A:middle
And coupled with notification

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:40.076 A:middle
actions, along with user

00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:41.686 A:middle
interaction touches, you now

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.846 A:middle
have a much richer set of tools

00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:44.966 A:middle
for creating much more

00:17:44.966 --> 00:17:46.646 A:middle
interactive and dynamic content

00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:48.336 A:middle
extension experiences for your

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:49.986 A:middle
applications notifications

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:50.416 A:middle
users.

00:17:52.516 --> 00:17:54.346 A:middle
Now let's talk about launching

00:17:54.346 --> 00:17:55.636 A:middle
your application from the

00:17:55.636 --> 00:17:56.906 A:middle
notification content extension.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.146 A:middle
So today the user can launch
