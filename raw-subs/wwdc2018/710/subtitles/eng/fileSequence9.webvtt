00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
get all the information around

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:02.586 A:middle
that notification to set up your

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:03.126 A:middle
custom view.

00:09:05.436 --> 00:09:07.776 A:middle
The info.plist file associated

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:08.856 A:middle
with your content extension

00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:10.076 A:middle
gives you more options.

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.876 A:middle
The important thing here is the

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:14.026 A:middle
category identifier.

00:09:14.466 --> 00:09:16.056 A:middle
Now, this identifier needs to

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.246 A:middle
match the same category

00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:18.846 A:middle
identifier you're setting on

00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.066 A:middle
your notification requests

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:21.546 A:middle
because that's how the system

00:09:21.546 --> 00:09:23.076 A:middle
knows which content extension to

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:24.566 A:middle
launch with which notification.

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:28.546 A:middle
Along with this, you can do some

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:30.516 A:middle
quick configurations of your

00:09:30.516 --> 00:09:31.756 A:middle
content extension such as

00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:33.436 A:middle
setting the initial content size

00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:34.936 A:middle
ratio, hiding the default

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:36.706 A:middle
content, as well as overriding

00:09:36.836 --> 00:09:38.136 A:middle
the title of this content

00:09:38.136 --> 00:09:38.576 A:middle
extension.

00:09:39.796 --> 00:09:41.896 A:middle
Now, the primary way in which

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:43.526 A:middle
your users interact with these

00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:45.136 A:middle
content extensions is through

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:47.086 A:middle
notification actions, and these

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.786 A:middle
actions are presented right

00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:50.366 A:middle
below the content of the content

00:09:50.366 --> 00:09:50.836 A:middle
extension.

00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:53.786 A:middle
Let's summarize how we can set

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:54.716 A:middle
up these actions as well.

00:09:56.126 --> 00:09:57.866 A:middle
So doing so is fairly trivial in

00:09:57.866 --> 00:09:57.976 A:middle
code.

00:09:58.506 --> 00:10:00.216 A:middle
For example, here, we have two
