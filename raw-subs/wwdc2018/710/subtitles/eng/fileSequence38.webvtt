want to receive.

00:38:03.096 --> 00:38:04.496 A:middle
We also talked about provisional

00:38:04.496 --> 00:38:06.086 A:middle
authorizations, which is an

00:38:06.146 --> 00:38:07.306 A:middle
automatic trial of the

00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:08.876 A:middle
notifications from your app,

00:38:09.626 --> 00:38:10.806 A:middle
which will help you users make a

00:38:10.806 --> 00:38:13.196 A:middle
more informed decision about

00:38:13.196 --> 00:38:14.146 A:middle
whether they want these

00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:15.386 A:middle
notifications or not.

00:38:15.956 --> 00:38:18.416 A:middle
And last, we talked about

00:38:18.456 --> 00:38:20.546 A:middle
critical alerts, which are a new

00:38:20.546 --> 00:38:22.606 A:middle
type of notification that

00:38:22.976 --> 00:38:24.566 A:middle
requires the user to take action

00:38:24.566 --> 00:38:25.976 A:middle
immediately and that are

00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:26.686 A:middle
disruptive.

00:38:27.446 --> 00:38:29.236 A:middle
So we hope you take advantage of

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:31.506 A:middle
all of these great APIs and make

00:38:31.506 --> 00:38:33.236 A:middle
the notification experience for

00:38:33.236 --> 00:38:34.556 A:middle
your users even better.

00:38:35.556 --> 00:38:36.886 A:middle
You can find all the information

00:38:36.886 --> 00:38:37.976 A:middle
about this session on our

00:38:37.976 --> 00:38:39.206 A:middle
sessions' page at

00:38:39.206 --> 00:38:40.776 A:middle

00:38:41.136 --> 00:38:42.726 A:middle
We're session 710.

00:38:43.406 --> 00:38:45.096 A:middle
We have another session just

00:38:45.096 --> 00:38:46.636 A:middle
following this one in hall three

00:38:46.966 --> 00:38:48.136 A:middle
called using grouped

00:38:48.196 --> 00:38:50.096 A:middle
notification where we'll help

00:38:50.096 --> 00:38:52.136 A:middle
you determine how to best group

00:38:52.136 --> 00:38:54.346 A:middle
notifications for your app.

00:38:54.736 --> 00:38:56.336 A:middle
We have two notifications labs,

00:38:56.686 --> 00:38:58.176 A:middle
one today and one tomorrow,

00:38:58.426 --> 00:38:59.636 A:middle
where you can come and ask the

00:38:59.636 --> 00:39:01.396 A:middle
