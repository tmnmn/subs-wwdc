00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:00.706 A:middle
And I'm happy to announce that

00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:01.846 A:middle
we're taking away this

00:16:01.846 --> 00:16:03.126 A:middle
restriction with iOS 12.

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:07.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:08.046 --> 00:16:09.636 A:middle
So now your content extensions

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.826 A:middle
have the option of opting in to

00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:13.456 A:middle
receiving user interaction

00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:16.286 A:middle
[inaudible] touches, and setting

00:16:16.286 --> 00:16:17.786 A:middle
this up, it's fairly trivial.

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:20.096 A:middle
All you have to do is add a new

00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:22.446 A:middle
key value option to your

00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:23.326 A:middle
info.plist file.

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:26.556 A:middle
And the key that we've added is

00:16:26.556 --> 00:16:29.446 A:middle
the UNNotificationExtensionUser

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:30.386 A:middle
InteractionEnabled.

00:16:32.586 --> 00:16:34.436 A:middle
So going back to our sample,

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:36.576 A:middle
what if we want to remove the

00:16:36.576 --> 00:16:38.416 A:middle
like action from a notification

00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:40.556 A:middle
action and make it a UI

00:16:40.556 --> 00:16:42.626 A:middle
interaction touch that's part of

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:43.326 A:middle
the view itself?

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:45.506 A:middle
So once we've configured our

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:48.376 A:middle
info.plist file, we can go back

00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:49.776 A:middle
to our content extension view

00:16:50.126 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
and create our own custom button

00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:53.366 A:middle
to handle the like gesture.

00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:56.396 A:middle
We add a target for our own

00:16:56.396 --> 00:16:59.806 A:middle
private method and inside that

00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:02.016 A:middle
function, we update the UI as
