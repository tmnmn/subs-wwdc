00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.276 A:middle
using the thread identifier and

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:02.406 A:middle
for a local notification.

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:03.636 A:middle
You can set it on the

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:05.606 A:middle
UNMutableNotificationContent

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:06.906 A:middle
object as seen here.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:10.096 A:middle
And for a remote notification

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:11.876 A:middle
payload, you can also include it

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:13.366 A:middle
as part of your notification

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:13.706 A:middle
payload.

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.816 A:middle
Now the thread identifier might

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:19.286 A:middle
be familiar to some of you

00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:19.696 A:middle
already.

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:23.616 A:middle
We use it today for forwarding

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:25.486 A:middle
notifications to a notification

00:03:25.486 --> 00:03:27.126 A:middle
content extension that is

00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:28.976 A:middle
presented for your application,

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.406 A:middle
which has the exact same thread

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:32.336 A:middle
identifier, allowing the content

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:33.986 A:middle
extension view to update it

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:35.176 A:middle
based on the new incoming

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:35.846 A:middle
notification.

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:39.346 A:middle
Starting in iOS 11, we started

00:03:39.346 --> 00:03:41.536 A:middle
using the thread identifier for

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:43.386 A:middle
doing grouping of notifications,

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:44.806 A:middle
if the user had turned on

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:45.826 A:middle
[inaudible] notification

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:46.326 A:middle
previous.

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:48.126 A:middle
So we're just taking this

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:50.006 A:middle
concept and expanding it for all

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:51.096 A:middle
notifications in general.

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:54.726 A:middle
So how does this grouping work?

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:57.166 A:middle
So when a new notification comes

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:59.676 A:middle
in to you, the user's device, if

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:01.556 A:middle
there is no thread identifier
