00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:00.276 A:middle
However, you can also create a

00:07:00.276 --> 00:07:02.046 A:middle
custom summary text so you can

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.756 A:middle
give your users much better

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.556 A:middle
context of what kind of

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:07.016 A:middle
information is included in that

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:07.906 A:middle
group.

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:11.066 A:middle
Now, we will cover this API and

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:14.276 A:middle
go over much larger use cases of

00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:15.586 A:middle
how you can create your custom

00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:17.406 A:middle
groups in the advanced session

00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:18.236 A:middle
around using group

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:19.686 A:middle
notifications, which will follow

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:20.136 A:middle
this session.

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:23.846 A:middle
So let's do a quick summary of

00:07:23.846 --> 00:07:25.156 A:middle
group notifications as we saw

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:26.026 A:middle
them today.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.126 A:middle
Starting in iOS 12, all

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.966 A:middle
application notifications are

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:30.666 A:middle
going to be grouped

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:31.376 A:middle
automatically.

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:34.646 A:middle
You can start using the thread

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:36.486 A:middle
identifier if you want to create

00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:38.056 A:middle
your own custom groups for your

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:40.896 A:middle
applications, but the user does

00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:42.736 A:middle
have the option of changing this

00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:43.806 A:middle
grouping setting for your

00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:45.166 A:middle
applications' notifications.

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:48.486 A:middle
And lastly, you can use the

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:50.716 A:middle
summary text for customizing the

00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:51.996 A:middle
information you want to provide

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:53.986 A:middle
the user around the notification

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:55.006 A:middle
groups that you're creating.

00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:58.706 A:middle
All right, so that was group

00:07:58.706 --> 00:07:59.426 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.416 A:middle
Now, let's move on to the next
