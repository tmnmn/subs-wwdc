00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:01.356 A:middle
to use .provisional as a

00:33:01.406 --> 00:33:03.506 A:middle
qualifier option in addition to

00:33:03.766 --> 00:33:05.206 A:middle
whatever other options you're

00:33:05.206 --> 00:33:05.846 A:middle
requesting.

00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:07.836 A:middle
That's what we have for

00:33:07.836 --> 00:33:09.426 A:middle
provisional authorization.

00:33:10.016 --> 00:33:14.816 A:middle
And the last big feature that I

00:33:14.816 --> 00:33:16.396 A:middle
want to talk to you about are

00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:17.456 A:middle
critical alerts.

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:22.466 A:middle
Often when I'm in the middle of

00:33:22.466 --> 00:33:23.906 A:middle
a meeting or attending something

00:33:23.906 --> 00:33:25.906 A:middle
important, my phone looks like

00:33:25.966 --> 00:33:26.086 A:middle
this.

00:33:26.506 --> 00:33:27.936 A:middle
And as you can see, I have do

00:33:27.936 --> 00:33:29.026 A:middle
not disturb turned on.

00:33:29.736 --> 00:33:31.156 A:middle
Or at least I have the ringer

00:33:31.156 --> 00:33:32.606 A:middle
switch turned off so that I

00:33:32.606 --> 00:33:34.476 A:middle
don't hear any sounds when I get

00:33:34.836 --> 00:33:35.616 A:middle
notifications.

00:33:36.506 --> 00:33:38.326 A:middle
And usually this is really good,

00:33:39.346 --> 00:33:42.836 A:middle
but I would have missed a really

00:33:42.836 --> 00:33:44.626 A:middle
important notification like this

00:33:44.626 --> 00:33:44.856 A:middle
one.

00:33:45.606 --> 00:33:46.666 A:middle
This is a health-related

00:33:46.666 --> 00:33:47.526 A:middle
notification.

00:33:48.016 --> 00:33:49.326 A:middle
That's from a glucose monitor

00:33:49.606 --> 00:33:51.336 A:middle
that's warning me of low blood

00:33:51.336 --> 00:33:53.456 A:middle
sugar, and this is something I

00:33:53.456 --> 00:33:54.746 A:middle
would want to see immediately.

00:33:55.996 --> 00:33:58.156 A:middle
Scenarios like this made us

00:33:58.156 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
realize that we need a new type
