00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:00.606 A:middle
Now what are the different

00:06:00.606 --> 00:06:01.956 A:middle
components of a notification

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:02.186 A:middle
group?

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:05.076 A:middle
The content that we show is for

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.696 A:middle
the latest notification that was

00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:08.106 A:middle
received as part of that group.

00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:11.996 A:middle
And then the user can simply see

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.936 A:middle
all the notifications by tapping

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:16.166 A:middle
on this group, and we expand all

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:17.196 A:middle
the notifications' content.

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:19.086 A:middle
And then the user can interact

00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:20.356 A:middle
with all these notifications

00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:21.216 A:middle
individually as well.

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:23.876 A:middle
The two buttons at the top give

00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:25.246 A:middle
the users much greater control

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:26.956 A:middle
like collapsing the stack as

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:28.146 A:middle
well as clearing all these

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:29.466 A:middle
notifications together.

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:34.206 A:middle
Now, notification grouping also

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:35.806 A:middle
makes triaging of notifications

00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:36.646 A:middle
much better.

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:38.446 A:middle
For example, in this case, the

00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:39.896 A:middle
user can clear all these

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:41.526 A:middle
notifications together by simply

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.116 A:middle
swiping to the right and tapping

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:43.526 A:middle
clear all.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.916 A:middle
Apart from the content of the

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:49.936 A:middle
notification group, we also show

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:50.986 A:middle
a summary text.

00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:52.906 A:middle
Now, this summary text, by

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:54.886 A:middle
default, shows the count of all

00:06:54.886 --> 00:06:56.486 A:middle
the notifications that are part

00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:57.126 A:middle
of that group.

00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:00.276 A:middle
However, you can also create a
