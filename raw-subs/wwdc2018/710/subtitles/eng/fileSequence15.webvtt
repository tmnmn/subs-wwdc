00:14:58.956 --> 00:15:00.026 A:middle
replacing the currently

00:15:00.026 --> 00:15:00.846 A:middle
presented actions.

00:15:01.236 --> 00:15:03.306 A:middle
For example, if the leading

00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:05.326 A:middle
action was rate, then you can

00:15:05.326 --> 00:15:07.046 A:middle
provide a secondary list of the

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:08.406 A:middle
different types of ratings that

00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:10.366 A:middle
you want your user to take.

00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:14.556 A:middle
And you can also remove all

00:15:14.556 --> 00:15:16.176 A:middle
these notification actions if

00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:17.746 A:middle
you feel it does not make sense

00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:19.316 A:middle
anymore for your content

00:15:19.316 --> 00:15:20.286 A:middle
extension to present these

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:20.716 A:middle
actions.

00:15:21.106 --> 00:15:25.426 A:middle
So that's the new API around

00:15:25.456 --> 00:15:26.476 A:middle
notification actions.

00:15:26.796 --> 00:15:28.456 A:middle
And we feel this will really

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:30.706 A:middle
help you enhance the experience

00:15:30.706 --> 00:15:32.316 A:middle
that your users have around your

00:15:32.316 --> 00:15:33.986 A:middle
content extensions with the

00:15:33.986 --> 00:15:35.196 A:middle
different actions now you can

00:15:35.196 --> 00:15:39.036 A:middle
present to them.

00:15:39.216 --> 00:15:40.576 A:middle
Let's move on and talk about

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:41.806 A:middle
user interaction with these

00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:42.676 A:middle
content extensions.

00:15:43.836 --> 00:15:45.796 A:middle
Now notification actions were

00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:47.726 A:middle
important up till this point

00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:51.146 A:middle
because till iOS 11 we did not

00:15:51.146 --> 00:15:53.166 A:middle
allow user interaction touches

00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:54.456 A:middle
with your content extension

00:15:56.086 --> 00:15:56.196 A:middle
view.

00:15:56.416 --> 00:15:57.486 A:middle
Now we received a lot of

00:15:57.486 --> 00:15:58.536 A:middle
feedback around this.

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:00.706 A:middle
And I'm happy to announce that
