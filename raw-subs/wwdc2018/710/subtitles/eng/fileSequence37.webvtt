00:37:01.106 --> 00:37:01.966 A:middle
So that's what we have for

00:37:01.966 --> 00:37:02.746 A:middle
critical alerts.

00:37:03.356 --> 00:37:04.586 A:middle
They're a new type of

00:37:05.326 --> 00:37:07.266 A:middle
notification that requires the

00:37:07.306 --> 00:37:08.886 A:middle
users to take action

00:37:08.966 --> 00:37:09.796 A:middle
immediately.

00:37:10.376 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
And they're very disruptive, so

00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:14.206 A:middle
you need entitlement to be able

00:37:14.206 --> 00:37:14.656 A:middle
to send them.

00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:20.226 A:middle
So that's all the new exciting

00:37:20.226 --> 00:37:22.396 A:middle
APIs that we have for you today.

00:37:23.036 --> 00:37:24.486 A:middle
I just want to quickly go over

00:37:24.816 --> 00:37:25.996 A:middle
all the things that we covered.

00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:30.656 A:middle
We talked about how you can use

00:37:30.756 --> 00:37:32.356 A:middle
thread identifiers to group your

00:37:32.356 --> 00:37:35.136 A:middle
notifications to help your users

00:37:35.136 --> 00:37:36.576 A:middle
organize their notification

00:37:36.576 --> 00:37:38.706 A:middle
lists better.

00:37:38.896 --> 00:37:40.206 A:middle
We talked about all the great

00:37:40.206 --> 00:37:42.116 A:middle
new APIs around notification

00:37:42.116 --> 00:37:44.046 A:middle
content extensions, which will

00:37:44.046 --> 00:37:45.366 A:middle
help you make your rich

00:37:45.366 --> 00:37:46.956 A:middle
notifications much more

00:37:46.996 --> 00:37:47.676 A:middle
interactive.

00:37:48.256 --> 00:37:51.176 A:middle
We talked about how you can

00:37:51.176 --> 00:37:52.796 A:middle
provide a custom settings view

00:37:52.796 --> 00:37:54.746 A:middle
within your app to allow your

00:37:54.746 --> 00:37:57.256 A:middle
users more granular control over

00:37:57.256 --> 00:37:59.626 A:middle
what kind of notifications they

00:37:59.626 --> 00:38:02.926 A:middle
want to receive.
