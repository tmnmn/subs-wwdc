00:12:58.526 --> 00:13:00.396 A:middle
issues and we have introduced a

00:13:00.396 --> 00:13:02.326 A:middle
new API around notification

00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:04.206 A:middle
actions, where now we're

00:13:04.206 --> 00:13:05.496 A:middle
exposing these notification

00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:06.666 A:middle
actions as part of the

00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:08.736 A:middle
NSExtensionContext tied to your

00:13:08.736 --> 00:13:09.596 A:middle
content extension.

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:12.356 A:middle
What this API allows you to do

00:13:12.576 --> 00:13:14.146 A:middle
is access the currently

00:13:14.146 --> 00:13:15.626 A:middle
presented notification actions

00:13:15.626 --> 00:13:17.626 A:middle
to the user as well as replace

00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:19.526 A:middle
these actions by setting a brand

00:13:19.526 --> 00:13:20.766 A:middle
new array of notification

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.786 A:middle
actions for your content

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:25.556 A:middle
extension.

00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:27.016 A:middle
So going back to our sample,

00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:28.826 A:middle
what if after the user took the

00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:30.476 A:middle
like action we wanted to replace

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.546 A:middle
it say with the unlike action so

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.896 A:middle
that they can do the reverse of

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.776 A:middle
the action they just took?

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:39.226 A:middle
So using this new API, let's

00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:40.356 A:middle
take a look of how we can set

00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:41.286 A:middle
this up.

00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:42.816 A:middle
So we go back to our did receive

00:13:42.816 --> 00:13:44.206 A:middle
response method and again

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:46.296 A:middle
identify the like action and

00:13:46.296 --> 00:13:47.716 A:middle
update our application state.

00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:51.216 A:middle
This time, we also create a new

00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:53.446 A:middle
action for unlike, giving it a

00:13:53.446 --> 00:13:55.146 A:middle
unique identifier as well as a

00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:55.476 A:middle
title.

00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:59.816 A:middle
We can also take a look at the

00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:01.436 A:middle
currently presented actions so
