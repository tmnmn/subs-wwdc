00:25:59.466 --> 00:26:00.806 A:middle
Notifications that are delivered

00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:02.966 A:middle
quietly only show up in

00:26:02.966 --> 00:26:04.556 A:middle
notification center and they

00:26:04.556 --> 00:26:08.156 A:middle
don't play a sound.

00:26:08.346 --> 00:26:09.876 A:middle
And from the management view, in

00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:12.066 A:middle
addition to configuring whether

00:26:12.066 --> 00:26:13.506 A:middle
they want their notifications

00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:15.176 A:middle
delivered prominently or

00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:17.666 A:middle
quietly, users also have the

00:26:17.696 --> 00:26:19.366 A:middle
option to turn off their

00:26:19.366 --> 00:26:20.226 A:middle
notifications.

00:26:21.636 --> 00:26:23.806 A:middle
Now, I know that you might worry

00:26:23.806 --> 00:26:25.146 A:middle
that your users are going to

00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:26.406 A:middle
turn off the notifications for

00:26:26.406 --> 00:26:29.166 A:middle
your app, so we've added this

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:31.526 A:middle
extra confirmation sheet just in

00:26:31.526 --> 00:26:33.126 A:middle
case they do tap turn off.

00:26:33.806 --> 00:26:35.476 A:middle
And from here, they can also

00:26:35.766 --> 00:26:36.996 A:middle
turn off their notifications.

00:26:37.426 --> 00:26:39.636 A:middle
But we've also added an API to

00:26:39.636 --> 00:26:41.536 A:middle
add a second option to this

00:26:41.906 --> 00:26:44.386 A:middle
confirmation sheet, and podcast

00:26:44.386 --> 00:26:46.166 A:middle
has taken advantage of this API,

00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:48.476 A:middle
so it says configure in podcast.

00:26:49.556 --> 00:26:52.176 A:middle
This is a link that will deep

00:26:52.176 --> 00:26:54.286 A:middle
link within the podcast app to a

00:26:54.326 --> 00:26:56.776 A:middle
custom settings view that allows

00:26:56.776 --> 00:26:59.256 A:middle
the user more granular control

00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
about what kind of podcast
