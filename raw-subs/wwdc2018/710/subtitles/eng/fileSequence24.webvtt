00:24:00.416 --> 00:24:02.126 A:middle
the management view comes up.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:07.196 A:middle
The second is if you can go into

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.956 A:middle
the rich notification, you can

00:24:08.956 --> 00:24:10.706 A:middle
tap in the right corner, and you

00:24:10.706 --> 00:24:11.866 A:middle
can also launch the management

00:24:11.866 --> 00:24:12.066 A:middle
view.

00:24:12.596 --> 00:24:15.676 A:middle
And the third is actually in the

00:24:15.676 --> 00:24:16.386 A:middle
list itself.

00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:18.616 A:middle
Depending on how your users are

00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:19.476 A:middle
interacting with their

00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:21.006 A:middle
notifications, they will

00:24:21.006 --> 00:24:22.566 A:middle
occasionally see suggestions,

00:24:22.616 --> 00:24:24.446 A:middle
like this one, that ask them if

00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:25.676 A:middle
they want to keep receiving

00:24:25.926 --> 00:24:27.226 A:middle
podcast notifications.

00:24:27.886 --> 00:24:29.496 A:middle
And from here, as well, they can

00:24:29.496 --> 00:24:31.346 A:middle
tap manage and bring up the

00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:32.086 A:middle
management view.

00:24:32.686 --> 00:24:35.456 A:middle
Let's take a closer look at the

00:24:35.456 --> 00:24:36.196 A:middle
management view.

00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:38.626 A:middle
And we obviously have options

00:24:38.626 --> 00:24:40.436 A:middle
here where users can configure

00:24:40.436 --> 00:24:41.606 A:middle
their notification settings

00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:43.216 A:middle
directly from this view.

00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:45.906 A:middle
But if they want to go into the

00:24:45.906 --> 00:24:47.976 A:middle
settings app and configure in a

00:24:47.976 --> 00:24:50.146 A:middle
more detailed manner, they have

00:24:50.146 --> 00:24:52.146 A:middle
a quick link to the settings for

00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:53.356 A:middle
this application, the

00:24:53.356 --> 00:24:55.446 A:middle
notification settings.

00:24:56.106 --> 00:24:58.676 A:middle
A And also from this view, they

00:24:58.676 --> 00:24:59.896 A:middle
have some actions they can take

00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:02.256 A:middle
directly, the first of which
