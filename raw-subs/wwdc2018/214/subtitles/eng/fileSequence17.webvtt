00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:00.986 A:middle
Then, I'm going to check if it's

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:01.466 A:middle
available.

00:17:06.656 --> 00:17:09.086 A:middle
If it isn't, I'm going to call

00:17:09.086 --> 00:17:10.646 A:middle
the Completion Handler with our

00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:12.076 A:middle
new Failure, Out of Stock Error.

00:17:18.096 --> 00:17:20.175 A:middle
And provided the soup object

00:17:20.175 --> 00:17:21.126 A:middle
that the user requested.

00:17:25.215 --> 00:17:27.526 A:middle
Alright, so we have provided the

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:29.006 A:middle
custom error code here in

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:29.546 A:middle
completion.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:31.206 A:middle
Let's take a look at Handle.

00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:34.926 A:middle
Handling this intent means

00:17:34.926 --> 00:17:35.736 A:middle
ordering our soup.

00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:38.146 A:middle
So first, we build the Order

00:17:38.146 --> 00:17:39.586 A:middle
Object from Intent.

00:17:41.006 --> 00:17:42.976 A:middle
Then we place the order, using

00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:43.736 A:middle
our order manager.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.166 A:middle
And finally, let the system know

00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:48.626 A:middle
that the order was successful.

00:17:49.556 --> 00:17:50.976 A:middle
But this is our chance to

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:52.766 A:middle
provide users with more helpful

00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:54.206 A:middle
information like wait time.

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:55.776 A:middle
So, let's call the Completion

00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.316 A:middle
Handler with our New Custom

00:17:57.316 --> 00:17:58.466 A:middle
Response Code.
