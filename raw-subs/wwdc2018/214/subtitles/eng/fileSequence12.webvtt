00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:00.086 A:middle
Either, they can go into our app

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
and order something else or try

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:02.516 A:middle
again later.

00:12:05.896 --> 00:12:08.336 A:middle
So, you saw that Siri and

00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:09.816 A:middle
shortcuts allowed you to provide

00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:13.186 A:middle
custom dialogues, but that's not

00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:13.606 A:middle
all.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:16.436 A:middle
As soup engineers, we work

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:19.656 A:middle
really hard to build superb

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:21.446 A:middle
experiences for our users.

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:27.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:30.886 A:middle
And wouldn't it be great if we

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:32.756 A:middle
can bring those experiences from

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:34.616 A:middle
our apps to our shortcuts

00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:36.286 A:middle
wherever they are run?

00:12:36.536 --> 00:12:38.856 A:middle
With Intents UI extensions, you

00:12:38.856 --> 00:12:41.536 A:middle
can do just that.

00:12:41.536 --> 00:12:43.716 A:middle
Intents UI extensions allow you

00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:46.166 A:middle
to provide custom UI, familiar

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.676 A:middle
UI from your apps, to shortcuts.

00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:50.296 A:middle
And it is displayed all across

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.316 A:middle
the OS, on Lock Screen, in

00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:54.286 A:middle
Search , and of course, within

00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:54.646 A:middle
Siri.

00:12:55.996 --> 00:12:57.986 A:middle
To learn more about how you can

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.926 A:middle
