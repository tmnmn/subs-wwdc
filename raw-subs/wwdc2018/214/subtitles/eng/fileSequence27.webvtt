00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:01.496 A:middle
So, in the first two cases,

00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:03.516 A:middle
where the shortcut type contains

00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:05.106 A:middle
both a soup and a delivery

00:27:05.106 --> 00:27:07.176 A:middle
location, I see an image of a

00:27:07.216 --> 00:27:08.536 A:middle
soup, but in the last case,

00:27:08.656 --> 00:27:10.286 A:middle
where the shortcut type just

00:27:10.286 --> 00:27:12.136 A:middle
contains a delivery location, I

00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:13.966 A:middle
just see the image of a delivery

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:14.526 A:middle
location.

00:27:15.716 --> 00:27:16.906 A:middle
Now, these shortcuts are looking

00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:18.096 A:middle
so great, that I just want to

00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:19.766 A:middle
tap on one and add it to Siri,

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:20.386 A:middle
so I can use it.

00:27:21.456 --> 00:27:23.306 A:middle
And our users are super excited

00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:24.566 A:middle
about this new feature too, and

00:27:24.566 --> 00:27:26.556 A:middle
they're all so eager to start

00:27:26.556 --> 00:27:27.856 A:middle
setting up new shortcuts to use

00:27:27.856 --> 00:27:28.706 A:middle
with Siri.

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.366 A:middle
But as more users starting using

00:27:30.366 --> 00:27:31.666 A:middle
this feature, we noticed

00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:31.966 A:middle
something.

00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:32.846 A:middle
We noticed a problem.

00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:35.606 A:middle
When they got to the recording

00:27:35.676 --> 00:27:36.796 A:middle
screen, they had no idea what to

00:27:36.796 --> 00:27:37.096 A:middle
say.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:39.206 A:middle
They could use some creative

00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:41.356 A:middle
inspiration in choosing a great

00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:42.606 A:middle
suggested shortcut phrase.

00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:45.496 A:middle
And as Soup Chef app developers

00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.336 A:middle
and general soup enthusiasts, we

00:27:47.336 --> 00:27:48.576 A:middle
think we have some pretty great

00:27:48.576 --> 00:27:50.406 A:middle
ideas on what would make a great

00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.226 A:middle
soup ordering phrase.

00:27:51.226 --> 00:27:52.206 A:middle
You know, something like

00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:54.226 A:middle
"Tomato, Tomato" or "Chowder

00:27:54.226 --> 00:27:54.696 A:middle
Time."

00:27:55.686 --> 00:27:57.846 A:middle
So, would it be great if we can

00:27:57.846 --> 00:27:59.476 A:middle
show a suggestion like this?
