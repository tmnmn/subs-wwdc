00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:05.786 A:middle
This response template takes the

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:07.536 A:middle
soup and wait time strengths.

00:18:08.496 --> 00:18:10.946 A:middle
So, I'll provide that from my

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:11.356 A:middle
intent.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.776 A:middle
And we can grab the wait time

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:21.546 A:middle
from our order.

00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.346 A:middle
And that's it.

00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:29.886 A:middle
So, you saw how easy it is to

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.996 A:middle
add support for custom responses

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.186 A:middle
to our custom intent.

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:37.976 A:middle
You start by defining a custom

00:18:37.976 --> 00:18:39.986 A:middle
intent that works for your use

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:40.336 A:middle
case.

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.846 A:middle
You follow it up by defining

00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:45.386 A:middle
custom responses that you want

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:46.166 A:middle
Siri to speak out.

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:48.516 A:middle
And finally, you provide them in

00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:49.286 A:middle
your Intent Handler.

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.416 A:middle
Now, I placed that order for

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:54.096 A:middle
that soup earlier, so I better

00:18:54.096 --> 00:18:55.146 A:middle
head back and get it.

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:59.016 A:middle
So, please welcome Ayaka Nonaka,

00:18:59.016 --> 00:19:01.086 A:middle
who will talk to you about some
