00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:00.476 A:middle
learned about, I think we can

00:23:00.476 --> 00:23:02.076 A:middle
all agree that this is not a

00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:02.806 A:middle
good example.

00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:04.346 A:middle
So, let's try to make it better.

00:23:05.146 --> 00:23:06.706 A:middle
So, the first easy thing that we

00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:08.526 A:middle
can do is to drop the "From Soup

00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:10.146 A:middle
Chef," because as you see, Soup

00:23:10.146 --> 00:23:11.566 A:middle
Chef is already attributed in

00:23:11.566 --> 00:23:11.876 A:middle
this UI.

00:23:12.686 --> 00:23:15.676 A:middle
So, now we have "A Clam

00:23:15.676 --> 00:23:16.016 A:middle
Chowder."

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:18.176 A:middle
But when I'm looking at this,

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:19.526 A:middle
I'm not sure what's going to

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:20.836 A:middle
happen when I run the shortcut.

00:23:20.836 --> 00:23:23.346 A:middle
Am I ordering the soup or just

00:23:23.346 --> 00:23:23.996 A:middle
looking at it?

00:23:24.286 --> 00:23:24.676 A:middle
Who knows?

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:26.466 A:middle
So, let's fix that by adding a

00:23:26.466 --> 00:23:26.816 A:middle
verb.

00:23:27.466 --> 00:23:28.376 A:middle
And while I'm doing that, I'm

00:23:28.376 --> 00:23:30.076 A:middle
also going to drop the article

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:34.526 A:middle
"a" to save some space.

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:36.066 A:middle
So now I have "Order Clam

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:36.496 A:middle
Chowder."

00:23:37.746 --> 00:23:38.916 A:middle
So, when I'm looking at this,

00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:40.586 A:middle
I'm thinking, "I want to order a

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:42.176 A:middle
Clam Chowder, not a Clam

00:23:42.256 --> 00:23:43.666 A:middle
Chowder, which doesn't sound

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:44.926 A:middle
very delicious and we're trying

00:23:44.926 --> 00:23:46.806 A:middle
to sell soup here, so that's

00:23:46.806 --> 00:23:47.996 A:middle
really not ideal.

00:23:48.746 --> 00:23:51.316 A:middle
But the good thing is, we can

00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:52.886 A:middle
fix this really easily by simply

00:23:52.886 --> 00:23:54.206 A:middle
dropping the quotation marks.

00:23:55.466 --> 00:23:56.586 A:middle
And now we have, "Order Clam

00:23:56.586 --> 00:23:56.976 A:middle
Chowder."

00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:58.316 A:middle
And I think at this point, our

00:23:58.466 --> 00:23:59.606 A:middle
title's looking pretty good.
