00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:02.476 A:middle
This gives you the opportunity

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:04.166 A:middle
to provide critical information

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:06.626 A:middle
before your users commit to

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:07.546 A:middle
running the shortcut.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:12.166 A:middle
Next, is a success response.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
And it gives you a chance to

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:16.146 A:middle
provide an auxiliary relevant

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:17.826 A:middle
information, after the shortcut

00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:19.806 A:middle
has run, and the structure of a

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:22.146 A:middle
success response consists of

00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:24.596 A:middle
Siri letting the users know that

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.646 A:middle
their order was successful, or

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.046 A:middle
their shortcut ran successfully,

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:30.176 A:middle
followed by any information that

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:32.066 A:middle
you provide attributed to your

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:32.806 A:middle
app.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.316 A:middle
The third type of custom

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:38.156 A:middle
response is an informational

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:38.686 A:middle
response.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.466 A:middle
And we are really excited about

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:42.276 A:middle
this.

00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:44.516 A:middle
Informational response allows

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.086 A:middle
you to provide information like

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:48.986 A:middle
transit schedules or ski

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:52.606 A:middle
forecast right within Siri, with

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:53.436 A:middle
voice.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.076 A:middle
This opens the door for a whole

00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:57.106 A:middle
new category of apps which was

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.296 A:middle
not possible before with Siri.
