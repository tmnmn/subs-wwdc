00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.286 A:middle
their shortcut phrase as "Hey,

00:29:00.286 --> 00:29:01.586 A:middle
Siri, Chowder Time," when they

00:29:01.586 --> 00:29:02.806 A:middle
actually run the shortcut, they

00:29:02.806 --> 00:29:04.166 A:middle
might have to say, "Hey Siri,

00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:06.026 A:middle
Hey Siri, Chowder Time," and no

00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:09.856 A:middle
one wants to do that.

00:29:09.976 --> 00:29:11.206 A:middle
So, let's take a look at some

00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:11.726 A:middle
examples.

00:29:12.286 --> 00:29:15.996 A:middle
This example says, "Hey, Siri,

00:29:15.996 --> 00:29:17.476 A:middle
please place an order, thank

00:29:17.476 --> 00:29:17.646 A:middle
you."

00:29:18.226 --> 00:29:20.936 A:middle
Although this example is polite,

00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:22.976 A:middle
it's not a good example.

00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:25.256 A:middle
First, it contains, "Hey, Siri,"

00:29:25.256 --> 00:29:27.126 A:middle
which is pretty obvious, but

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:28.356 A:middle
it's a little bit too long for

00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:29.656 A:middle
me to want to repeat it every,

00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:30.796 A:middle
single time I want to run the

00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:31.656 A:middle
shortcut.

00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:32.226 A:middle
So, that's out.

00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:34.316 A:middle
What about this example?

00:29:35.016 --> 00:29:36.766 A:middle
This example says, "Order a clam

00:29:36.766 --> 00:29:38.146 A:middle
chowder to my office."

00:29:38.726 --> 00:29:40.726 A:middle
Seems pretty reasonable, but

00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:42.296 A:middle
this is still not good because

00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:43.836 A:middle
it's still too long.

00:29:43.836 --> 00:29:44.916 A:middle
Like, it's not short and

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:45.456 A:middle
memorable.

00:29:45.546 --> 00:29:47.176 A:middle
And I don't think I can or want

00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:48.486 A:middle
to remember to say this phrase

00:29:48.696 --> 00:29:50.276 A:middle
every, single time I want clam

00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:51.666 A:middle
chowder delivered to my office.

00:29:53.216 --> 00:29:54.386 A:middle
What about this example?

00:29:55.076 --> 00:29:56.486 A:middle
This simply says, "Chowder

00:29:56.486 --> 00:29:56.776 A:middle
Time."

00:29:57.206 --> 00:29:59.366 A:middle
This is both short and memorable

00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.856 A:middle
and doesn't include the phrase,
