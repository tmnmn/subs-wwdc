00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.666 A:middle
intent called Order Soup, and it

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.596 A:middle
lets you, you guessed it, order

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:02.926 A:middle
soup.

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:08.316 A:middle
Alongside the intent, you have

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:09.756 A:middle
to pick a category for your

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:09.986 A:middle
intent.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:12.266 A:middle
And the category you pick

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:14.746 A:middle
influences how Siri speaks about

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:17.286 A:middle
it or what you see across the OS

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:18.246 A:middle
like the order buttons.

00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:20.636 A:middle
So, pick something that feels

00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:22.536 A:middle
natural, that works well with

00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:24.846 A:middle
your use case.

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:26.936 A:middle
Once we have defined our custom

00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:29.166 A:middle
intent, let's go over to the

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:31.056 A:middle
Responses Tab.

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:32.706 A:middle
And in the Responses Tab, you

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:34.166 A:middle
see that we already have a

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.226 A:middle
success and failure response

00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:36.626 A:middle
codes.

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:38.676 A:middle
But these are just a generic

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:39.806 A:middle
response codes which don't

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:41.096 A:middle
convey much more information

00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:42.506 A:middle
besides the status of the

00:07:42.506 --> 00:07:42.996 A:middle
operation.

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:45.906 A:middle
What I would like to do, is let

00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:48.096 A:middle
our users know how long it will

00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:50.336 A:middle
be until their order is ready

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.446 A:middle
and they can to the store and

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:51.806 A:middle
pick it up.

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:54.476 A:middle
So, what I want to do is define

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.006 A:middle
a custom success response for

00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:56.216 A:middle
that.

00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:00.036 A:middle
Towards that goal, the next step
