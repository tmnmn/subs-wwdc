who will talk to you about some

00:19:01.086 --> 00:19:02.656 A:middle
of the best practices that you

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.646 A:middle
should adopt in order to create

00:19:04.646 --> 00:19:06.616 A:middle
great voice and UI experiences

00:19:06.786 --> 00:19:07.386 A:middle
in your apps.

00:19:07.716 --> 00:19:09.046 A:middle

Hi, everyone.

00:19:21.796 --> 00:19:23.166 A:middle
So, as Amit just showed you,

00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:24.926 A:middle
it's super easy to get started

00:19:24.926 --> 00:19:25.766 A:middle
with Siri Shortcuts.

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:28.006 A:middle
Once a shortcut is donated, it

00:19:28.006 --> 00:19:29.636 A:middle
is available for the system to

00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:31.196 A:middle
suggest as a shortcut to use

00:19:31.196 --> 00:19:32.576 A:middle
with Siri straight out of the

00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:32.886 A:middle
box.

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:35.256 A:middle
I'm going to be showing you some

00:19:35.256 --> 00:19:37.176 A:middle
more new shortcuts APIs, and the

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.576 A:middle
best practices to help bring the

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:39.906 A:middle
greatest experience to our

00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:40.306 A:middle
users.

00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:41.756 A:middle
And I know you care about this

00:19:41.756 --> 00:19:43.216 A:middle
because your users are going to

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:44.796 A:middle
notice these small details and

00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:46.096 A:middle
the large amount of care that

00:19:46.096 --> 00:19:47.806 A:middle
you put into your apps.

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.446 A:middle
If you saw the first session,

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:50.676 A:middle
"Introduction to Siri

00:19:50.676 --> 00:19:51.996 A:middle
Shortcuts," you learned that

00:19:51.996 --> 00:19:53.266 A:middle
there are two ways to donate

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:53.636 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:55.486 A:middle
The first way is through NS User

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.396 A:middle
Activity.

00:19:57.336 --> 00:19:58.916 A:middle
User Activities are great if you

00:19:58.916 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
want to do a basic integration,
