00:19:58.916 --> 00:20:00.406 A:middle
want to do a basic integration,

00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:02.166 A:middle
where you just want to open the

00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:03.176 A:middle
app and show your user a

00:20:03.176 --> 00:20:04.306 A:middle
particular piece of content.

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:06.596 A:middle
And the second way is through

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:07.006 A:middle
Intents.

00:20:07.926 --> 00:20:09.346 A:middle
Intents are great if you want to

00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:10.776 A:middle
do a deeper integration where

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.656 A:middle
you can run things in the

00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:13.526 A:middle
background and inline within the

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:15.016 A:middle
Siri experience, so you don't

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:16.596 A:middle
have to context with your users

00:20:16.886 --> 00:20:17.976 A:middle
out of that to get things done.

00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:21.816 A:middle
And for both NS User Activities

00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:23.426 A:middle
and Intents, there are several

00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:24.226 A:middle
parameters that we can

00:20:24.226 --> 00:20:24.676 A:middle
configure.

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:27.296 A:middle
The first one is the title.

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:29.756 A:middle
So, in this case, Order Clam

00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:31.636 A:middle
Chowder, with the subtitle

00:20:31.636 --> 00:20:33.386 A:middle
underneath it and image next to

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:35.656 A:middle
it, and finally, a suggested

00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:37.126 A:middle
invocation phrase which you'll

00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:37.796 A:middle
get to later.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:40.276 A:middle
For each of these, we're going

00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:41.736 A:middle
to go over how best to configure

00:20:41.736 --> 00:20:41.936 A:middle
them.

00:20:42.506 --> 00:20:43.686 A:middle
So, let's get started with the

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:44.786 A:middle
title and subtitle.

00:20:45.426 --> 00:20:47.496 A:middle
So, when you're thinking about

00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:49.516 A:middle
titles and subtitles, there are

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:50.626 A:middle
two high-level things that you

00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:51.296 A:middle
should keep in mind.

00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:53.646 A:middle
First, the title should

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:55.066 A:middle
represent what happens when the

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.376 A:middle
user runs the shortcut.

00:20:56.786 --> 00:20:57.826 A:middle
Your user is going to want to

00:20:57.826 --> 00:20:59.526 A:middle
know exactly what happens before

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:00.696 A:middle
they run the shortcut or add
