00:33:59.466 --> 00:34:01.426 A:middle
will see this setup screen,

00:34:01.426 --> 00:34:02.736 A:middle
right from inside of your app.

00:34:04.186 --> 00:34:06.046 A:middle
In addition, rewrite an API to

00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:07.906 A:middle
allow users to delete and edit

00:34:07.996 --> 00:34:09.366 A:middle
any existing shortcuts.

00:34:12.976 --> 00:34:15.616 A:middle
We also have an API that lets

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:17.476 A:middle
you get a list of shortcuts that

00:34:17.476 --> 00:34:19.176 A:middle
are already added to Siri by our

00:34:19.176 --> 00:34:19.576 A:middle
users.

00:34:19.966 --> 00:34:21.485 A:middle
So, for example I can use this

00:34:21.485 --> 00:34:23.216 A:middle
information to indicate which

00:34:23.216 --> 00:34:26.286 A:middle
soups on my menu have the user

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:28.536 A:middle
has already added the shortcut

00:34:29.216 --> 00:34:30.036 A:middle
to use with Siri.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:32.485 A:middle
So, as you can see, for clam

00:34:32.485 --> 00:34:33.676 A:middle
chowder, I have "Chowder Time"

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:37.085 A:middle
associated and for tomato soup,

00:34:37.636 --> 00:34:38.916 A:middle
I have "Tomato, Tomato."

00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:42.446 A:middle
Awesome. So, to summarize, let's

00:34:42.446 --> 00:34:43.606 A:middle
go over what we learned about

00:34:43.606 --> 00:34:43.866 A:middle
today.

00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:46.396 A:middle
First, we learned that Custom

00:34:46.396 --> 00:34:47.906 A:middle
Responses are critical in

00:34:47.906 --> 00:34:49.676 A:middle
providing a great voice

00:34:49.676 --> 00:34:50.835 A:middle
experience to our users.

00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:52.676 A:middle
And Amit showed us just how

00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:55.646 A:middle
simple that can be.

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:57.906 A:middle
Next, we saw how Custom Intents

00:34:57.906 --> 00:34:59.126 A:middle
UI can help bring the apps

00:34:59.126 --> 00:35:01.086 A:middle
experience into Siri and to the
