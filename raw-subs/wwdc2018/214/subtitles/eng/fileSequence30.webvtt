00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.856 A:middle
and doesn't include the phrase,

00:30:00.936 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
"Hey, Siri."

00:30:02.056 --> 00:30:03.796 A:middle
So, this passes all of our tests

00:30:03.796 --> 00:30:04.796 A:middle
and that's awesome.

00:30:06.026 --> 00:30:07.366 A:middle
But we can't [inaudible] in

00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:10.416 A:middle
order to provide a truly great

00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:12.116 A:middle
shortcuts experience to your

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:13.996 A:middle
users, around the world, you

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:14.756 A:middle
have to make sure it's

00:30:14.756 --> 00:30:15.306 A:middle
localized.

00:30:15.666 --> 00:30:16.906 A:middle
For example, I speak both

00:30:16.906 --> 00:30:18.216 A:middle
English and Japanese, and it

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.646 A:middle
would be great if I can suggest

00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:21.646 A:middle
a Use Shortcuts in Japanese sort

00:30:21.646 --> 00:30:21.976 A:middle
of like this.

00:30:22.056 --> 00:30:24.786 A:middle
So, instead of "Chowder Time," I

00:30:24.786 --> 00:30:26.096 A:middle
can be like [foreign language

00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:27.536 A:middle
spoken] which means, "I'll eat

00:30:27.606 --> 00:30:27.996 A:middle
chowder."

00:30:28.956 --> 00:30:32.306 A:middle
To do this, we can localize.

00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:33.866 A:middle
And when we're thinking about

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:36.056 A:middle
localization, there are a couple

00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:37.116 A:middle
of things to keep in mind.

00:30:37.526 --> 00:30:39.336 A:middle
So, in addition to localizing

00:30:39.336 --> 00:30:40.556 A:middle
your code, we want to make sure

00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:42.726 A:middle
to localize the content in the

00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:44.216 A:middle
Intent Definition Files, because

00:30:44.216 --> 00:30:45.556 A:middle
as you can remember, there are a

00:30:45.556 --> 00:30:46.506 A:middle
lot of strings in there.

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:48.976 A:middle
And second, we have to think

00:30:48.976 --> 00:30:49.946 A:middle
about pluralization.

00:30:50.116 --> 00:30:51.246 A:middle
So, even if you're not

00:30:51.246 --> 00:30:52.826 A:middle
localizing to any other language

00:30:52.826 --> 00:30:54.606 A:middle
besides English, if you have to

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:56.296 A:middle
handle things like, "Order one

00:30:56.296 --> 00:30:57.856 A:middle
clam chowder," versus, "Order

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.356 A:middle
three clam chowders," you have

00:30:59.356 --> 00:31:00.526 A:middle
to think about localization.
