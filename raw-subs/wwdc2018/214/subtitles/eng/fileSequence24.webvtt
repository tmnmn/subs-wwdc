00:24:00.196 --> 00:24:00.996 A:middle
But let's take a look at the

00:24:00.996 --> 00:24:01.536 A:middle
subtitle.

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:04.136 A:middle
The subtitle says, "The best way

00:24:04.136 --> 00:24:04.756 A:middle
to get soup."

00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:07.546 A:middle
But that's basically Soup Chef's

00:24:07.576 --> 00:24:07.936 A:middle
tag line.

00:24:07.936 --> 00:24:09.506 A:middle
I already know that Soup Chef is

00:24:09.506 --> 00:24:10.516 A:middle
the best way to get my soup.

00:24:10.846 --> 00:24:12.336 A:middle
And it's not adding any extra

00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:13.816 A:middle
information that is specific to

00:24:13.816 --> 00:24:14.316 A:middle
the shortcut.

00:24:15.236 --> 00:24:18.086 A:middle
And, so that's already not good,

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:20.816 A:middle
but a more critically bad thing

00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:23.696 A:middle
is that Soup Chef recently

00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:25.096 A:middle
started offering delivery

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:26.606 A:middle
service, and I don't know where

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:27.656 A:middle
I'm getting my soup delivered

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:27.886 A:middle
to.

00:24:28.096 --> 00:24:29.326 A:middle
Am I getting it to my home, my

00:24:29.326 --> 00:24:30.626 A:middle
office, someone else's office,

00:24:30.956 --> 00:24:31.456 A:middle
no idea.

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.346 A:middle
So, let's fix that by adding a

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:34.326 A:middle
delivery location.

00:24:35.736 --> 00:24:37.216 A:middle
So, now I have "Order Clam

00:24:37.256 --> 00:24:39.136 A:middle
Chowder to 1 Apple Park Way."

00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.036 A:middle
And now I know exactly what

00:24:41.036 --> 00:24:42.776 A:middle
happens when I run the shortcut.

00:24:43.216 --> 00:24:43.936 A:middle
So, that is great.

00:24:44.586 --> 00:24:47.626 A:middle
And in the Settings UI, it might

00:24:47.626 --> 00:24:48.466 A:middle
look something like this.

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:51.336 A:middle
And this is looking pretty good.

00:24:51.336 --> 00:24:52.606 A:middle
But I think we can do a little

00:24:52.606 --> 00:24:53.036 A:middle
bit better.

00:24:53.846 --> 00:24:55.396 A:middle
So, as you can see, the Soup

00:24:55.396 --> 00:24:57.216 A:middle
Chef app icon is used for both

00:24:57.216 --> 00:24:58.586 A:middle
the Clam Chowder and Tomato Soup

00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.446 A:middle
cases, but wouldn't it be great
