00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:00.446 A:middle
There are also a lot of details

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.956 A:middle
on this screen from Soup Chef

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:04.266 A:middle
that convey to me as a user what

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:05.806 A:middle
this shortcut would exactly do.

00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:07.696 A:middle
How to get these right, we'll

00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:08.996 A:middle
talk about that in a little bit.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.006 A:middle
But for now, I would like to

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:12.696 A:middle
associate a phrase with this

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:13.086 A:middle
shortcut.

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:14.806 A:middle
Something that is short.

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:17.036 A:middle
Something that's memorable and I

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:18.146 A:middle
can say it again and again.

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:20.946 A:middle
It's not always easy to come up

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.356 A:middle
with that right in the moment,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:24.916 A:middle
so I figure that Soup Chef is

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:27.666 A:middle
suggesting I call it, Soup Time.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:28.136 A:middle
I like that.

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:29.296 A:middle
I'll take it.

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:33.406 A:middle
Now, when I record the phrase, I

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:36.916 A:middle
have a shortcut to order soup

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:37.646 A:middle
with Siri.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:39.136 A:middle
Let's try it out.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.446 A:middle
Now, when I say to Siri, "Soup

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:45.626 A:middle
Time," I'm asked to confirm

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:46.556 A:middle
whether I would like to run the

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:49.296 A:middle
intent, and when I say, "Yes,"

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:50.776 A:middle
the order is placed.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.346 A:middle
And it's that easy.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:56.446 A:middle
Your users will set up shortcuts

00:03:56.446 --> 00:03:58.176 A:middle
for things they do most often.

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
And they can use these shortcuts
