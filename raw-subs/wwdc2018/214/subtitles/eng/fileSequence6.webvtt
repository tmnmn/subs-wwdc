00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:03.686 A:middle
And finally, when things do not

00:06:03.686 --> 00:06:06.406 A:middle
work as expected, custom error

00:06:06.406 --> 00:06:07.936 A:middle
responses give you the

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.866 A:middle
opportunity to explain what went

00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:11.856 A:middle
wrong instead of just saying,

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:13.886 A:middle
"Something didn't work."

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:16.516 A:middle
The structure consists of Siri

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:18.296 A:middle
communicating to the users that

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.116 A:middle
their intent did not

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:21.116 A:middle
successfully execute, followed

00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:23.026 A:middle
by information from your app,

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:24.756 A:middle
and the interaction punctuated

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:26.696 A:middle
by Siri, advising users to

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:30.916 A:middle
continue in your apps.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.336 A:middle
Now, that we understand what

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:37.186 A:middle
custom responses are, let's take

00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:39.166 A:middle
a look at how you would adopt

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.066 A:middle
them in your apps.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:45.526 A:middle
Custom responses work hand in

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:47.466 A:middle
hand with custom intents.

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.486 A:middle
So, the first step is to define

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.636 A:middle
an intent that models the use

00:06:52.636 --> 00:06:54.056 A:middle
case you are trying to create a

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:54.746 A:middle
shortcut for.

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:58.256 A:middle
For Soup Chef, we created an

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.666 A:middle
intent called Order Soup, and it
