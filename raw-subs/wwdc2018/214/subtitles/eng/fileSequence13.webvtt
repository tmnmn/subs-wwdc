00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:01.796 A:middle
extensions, please take a look

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:04.066 A:middle
at the WWDC 2017 session,

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:05.686 A:middle
"What's New in SiriKit?"

00:13:06.596 --> 00:13:09.326 A:middle
So, we built a custom Intents UI

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:11.346 A:middle
extension for Soup Chef app.

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:13.696 A:middle
And let's see how that looks.

00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:15.506 A:middle
Again, this is where we started

00:13:15.506 --> 00:13:15.846 A:middle
out with.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.816 A:middle
But with a custom Intents UI

00:13:18.816 --> 00:13:21.376 A:middle
Extension, now I'm able to show

00:13:21.376 --> 00:13:23.836 A:middle
the users the entire invoice and

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.916 A:middle
convince that we got all the

00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:27.476 A:middle
details right, that it will be

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:29.216 A:middle
2.95, before they place the

00:13:29.216 --> 00:13:30.446 A:middle
order, which is incredibly

00:13:30.446 --> 00:13:30.826 A:middle
helpful.

00:13:32.036 --> 00:13:33.386 A:middle
Once they place the order,

00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:34.986 A:middle
instead of just saying, "It's

00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:37.846 A:middle
done," we can now show them the

00:13:37.876 --> 00:13:40.276 A:middle
receipt and reaffirm that we got

00:13:40.276 --> 00:13:41.706 A:middle
everything right and it will be

00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:42.836 A:middle
ten minutes before they should

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:45.656 A:middle
come down there.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:49.976 A:middle
Alright, so you saw how easy it

00:13:49.976 --> 00:13:52.286 A:middle
is to add support for Custom UI

00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:53.806 A:middle
and Custom Responses.

00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.056 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at how we

00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:57.756 A:middle
did that in Soup Chef.
