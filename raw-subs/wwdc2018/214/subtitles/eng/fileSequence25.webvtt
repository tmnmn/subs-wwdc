00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.446 A:middle
cases, but wouldn't it be great

00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:01.986 A:middle
if we can show an image of a

00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:02.996 A:middle
clam chowder for the clam

00:25:02.996 --> 00:25:04.306 A:middle
chowder case and an image for

00:25:04.306 --> 00:25:05.506 A:middle
the tomato soup for the tomato

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:05.916 A:middle
soup case?

00:25:06.506 --> 00:25:08.676 A:middle
Sort of like this.

00:25:08.896 --> 00:25:10.506 A:middle
And for this, we provide two

00:25:10.506 --> 00:25:10.866 A:middle
APIs.

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:12.336 A:middle
One for User Activities and

00:25:12.336 --> 00:25:13.286 A:middle
another for Intents.

00:25:13.406 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:25:16.006 --> 00:25:17.916 A:middle
So, to set some context, the

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.536 A:middle
user has just viewed one of

00:25:19.536 --> 00:25:21.626 A:middle
their past soup orders and we

00:25:21.626 --> 00:25:22.756 A:middle
want to donate it, so we can

00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:24.626 A:middle
associate it -- we can associate

00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:25.546 A:middle
that with a shortcut.

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:27.606 A:middle
So, the first thing that we want

00:25:27.606 --> 00:25:29.716 A:middle
to do is create a CS Searchable

00:25:29.926 --> 00:25:31.546 A:middle
Item Attribute Set which by the

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:32.646 A:middle
way is the same thing that you

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:33.526 A:middle
want to use if you want to

00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:35.166 A:middle
provide a subtitle to your user

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:36.566 A:middle
activity, but in this case, I

00:25:36.566 --> 00:25:37.786 A:middle
want to set an image

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.046 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:25:38.046 --> 00:25:39.766 A:middle
First, make an image with

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:40.526 A:middle
chowder.

00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:43.076 A:middle
Get the PNG data out of it and

00:25:43.216 --> 00:25:44.426 A:middle
set it as the thumbnail data

00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:45.606 A:middle
property on my Attributes.

00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:47.486 A:middle
And next, I'm going to take

00:25:47.486 --> 00:25:48.846 A:middle
those attributes, set it as the

00:25:48.846 --> 00:25:50.226 A:middle
Content Attribute Set on the

00:25:50.226 --> 00:25:51.876 A:middle
User Activity, and finally I'm

00:25:51.876 --> 00:25:52.826 A:middle
going to donate the User

00:25:52.826 --> 00:25:54.186 A:middle
Activity by setting it as the

00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:55.786 A:middle
User Activity property on my

00:25:55.786 --> 00:25:56.346 A:middle
view controller.

00:25:56.766 --> 00:25:59.786 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how it

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:00.586 A:middle
works during Intents.
