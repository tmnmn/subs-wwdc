00:15:59.766 --> 00:16:01.156 A:middle
the template for it.

00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:06.866 A:middle
"Sorry, Soup is Out of Stock."

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:11.666 A:middle
And with that, we have defined

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.876 A:middle
our custom responses.

00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:14.796 A:middle
Now, let's head over to the

00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:15.976 A:middle
Intent Handler file.

00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:27.956 A:middle
Alright, here we are.

00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:30.686 A:middle
As you see here, we have a

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:32.556 A:middle
Confirm and a Handle Method.

00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:34.356 A:middle
Let's look at Confirm first.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.776 A:middle
We find out which soup the user

00:16:36.776 --> 00:16:39.926 A:middle
has requested, and then check

00:16:39.926 --> 00:16:41.276 A:middle
with our menu manager whether

00:16:41.276 --> 00:16:42.896 A:middle
that soup exists on our menu.

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:44.946 A:middle
If it does, we return the

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:45.866 A:middle
response code "Ready."

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:48.786 A:middle
What I would like to do here, is

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:50.926 A:middle
to check whether that soup item

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:53.016 A:middle
is available currently to order.

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.516 A:middle
So first, let's grab reference

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.206 A:middle
to the menu item from our menu

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:57.566 A:middle
manager.

00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:00.986 A:middle
Then, I'm going to check if it's
