00:28:00.016 --> 00:28:01.336 A:middle
"Hey user, you can say something

00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:02.546 A:middle
like, 'Chowder Time.'"

00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:04.746 A:middle
And of course, we have an API

00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:05.846 A:middle
for this, so let's take a look.

00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:08.066 A:middle
So, building on a previous

00:28:08.066 --> 00:28:09.596 A:middle
example, all we have to do is

00:28:09.626 --> 00:28:10.586 A:middle
add one line.

00:28:11.336 --> 00:28:12.766 A:middle
So, User Activity has a property

00:28:12.766 --> 00:28:14.246 A:middle
called Suggested Indication

00:28:14.246 --> 00:28:14.516 A:middle
Phrase.

00:28:14.516 --> 00:28:15.666 A:middle
And I'm going to set that to

00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:16.256 A:middle
Chowder Time.

00:28:17.206 --> 00:28:18.576 A:middle
And for Intents, it's the exact

00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:18.996 A:middle
same thing.

00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:21.326 A:middle
Intents also have a property

00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:22.886 A:middle
called Suggested Indication

00:28:22.886 --> 00:28:24.316 A:middle
Phrase which I'll also set to

00:28:24.346 --> 00:28:24.946 A:middle
"Chowder Time."

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.346 A:middle
So, the API for this as you can

00:28:27.346 --> 00:28:28.436 A:middle
see, is super simple.

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:30.356 A:middle
But what actually makes a good

00:28:30.356 --> 00:28:31.686 A:middle
suggested invocation phrase?

00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:35.896 A:middle
So, the most important thing to

00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:37.596 A:middle
keep in mind is that the

00:28:37.656 --> 00:28:39.246 A:middle
suggested invocation phrase is

00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:40.796 A:middle
both short and memorable.

00:28:41.106 --> 00:28:42.436 A:middle
You have to remember that your

00:28:42.436 --> 00:28:43.326 A:middle
users are going to have to say

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:45.116 A:middle
this phrase exactly every,

00:28:45.116 --> 00:28:45.966 A:middle
single time they run their

00:28:45.966 --> 00:28:46.436 A:middle
shortcut.

00:28:46.806 --> 00:28:47.736 A:middle
So, ideally it would be

00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:48.876 A:middle
somewhere between two to three

00:28:48.876 --> 00:28:49.330 A:middle
words.

00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:53.016 A:middle
Next, it's important to not

00:28:53.016 --> 00:28:54.846 A:middle
include the phrase, "Hey Siri,"

00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:56.896 A:middle
in your shortcut phrase, because

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:58.736 A:middle
if your user accidentally sets

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.286 A:middle
their shortcut phrase as "Hey,
