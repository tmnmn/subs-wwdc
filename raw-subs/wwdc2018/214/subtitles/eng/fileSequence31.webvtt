00:30:59.356 --> 00:31:00.526 A:middle
to think about localization.

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:02.866 A:middle
And to learn about all of this

00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:03.506 A:middle
stuff, check out the

00:31:03.506 --> 00:31:05.446 A:middle
Localization Session and their

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:05.776 A:middle
labs.

00:31:06.126 --> 00:31:07.096 A:middle
They'll teach you everything

00:31:07.096 --> 00:31:08.026 A:middle
that you need to know, and more.

00:31:09.306 --> 00:31:09.646 A:middle
So, cool.

00:31:09.646 --> 00:31:11.346 A:middle
For now, let's go back to

00:31:11.376 --> 00:31:11.666 A:middle
English.

00:31:12.386 --> 00:31:15.306 A:middle
Now, that we've followed these

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:16.856 A:middle
best practices, when we go to

00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:17.606 A:middle
the Settings UI, you are

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.526 A:middle
presented with a beautiful list

00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:20.836 A:middle
of suggested shortcuts.

00:31:21.356 --> 00:31:22.916 A:middle
And right now, these are based

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.906 A:middle
on a combination of suggestions

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.056 A:middle
based on the user's past

00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:27.276 A:middle
routines and the things that the

00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:28.196 A:middle
user did recently.

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:30.686 A:middle
But in addition, we provide an

00:31:30.686 --> 00:31:32.356 A:middle
API to allow developers to

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:33.676 A:middle
suggest their own shortcuts.

00:31:34.176 --> 00:31:35.456 A:middle
And this is useful because this

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:36.856 A:middle
allows you to suggest things for

00:31:36.856 --> 00:31:37.886 A:middle
things that the user hasn't

00:31:37.886 --> 00:31:39.536 A:middle
necessarily done yet or hasn't

00:31:39.536 --> 00:31:40.126 A:middle
done recently.

00:31:40.836 --> 00:31:42.326 A:middle
For example, if you have a music

00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:43.936 A:middle
app, you might want to offer a

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:45.366 A:middle
shortcut for playing a

00:31:45.366 --> 00:31:46.726 A:middle
particular playlist, even if the

00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:48.206 A:middle
user hasn't played it before or

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.216 A:middle
hasn't played it recently,

00:31:49.466 --> 00:31:51.566 A:middle
because presumably, if a user

00:31:51.566 --> 00:31:52.786 A:middle
has created the playlist, they

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:53.786 A:middle
probably ought to play it at

00:31:53.856 --> 00:31:54.646 A:middle
some point in the future.

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.476 A:middle
So, in the Soup Chef app, I

00:31:57.476 --> 00:31:58.796 A:middle
think it'd be great if we can

00:31:58.796 --> 00:32:01.236 A:middle
suggest a shortcut for ordering
