00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:00.036 A:middle
Towards that goal, the next step

00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:05.436 A:middle
is to declare the response

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:07.316 A:middle
properties that you will use in

00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:08.566 A:middle
your templates to provide

00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:11.116 A:middle
information at run time.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:12.476 A:middle
So, if you go over to the

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.026 A:middle
Properties Section, I'm going to

00:08:15.026 --> 00:08:16.896 A:middle
add a Wait Time and a Soup

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:17.366 A:middle
Property.

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:21.466 A:middle
With that in place, the only

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:22.396 A:middle
thing left to do in our

00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:24.146 A:middle
definition of custom responses

00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:26.556 A:middle
is to define the template.

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:28.966 A:middle
The template is what is spoken

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:29.736 A:middle
out by Siri.

00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:32.895 A:middle
So, when we look at the template

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.446 A:middle
section of our Intent Definition

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:37.236 A:middle
File, now I'm going to add my

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:38.135 A:middle
success template.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:40.506 A:middle
Not just that.

00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:42.576 A:middle
Our store is getting a little

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:43.976 A:middle
popular and we tend to run out

00:08:43.976 --> 00:08:44.826 A:middle
of soup these days.

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:47.096 A:middle
So, it will be great if instead

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:48.566 A:middle
of just throwing a random error,

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:50.266 A:middle
I can let the users know that

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.166 A:middle
the soup is out of stock.

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:54.386 A:middle
So, I will add another response

00:08:54.386 --> 00:08:55.946 A:middle
code called, "Failure Out of

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.916 A:middle
Stock," with a template that

00:08:57.916 --> 00:08:59.416 A:middle
communicates that the soup is

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:02.806 A:middle
out of stock.
