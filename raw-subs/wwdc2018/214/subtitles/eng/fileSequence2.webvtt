00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:00.156 A:middle
with Siri.

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.976 A:middle
My teammates and I have been

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:06.776 A:middle
working on this app called Soup

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:06.966 A:middle
Chef.

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.076 A:middle
It lets you order soup.

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:13.376 A:middle
Now Soup Chef adopts all our new

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:16.356 A:middle
shortcut APIs, and every time a

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:18.836 A:middle
user places an order, Soup Chef

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.526 A:middle
lets the system know by donating

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:24.016 A:middle
a custom intent to Siri.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:27.026 A:middle
So, yesterday, I ordered some

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:27.666 A:middle
tomato soup.

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.066 A:middle
And it was really great.

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:32.396 A:middle
So much so, that I would like to

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:33.116 A:middle
order it again.

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.446 A:middle
And wouldn't it be great if I

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:36.686 A:middle
can just do that from Siri?

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:40.566 A:middle
Well, now we can.

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:41.906 A:middle
So, when we go to Siri's

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.236 A:middle
Settings UI, you see that Siri's

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:46.586 A:middle
already suggesting that donated

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:48.496 A:middle
intent to be created into a

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:48.956 A:middle
shortcut.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.186 A:middle
So, let's tap on it.

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:53.716 A:middle
And we are presented with this

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.416 A:middle
screen, where we can set up a

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.506 A:middle
phrase that you can say to Siri

00:02:57.506 --> 00:02:58.536 A:middle
and perform your shortcut.

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:00.446 A:middle
There are also a lot of details
