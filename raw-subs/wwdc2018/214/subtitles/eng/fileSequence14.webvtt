00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:16.096 A:middle
Alright, what you see here is

00:14:16.096 --> 00:14:16.976 A:middle
our app Soup Chef.

00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:20.356 A:middle
If we go to the Intents

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:22.216 A:middle
Definition File, you can see

00:14:22.216 --> 00:14:24.366 A:middle
that we have a custom order soup

00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:25.166 A:middle
intent defined.

00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:28.446 A:middle
This intent is off-category

00:14:28.686 --> 00:14:29.036 A:middle
order.

00:14:29.576 --> 00:14:32.386 A:middle
Now, let's look at the response

00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:33.776 A:middle
section that is associated with

00:14:33.776 --> 00:14:34.336 A:middle
my intent.

00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:37.266 A:middle
Here, I have properties and

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:38.006 A:middle
template sections.

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:40.146 A:middle
What I would like to do is add

00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:42.876 A:middle
the custom success response that

00:14:42.876 --> 00:14:44.036 A:middle
we just talked about.

00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:46.386 A:middle
So, let's start by adding the

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.326 A:middle
wait time property.

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:50.206 A:middle
I'll click the Plus button, and

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:52.176 A:middle
name my property Wait Time.

00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:53.896 A:middle
I'll leave it of the Type

00:14:53.896 --> 00:14:56.046 A:middle
String, so I can format the date

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:57.816 A:middle
however I see fit before

00:14:57.816 --> 00:14:59.176 A:middle
providing it into the dialogue.
