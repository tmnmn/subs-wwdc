00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:02.936 A:middle
But this is our chance to also

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.656 A:middle
check that the soup is available

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:05.516 A:middle
right now, and that we can place

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:05.976 A:middle
the order of that.

00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:08.766 A:middle
So, let's do that.

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:11.196 A:middle
First, I'll grab a reference to

00:10:11.196 --> 00:10:11.936 A:middle
my menu item.

00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:15.036 A:middle
Then check if it's available.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:17.626 A:middle
And if it isn't, I'm going to

00:10:17.626 --> 00:10:19.406 A:middle
call the Completion Handler with

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:21.246 A:middle
our new custom Failure Out of

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.216 A:middle
Stock Response Code.

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:25.866 A:middle
If everything looks great, we'll

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:27.526 A:middle
continue as before.

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.216 A:middle
This is also our chance to

00:10:30.216 --> 00:10:32.696 A:middle
provide custom response --

00:10:32.696 --> 00:10:34.176 A:middle
custom confirmation response.

00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:36.026 A:middle
Support for those will be coming

00:10:36.026 --> 00:10:37.176 A:middle
in upcoming [inaudible].

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:40.176 A:middle
Alright, that was confirmation.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:43.596 A:middle
Now, it's time to handle the

00:10:43.596 --> 00:10:43.966 A:middle
intent.

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:46.276 A:middle
For us, that means to place the

00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:46.956 A:middle
order for the soup.

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:49.466 A:middle
So, I'm going to build an order

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:51.256 A:middle
from all the information that is

00:10:51.296 --> 00:10:52.636 A:middle
present on my intent.

00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:55.896 A:middle
And then place the order with

00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:56.616 A:middle
our Order Manager.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.846 A:middle
And if it's successful, we'll

00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
let the system know, by calling
