00:28:59.226 --> 00:29:01.706 A:middle
entity and keep it independent

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
of the user interface.

00:29:03.656 --> 00:29:05.776 A:middle
Just like how we've done here.

00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:08.816 A:middle
When it comes to actually saving

00:29:08.816 --> 00:29:10.306 A:middle
and retrieving the data on the

00:29:10.306 --> 00:29:13.266 A:middle
back end, we have a few

00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:14.276 A:middle
different options.

00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:18.146 A:middle
One is to use core data.

00:29:18.146 --> 00:29:21.536 A:middle
Core data is great for managing

00:29:21.906 --> 00:29:23.136 A:middle
objects on the disc.

00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:26.056 A:middle
It provides you with solutions

00:29:26.686 --> 00:29:29.046 A:middle
to validate, query, filter, and

00:29:29.046 --> 00:29:30.506 A:middle
organize your objects.

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:34.756 A:middle
If however your data is on a web

00:29:34.826 --> 00:29:36.936 A:middle
server somewhere, then you could

00:29:36.936 --> 00:29:40.106 A:middle
use NSURLSessions to download

00:29:40.106 --> 00:29:42.706 A:middle
and upload the data.

00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:44.936 A:middle
Another great option is to use

00:29:44.936 --> 00:29:47.226 A:middle
CloudKit for storing data on the

00:29:47.326 --> 00:29:47.696 A:middle
cloud.

00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:50.686 A:middle
You could even use a third-party

00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:52.656 A:middle
cloud provider to manage your

00:29:52.656 --> 00:29:53.336 A:middle
cloud data.

00:29:53.336 --> 00:29:55.476 A:middle
Now that we've set up our data,

00:29:56.286 --> 00:29:58.666 A:middle
let's move onto the next section

00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:00.396 A:middle
where we build our user
