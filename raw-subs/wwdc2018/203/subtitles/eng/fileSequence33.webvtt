00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:01.246 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add the

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.066 A:middle
details UI.

00:33:02.066 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
I'll go back into the object

00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:07.686 A:middle
library, and this time we'll

00:33:07.686 --> 00:33:10.176 A:middle
take a blank view controller and

00:33:10.176 --> 00:33:11.896 A:middle
bring it into the storyboard.

00:33:14.236 --> 00:33:16.876 A:middle
Inside this view controller, we

00:33:16.876 --> 00:33:18.526 A:middle
will add an image view.

00:33:22.076 --> 00:33:24.036 A:middle
Let me set the image from the

00:33:24.036 --> 00:33:25.366 A:middle
Attributes Inspector.

00:33:27.076 --> 00:33:27.786 A:middle
Wait a minute.

00:33:27.786 --> 00:33:29.676 A:middle
This is a little scaled.

00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:32.676 A:middle
Let me change the content mode

00:33:32.676 --> 00:33:36.016 A:middle
from scale to aspect fit.

00:33:36.016 --> 00:33:36.656 A:middle
Much better.

00:33:37.796 --> 00:33:39.376 A:middle
Now I'll go back to the object

00:33:39.376 --> 00:33:40.976 A:middle
library and add some labels.

00:33:44.046 --> 00:33:45.356 A:middle
These are going to be used for

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.456 A:middle
storing the name.

00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:48.186 A:middle
I'll make a copy.

00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:51.516 A:middle
Next one is for the rank, and

00:33:51.606 --> 00:33:53.146 A:middle
finally another label.

00:33:53.846 --> 00:33:54.716 A:middle
Going to make a copy.

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:56.256 A:middle
Another label for the points.

00:33:57.496 --> 00:34:00.186 A:middle
Okay. Now that both our view
