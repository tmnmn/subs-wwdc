00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:22.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone!

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:23.846 A:middle
Good morning!

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:28.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:29.766 A:middle
Thanks, everyone, for being here

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:30.136 A:middle
today.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:31.516 A:middle
My name's Jesse Pease.

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:32.476 A:middle
And I'm an engineer on the

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:33.666 A:middle
Health Engineering Team.

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.266 A:middle
And today, I'm going to show you

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.606 A:middle
how to make your very first app.

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.286 A:middle
So today we're going to step out

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:41.256 A:middle
of our comfort zones.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:42.736 A:middle
We're going to explore, and

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:44.006 A:middle
we're going to start building

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:44.866 A:middle
our dream app.

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:46.206 A:middle
You know that one that you've

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:47.316 A:middle
had in the back of your mind

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:48.216 A:middle
while you're waiting in line for

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.016 A:middle
your coffee in the morning?

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.716 A:middle
Or that one that you drew out on

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.306 A:middle
your napkin on the flight out

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.096 A:middle
here to WWDC?

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:54.746 A:middle
Or that one that you tell your

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:55.676 A:middle
friends about and make them

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:57.256 A:middle
promise not to tell anyone else?

00:00:58.136 --> 00:00:59.446 A:middle
That one. That's the idea we're

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.286 A:middle
going to start working on today.
