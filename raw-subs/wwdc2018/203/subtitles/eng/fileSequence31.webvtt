00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.726 A:middle
I'll select the main storyboard

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:06.966 A:middle
which we built with Jesse.

00:31:07.156 --> 00:31:08.006 A:middle
Here we have a

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:10.626 A:middle
single-view-controller which was

00:31:10.626 --> 00:31:12.766 A:middle
used to manage the entire screen

00:31:12.766 --> 00:31:14.156 A:middle
of content for the game.

00:31:15.396 --> 00:31:17.706 A:middle
Now we want to add more screens

00:31:18.386 --> 00:31:20.506 A:middle
for displaying our leaderboard

00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:21.586 A:middle
in the details view.

00:31:22.656 --> 00:31:25.236 A:middle
To do this, we can add another

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:27.066 A:middle
view controller from the object

00:31:27.066 --> 00:31:27.646 A:middle
library.

00:31:28.426 --> 00:31:29.986 A:middle
I'll search for view controller.

00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:32.666 A:middle
Notice that there are a few

00:31:32.666 --> 00:31:34.026 A:middle
different options for view

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:34.716 A:middle
controllers.

00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:37.356 A:middle
Since I want my leaderboard to

00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:39.416 A:middle
look more like a table, I'll

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:41.296 A:middle
select the table-view-controller

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:43.516 A:middle
and bring it into my storyboard.

00:31:46.186 --> 00:31:47.626 A:middle
The table-view-controller

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:50.756 A:middle
automatically has a table view.

00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:53.196 A:middle
Let's select the table view and

00:31:53.196 --> 00:31:56.166 A:middle
look at the Attributes Inspector

00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:56.816 A:middle
on the right.

00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.956 A:middle
The content type here is set to
