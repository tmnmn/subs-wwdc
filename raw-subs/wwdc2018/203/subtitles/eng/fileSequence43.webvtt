00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.996 A:middle
that we wrote before to save the

00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:01.446 A:middle
points.

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:06.186 A:middle
The-- this save points method

00:43:06.186 --> 00:43:07.646 A:middle
takes two parameters.

00:43:08.536 --> 00:43:10.456 A:middle
One is the total points which

00:43:11.226 --> 00:43:13.106 A:middle
we've already saved in the game

00:43:13.106 --> 00:43:14.066 A:middle
points variable.

00:43:15.336 --> 00:43:18.746 A:middle
The second parameter is the name

00:43:18.746 --> 00:43:20.036 A:middle
of the user who's playing the

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:20.376 A:middle
game.

00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:22.896 A:middle
So to recap, I've just added

00:43:22.896 --> 00:43:24.826 A:middle
this little bit of code in our

00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.876 A:middle
view controller that we created

00:43:26.876 --> 00:43:27.356 A:middle
before.

00:43:28.066 --> 00:43:30.466 A:middle
The save points method on our

00:43:30.546 --> 00:43:32.926 A:middle
game data model takes two

00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:33.706 A:middle
parameters.

00:43:34.336 --> 00:43:36.266 A:middle
The first is the game points

00:43:36.956 --> 00:43:39.026 A:middle
which we had already stored in a

00:43:39.026 --> 00:43:39.616 A:middle
variable.

00:43:40.596 --> 00:43:44.346 A:middle
The second parameter is the name

00:43:44.346 --> 00:43:45.776 A:middle
of the user who's playing the

00:43:45.776 --> 00:43:46.156 A:middle
game.

00:43:47.476 --> 00:43:49.916 A:middle
In a real-world app, you would

00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:51.866 A:middle
probably want to create a

00:43:51.866 --> 00:43:53.636 A:middle
profile screen or a settings

00:43:53.636 --> 00:43:55.946 A:middle
screen where the user can enter

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:56.726 A:middle
their own name.

00:43:57.496 --> 00:43:59.056 A:middle
But for the purposes of this

00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:01.566 A:middle
demo, I'll just hardcode this to
