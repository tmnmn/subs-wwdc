00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:01.036 A:middle
view controller which had the

00:36:01.036 --> 00:36:01.556 A:middle
game.

00:36:02.516 --> 00:36:04.206 A:middle
And then go to the editor menu

00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:07.186 A:middle
in Xcode, select, embed in,

00:36:07.526 --> 00:36:08.906 A:middle
navigation controller.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:12.676 A:middle
This adds a navigation

00:36:12.676 --> 00:36:13.796 A:middle
controller to our app.

00:36:14.536 --> 00:36:16.816 A:middle
The navigation controller is a

00:36:16.816 --> 00:36:18.776 A:middle
special type of view controller

00:36:19.216 --> 00:36:21.266 A:middle
that is used for managing the

00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:22.956 A:middle
back and forth transitions

00:36:23.056 --> 00:36:24.736 A:middle
between our view controllers.

00:36:26.066 --> 00:36:29.046 A:middle
This also adds a navigation bar

00:36:29.046 --> 00:36:30.466 A:middle
at the top of our view

00:36:30.466 --> 00:36:31.146 A:middle
controllers.

00:36:31.146 --> 00:36:33.256 A:middle
So from the Attributes

00:36:33.256 --> 00:36:36.226 A:middle
Inspector, if I set a title to--

00:36:36.646 --> 00:36:38.856 A:middle
for my leaderboard, it will now

00:36:38.856 --> 00:36:41.556 A:middle
show up in the navigation bar.

00:36:42.936 --> 00:36:44.966 A:middle
Now that we've added all the

00:36:44.966 --> 00:36:46.586 A:middle
viewers that we needed to add

00:36:46.686 --> 00:36:47.396 A:middle
for our UI.

00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:50.616 A:middle
Let me finish this up with

00:36:50.616 --> 00:36:53.066 A:middle
adding an app icon to this app.

00:36:54.376 --> 00:36:55.656 A:middle
Let's go into our project

00:36:55.656 --> 00:36:56.426 A:middle
navigator.

00:36:57.156 --> 00:36:59.276 A:middle
Select the blue folder that says

00:36:59.556 --> 00:36:59.876 A:middle
assets.
