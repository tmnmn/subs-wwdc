00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.956 A:middle
The content type here is set to

00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:02.316 A:middle
dynamic prototypes.

00:32:03.206 --> 00:32:04.836 A:middle
I'll change this to static

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:05.296 A:middle
cells.

00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:08.216 A:middle
Static cells are great for

00:32:08.216 --> 00:32:09.656 A:middle
displaying static data.

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:12.316 A:middle
And these can be easily set up

00:32:12.466 --> 00:32:13.416 A:middle
in the storyboard.

00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:17.146 A:middle
Now let's select a single cell

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:19.516 A:middle
and change its style from the

00:32:19.516 --> 00:32:21.186 A:middle
Attributes Inspector to

00:32:21.246 --> 00:32:21.966 A:middle
subtitle.

00:32:23.456 --> 00:32:25.126 A:middle
This gives me a title and a

00:32:25.126 --> 00:32:27.386 A:middle
subtitle where I can display the

00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:28.876 A:middle
name and the points on my

00:32:28.876 --> 00:32:29.486 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:33.426 A:middle
I also want to add an image to

00:32:33.426 --> 00:32:34.496 A:middle
the left of the row.

00:32:35.476 --> 00:32:38.136 A:middle
To do this, I can simply type in

00:32:38.136 --> 00:32:39.986 A:middle
the name of an image in the

00:32:39.986 --> 00:32:42.086 A:middle
Attributes Inspector's image

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:42.736 A:middle
field here.

00:32:43.856 --> 00:32:46.776 A:middle
I have imported an image in my

00:32:46.846 --> 00:32:48.686 A:middle
project just as a sample.

00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:51.306 A:middle
Let me add that.

00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:55.666 A:middle
Okay. So now my cell is all set

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:57.776 A:middle
up and we have a good outline

00:32:57.776 --> 00:32:58.716 A:middle
for our leaderboard.

00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:01.246 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add the
