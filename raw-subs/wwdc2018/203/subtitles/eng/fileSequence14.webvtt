00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:00.646 A:middle
the very beginning of my game.

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:03.126 A:middle
Now I also need some variables

00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.416 A:middle
to keep track of my gameplay

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:05.046 A:middle
over time.

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:06.626 A:middle
And I've already written these,

00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:08.126 A:middle
so I'll quickly add them using a

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:08.606 A:middle
shortcut.

00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:12.466 A:middle
One of them needs to be, it's

00:14:12.826 --> 00:14:13.736 A:middle
already initialized, but I

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.176 A:middle
actually need to populate it

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:15.706 A:middle
with some data.

00:14:15.706 --> 00:14:17.746 A:middle
And that's this game buttons

00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:18.146 A:middle
list.

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:19.926 A:middle
Now you're thinking to yourself,

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:21.716 A:middle
"Jessie, if we only have a

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:23.326 A:middle
unicorn and a poop, why would we

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:25.086 A:middle
need to create a whole array of

00:14:25.086 --> 00:14:25.546 A:middle
buttons?"

00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:27.826 A:middle
Well, in our case we want to

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.426 A:middle
make our code more extensible

00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:30.956 A:middle
which means make it easier to

00:14:30.956 --> 00:14:32.036 A:middle
build on over time.

00:14:32.366 --> 00:14:34.056 A:middle
Because in the future, we may

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:35.186 A:middle
have more than just the unicorn

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:35.916 A:middle
and the poop.

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.266 A:middle
We may have a thumbs-up emoji.

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:39.306 A:middle
We may have a frowny-face emoji.

00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:41.556 A:middle
So in this case, we want to say

00:14:42.346 --> 00:14:47.436 A:middle
that game buttons equals list of

00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:50.256 A:middle
good button and bad button.

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:53.856 A:middle
Okay. I've also written some

00:14:53.856 --> 00:14:55.476 A:middle
helper methods that will help us

00:14:55.476 --> 00:14:56.316 A:middle
with our gameplay.

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.266 A:middle
I'm going to add those now.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.866 A:middle
One of them is this method
