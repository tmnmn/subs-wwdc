00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:02.596 A:middle
this start game button and hit

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:02.896 A:middle
connect.

00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:05.776 A:middle
Awesome. Now we have a

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:07.586 A:middle
connection between our code and

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:08.356 A:middle
our storyboard.

00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:09.806 A:middle
And we can double check that

00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:10.696 A:middle
this connection was made

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:13.226 A:middle
correctly, by seeing this little

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.976 A:middle
gray circle to left of

00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:15.836 A:middle
start-game button.

00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:17.896 A:middle
If we hover over it, it

00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:18.916 A:middle
highlights the item on our

00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.986 A:middle
storyboard that is connected to

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:22.416 A:middle
this code.

00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:25.036 A:middle
Now, in the interest of time,

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.546 A:middle
I've already written the code

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:27.866 A:middle
for our other outlets.

00:10:28.346 --> 00:10:29.736 A:middle
But you'll notice that to the

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.106 A:middle
left of them, they have open

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:31.646 A:middle
circles.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.126 A:middle
This means that they haven't

00:10:33.126 --> 00:10:34.416 A:middle
been connected to our storyboard

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:34.556 A:middle
yet.

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
To make the connections, we just

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:38.716 A:middle
click inside the circle to the

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.246 A:middle
left of good button in this

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:40.626 A:middle
case.

00:10:40.856 --> 00:10:42.586 A:middle
And drag over to our unicorn

00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:43.796 A:middle
button which is the button we

00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:45.226 A:middle
want to be associated with this

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:45.776 A:middle
line of code.

00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:46.626 A:middle
And let go.

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:49.276 A:middle
We'll do the same thing for bad

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:53.836 A:middle
button, leaderboard button, and

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:54.506 A:middle
points label.

00:10:55.776 --> 00:10:57.016 A:middle
Awesome. Now all of these

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:58.116 A:middle
connections have been made.

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
Now another type of connection
