00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.486 A:middle
that's on screen is a unicorn,

00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:03.216 A:middle
then the game is over.

00:20:03.586 --> 00:20:05.326 A:middle
Because the user left a lonely

00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:07.716 A:middle
unicorn again.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.806 A:middle
Otherwise, if they successfully

00:20:09.806 --> 00:20:11.116 A:middle
avoided the poop and that's

00:20:11.116 --> 00:20:12.796 A:middle
still onscreen, they get another

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:13.616 A:middle
round of our game.

00:20:15.056 --> 00:20:15.826 A:middle
Now let's talk about what

00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:17.346 A:middle
happens if they did press one of

00:20:17.346 --> 00:20:18.026 A:middle
our buttons.

00:20:18.626 --> 00:20:19.636 A:middle
Well if they pressed the good

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:20.676 A:middle
button, we want to give them

00:20:20.676 --> 00:20:21.306 A:middle
another point.

00:20:21.996 --> 00:20:24.726 A:middle
We actually want to cancel our

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:25.176 A:middle
timer.

00:20:25.176 --> 00:20:26.296 A:middle
And we're going to do this by

00:20:26.296 --> 00:20:27.716 A:middle
invalidating it so that it

00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
doesn't go off, and then we'll

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:32.936 A:middle
call another round of our game.

00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:34.176 A:middle
And if they press the bad

00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:36.176 A:middle
button, well let's hide that

00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:37.376 A:middle
button and get it out of the way

00:20:37.376 --> 00:20:38.586 A:middle
so that they can't interact with

00:20:38.586 --> 00:20:39.046 A:middle
it again.

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:41.176 A:middle
We'll cancel the timer again by

00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:42.756 A:middle
calling invalidate on it.

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:45.736 A:middle
And then call game over which is

00:20:45.736 --> 00:20:46.686 A:middle
a helpful method that I've

00:20:46.686 --> 00:20:49.946 A:middle
written to help end the game.

00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:52.016 A:middle
Okay, let's add this game logic

00:20:52.016 --> 00:20:53.226 A:middle
into our game.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:57.936 A:middle
Going to go back over to our

00:20:58.036 --> 00:20:58.886 A:middle
Xcode project.

00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:01.896 A:middle
And in this case, I don't need
