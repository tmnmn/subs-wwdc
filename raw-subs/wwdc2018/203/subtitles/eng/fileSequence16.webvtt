00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:00.466 A:middle
to my console.

00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:03.666 A:middle
I can show my debug area by

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:05.466 A:middle
opening up this middle button

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:07.146 A:middle
here with the line on the bottom

00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
of the square.

00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:09.936 A:middle
I'm going to hide my Inspector

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:10.266 A:middle
pane.

00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:11.126 A:middle
I don't need that anymore.

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:13.816 A:middle
Okay. It's finally time.

00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:15.426 A:middle
We can build and run our app.

00:16:15.956 --> 00:16:17.036 A:middle
Now in the upper left-hand

00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:18.676 A:middle
corner, you'll notice that my

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.206 A:middle
app name, Disappearing Unicorns,

00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:21.876 A:middle
with a little arrow to an iPhone

00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:22.176 A:middle
10.

00:16:22.756 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
If I click on iPhone 10, I can

00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:26.276 A:middle
see all the different simulators

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:27.456 A:middle
that I can run my app on.

00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:30.046 A:middle
Now a simulator is a simulation

00:16:30.176 --> 00:16:31.526 A:middle
of a device on my Mac.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:33.686 A:middle
And in this case, I want to

00:16:33.686 --> 00:16:34.676 A:middle
select iPhone 10.

00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:37.016 A:middle
Now if I had plugged my phone

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:39.036 A:middle
into my computer, I could also

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:40.646 A:middle
build and run my app on my own

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.236 A:middle
device which is pretty cool.

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:45.396 A:middle
So with iPhone 10 selected, I

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.456 A:middle
can click this play button here.

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.996 A:middle
This will build and run my app

00:16:49.256 --> 00:16:50.026 A:middle
in my simulator.

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
Here we go.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.566 A:middle
Oh, nice! Okay, so when I press
