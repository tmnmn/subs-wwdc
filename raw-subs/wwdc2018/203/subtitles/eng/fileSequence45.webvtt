00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:00.036 A:middle
has been generated for us by

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:00.726 A:middle
Xcode.

00:45:01.536 --> 00:45:03.156 A:middle
These are methods that

00:45:03.646 --> 00:45:05.956 A:middle
developers find useful when

00:45:05.956 --> 00:45:06.756 A:middle
building their own

00:45:06.756 --> 00:45:07.916 A:middle
table-view-controllers.

00:45:08.976 --> 00:45:11.016 A:middle
We will implement two of these

00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:11.536 A:middle
methods.

00:45:12.766 --> 00:45:15.666 A:middle
First is a table view number of

00:45:15.736 --> 00:45:16.866 A:middle
rows in sections.

00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:20.916 A:middle
This method is asking us for the

00:45:21.066 --> 00:45:22.906 A:middle
total number of rows that we

00:45:22.906 --> 00:45:24.576 A:middle
want to display in our table

00:45:24.576 --> 00:45:24.836 A:middle
view.

00:45:25.966 --> 00:45:28.416 A:middle
In our case, the total number of

00:45:28.466 --> 00:45:30.656 A:middle
rows will be the same as the

00:45:30.766 --> 00:45:32.146 A:middle
total number of players that

00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:33.336 A:middle
have played the game.

00:45:33.336 --> 00:45:36.026 A:middle
And we can get this information

00:45:36.026 --> 00:45:37.736 A:middle
again from our data model.

00:45:38.706 --> 00:45:40.586 A:middle
So the number of players

00:45:40.586 --> 00:45:42.836 A:middle
variable will give us the total

00:45:42.836 --> 00:45:43.616 A:middle
number of rows.

00:45:45.056 --> 00:45:46.986 A:middle
The second method that we need

00:45:46.986 --> 00:45:49.396 A:middle
to implement is the cell

00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:50.226 A:middle
[inaudible] at index path

00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:50.976 A:middle
method.

00:45:52.536 --> 00:45:55.906 A:middle
This method is called every time

00:45:56.116 --> 00:45:59.006 A:middle
a cell needs to be displayed on

00:45:59.006 --> 00:45:59.746 A:middle
our leaderboard.
