00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:00.396 A:middle
where we build our user

00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:00.956 A:middle
interface.

00:30:03.096 --> 00:30:03.856 A:middle
Here's what we want our

00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:05.116 A:middle
leaderboard to look like.

00:30:06.476 --> 00:30:08.276 A:middle
I'll break this down into the

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:09.936 A:middle
different viewers on the screen.

00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:13.766 A:middle
On the top we have a navigation

00:30:13.766 --> 00:30:14.056 A:middle
bar.

00:30:15.306 --> 00:30:18.846 A:middle
Below that is a table view which

00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:20.896 A:middle
has rows which are known as

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.226 A:middle
table view cells.

00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:26.376 A:middle
Within each cell, we have an

00:30:26.456 --> 00:30:29.266 A:middle
image view on the left, and some

00:30:29.266 --> 00:30:31.706 A:middle
labels on the right to display

00:30:31.706 --> 00:30:31.966 A:middle
text.

00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:36.006 A:middle
Besides the leaderboard, we also

00:30:36.006 --> 00:30:37.786 A:middle
need to set up the details page.

00:30:37.786 --> 00:30:39.766 A:middle
This one's pretty

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:40.656 A:middle
straightforward.

00:30:41.236 --> 00:30:43.316 A:middle
It has an image view and some

00:30:43.316 --> 00:30:43.846 A:middle
labels.

00:30:45.366 --> 00:30:47.376 A:middle
So now that we know what views

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
our UI is made up of, let's go

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:52.196 A:middle
back into another demo and

00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:54.016 A:middle
actually set up this user

00:30:54.016 --> 00:30:54.586 A:middle
interface.
