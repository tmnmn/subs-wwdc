00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:01.566 A:middle
demo, I'll just hardcode this to

00:44:01.566 --> 00:44:02.366 A:middle
my own name.

00:44:02.946 --> 00:44:05.856 A:middle
Now that we've saved the score,

00:44:05.856 --> 00:44:08.356 A:middle
we need to write some code to

00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:11.236 A:middle
actually display the right

00:44:11.576 --> 00:44:13.196 A:middle
scores and the names on the

00:44:13.196 --> 00:44:13.866 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:44:14.756 --> 00:44:16.386 A:middle
So let's go ahead and create

00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:18.956 A:middle
another class by right-clicking

00:44:19.066 --> 00:44:21.506 A:middle
on the unicorn's folder and

00:44:21.506 --> 00:44:22.646 A:middle
going to new file.

00:44:23.806 --> 00:44:25.426 A:middle
A [inaudible] class again.

00:44:25.946 --> 00:44:28.836 A:middle
This will be a subclass of the

00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.466 A:middle
UI table-view-controller.

00:44:31.606 --> 00:44:33.656 A:middle
Remember when we created the

00:44:33.656 --> 00:44:35.266 A:middle
leaderboard on our storyboard?

00:44:35.616 --> 00:44:37.336 A:middle
It was a table-view-controller,

00:44:37.696 --> 00:44:40.256 A:middle
so I use a table-view-controller

00:44:40.256 --> 00:44:42.816 A:middle
class again to put in some code

00:44:42.916 --> 00:44:44.096 A:middle
for that leaderboard.

00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.626 A:middle
Let's call it the

00:44:46.626 --> 00:44:48.476 A:middle
leaderboard-view-controller.

00:44:49.796 --> 00:44:51.636 A:middle
Hit next. And create.

00:44:56.096 --> 00:44:58.106 A:middle
This already has some code that

00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:00.036 A:middle
has been generated for us by
