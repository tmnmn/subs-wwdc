00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
labels, or images.

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:03.056 A:middle
But it's not just where we

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.626 A:middle
create that one single view.

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:06.306 A:middle
It's also where we lay out all

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.786 A:middle
of the logical flow for our app

00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:08.566 A:middle
over time.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:09.416 A:middle
The story.

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:12.506 A:middle
Next we'll select the view

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:13.036 A:middle
controller.

00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:16.536 A:middle
The view controller helps us

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:17.966 A:middle
control out view, and this is

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:19.246 A:middle
where we'll write the logical

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:22.126 A:middle
code for our app.

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:23.436 A:middle
Well let's talk about how we

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.156 A:middle
create our views within our

00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:25.866 A:middle
storyboard.

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:28.536 A:middle
Let's navigate back over to the

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:29.846 A:middle
main dot-storyboard file.

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:32.006 A:middle
And at this point, make sure not

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:32.656 A:middle
to select the

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:34.276 A:middle
launchscreen.storyboard.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.586 A:middle
The launchscreen storyboard is

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.206 A:middle
what we use to create the view

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:39.296 A:middle
for when our app is being

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:40.466 A:middle
launched or loaded onto the

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:42.646 A:middle
screen the first time.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.166 A:middle
You'll notice in the upper

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.116 A:middle
right-hand corner of our

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:47.646 A:middle
storyboard here that there's an

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:48.976 A:middle
object library button.

00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:50.476 A:middle
This is a button with a circle

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:51.816 A:middle
and a little square inside.

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:53.886 A:middle
This is where we can take things

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.326 A:middle
like buttons or labels or images

00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:57.766 A:middle
and drag them onto our

00:05:57.766 --> 00:05:58.446 A:middle
storyboard.

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll
