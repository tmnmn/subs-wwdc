00:34:58.986 --> 00:35:00.856 A:middle
created between the two view

00:35:00.856 --> 00:35:01.526 A:middle
controllers.

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:04.726 A:middle
This is known as a segue.

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.946 A:middle
Now, I want to display the

00:35:07.946 --> 00:35:09.626 A:middle
details-view-controller when I

00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:11.646 A:middle
tap on the cell in the

00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:12.256 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:14.306 A:middle
So let's again hold down the

00:35:14.306 --> 00:35:16.346 A:middle
control key and drag our mouse

00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:18.556 A:middle
to the details-view-controller.

00:35:18.946 --> 00:35:21.126 A:middle
Select show one more time.

00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:24.486 A:middle
Now we are ready to run our app

00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:25.706 A:middle
for the very first time.

00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.276 A:middle
Let's look at the simulator.

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:35.356 A:middle
If I tap the leaderboard, I see

00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:37.486 A:middle
a good mock-up for my

00:35:37.486 --> 00:35:38.156 A:middle
leaderboard.

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:41.306 A:middle
I can tap on the cell and we

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:43.896 A:middle
have our details view with more

00:35:43.896 --> 00:35:44.706 A:middle
information.

00:35:45.336 --> 00:35:46.706 A:middle
This is looking good.

00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:50.306 A:middle
But how do I go back to my

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.906 A:middle
leaderboard or the game?

00:35:52.946 --> 00:35:54.756 A:middle
Let's go ahead and fix that.

00:35:56.076 --> 00:35:58.926 A:middle
To do this, I'll select the main

00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:01.036 A:middle
view controller which had the
