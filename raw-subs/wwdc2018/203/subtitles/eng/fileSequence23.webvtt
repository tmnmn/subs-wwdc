00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.106 A:middle
All in less than 30 minutes.

00:23:01.816 --> 00:23:03.676 A:middle
Now if we had more time, let's

00:23:03.676 --> 00:23:04.636 A:middle
think about some things that we

00:23:04.636 --> 00:23:05.836 A:middle
could do to take this further.

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:08.016 A:middle
Well we just used simple UI

00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:09.196 A:middle
elements like buttons and

00:23:09.196 --> 00:23:09.666 A:middle
labels.

00:23:10.076 --> 00:23:11.246 A:middle
But you could use a framework

00:23:11.246 --> 00:23:13.796 A:middle
like SpriteKit to create more

00:23:14.156 --> 00:23:15.826 A:middle
imaginative buttons that have

00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:18.036 A:middle
elements like gravity or physics

00:23:18.036 --> 00:23:19.066 A:middle
associated with them.

00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:21.476 A:middle
We could also add MusicKit

00:23:21.476 --> 00:23:23.046 A:middle
integration and have Apple music

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:24.306 A:middle
songs playing in the background

00:23:24.306 --> 00:23:25.396 A:middle
during active gameplay.

00:23:26.536 --> 00:23:28.166 A:middle
Or we could read from sensors

00:23:28.466 --> 00:23:29.736 A:middle
and change the speed of our game

00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:31.086 A:middle
based on the user's movement.

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:33.176 A:middle
Here are three talks from

00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:35.066 A:middle
previous WWDCs that I highly

00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:36.146 A:middle
recommend you check out.

00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:38.246 A:middle
Introduction to SpriteKit from

00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:39.106 A:middle
2013.

00:23:39.546 --> 00:23:41.156 A:middle
Introducing MusicKit from last

00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:41.446 A:middle
year.

00:23:41.596 --> 00:23:43.036 A:middle
And Creating Immersive Apps with

00:23:43.036 --> 00:23:44.236 A:middle
Core Motion from last year as

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:44.476 A:middle
well.

00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:46.226 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:23:46.286 --> 00:23:46.966 A:middle
I'm going to welcome [inaudible

00:23:47.006 --> 00:23:48.506 A:middle
name] on the stage to show you

00:23:48.506 --> 00:23:50.456 A:middle
how to add additional screens to

00:23:50.456 --> 00:23:50.706 A:middle
your app.

00:23:51.516 --> 00:23:57.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
