00:46:00.776 --> 00:46:03.766 A:middle
The index path argument tells us

00:46:03.856 --> 00:46:06.636 A:middle
the row number for the cell that

00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:07.576 A:middle
will be displayed.

00:46:08.856 --> 00:46:10.706 A:middle
And in here, we're expected to

00:46:10.756 --> 00:46:13.256 A:middle
configure the cell just like the

00:46:13.306 --> 00:46:14.116 A:middle
comment says.

00:46:15.526 --> 00:46:18.146 A:middle
So let me pull in some code to

00:46:18.256 --> 00:46:18.956 A:middle
set up this cell.

00:46:18.956 --> 00:46:22.126 A:middle
We are using our game data class

00:46:22.386 --> 00:46:22.876 A:middle
again.

00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:26.256 A:middle
And the index paths row will

00:46:26.256 --> 00:46:28.366 A:middle
tell us the rank of the player.

00:46:28.976 --> 00:46:30.046 A:middle
Since we want to display the

00:46:30.046 --> 00:46:31.566 A:middle
players in ascending order.

00:46:32.726 --> 00:46:35.036 A:middle
Once we have the player rank, we

00:46:35.036 --> 00:46:36.816 A:middle
can send it to the player data

00:46:36.816 --> 00:46:38.806 A:middle
method on our game data class

00:46:39.316 --> 00:46:40.996 A:middle
and get more information about

00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:41.466 A:middle
that player.

00:46:42.906 --> 00:46:45.006 A:middle
Using this information, we can

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:46.336 A:middle
set up our cell.

00:46:47.246 --> 00:46:49.626 A:middle
The text label is the title.

00:46:50.326 --> 00:46:51.956 A:middle
The detail text label is the

00:46:51.956 --> 00:46:52.826 A:middle
subtitle.

00:46:53.296 --> 00:46:54.996 A:middle
And the image view is the image

00:46:54.996 --> 00:46:56.486 A:middle
that will have the photo.

00:46:56.486 --> 00:46:59.216 A:middle
Now instead of creating this

00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:01.136 A:middle
game data instance twice, I'm
