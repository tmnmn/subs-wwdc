00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
Where should we store

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.126 A:middle
information about our users?

00:25:03.006 --> 00:25:04.466 A:middle
How do we retrieve this data?

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.006 A:middle
Second is the user interface.

00:25:08.936 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
What does the leaderboard look

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:10.626 A:middle
like?

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.056 A:middle
What use should it have?

00:25:13.666 --> 00:25:15.666 A:middle
And finally, we'll talk about

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:17.936 A:middle
the logic that's used for

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.786 A:middle
managing [inaudible] for passing

00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:21.936 A:middle
data, and for doing other tasks

00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:22.756 A:middle
within our apps.

00:25:23.826 --> 00:25:26.826 A:middle
If we break down our app into

00:25:26.826 --> 00:25:29.326 A:middle
these three categories, then we

00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:31.286 A:middle
would actually end up following

00:25:31.636 --> 00:25:33.526 A:middle
a really popular architectural

00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:35.636 A:middle
pattern known as the

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:37.046 A:middle
model-view-controller.

00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:40.596 A:middle
The model-view-controller

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:43.976 A:middle
represents the data in the

00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:44.696 A:middle
model.

00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:48.276 A:middle
The UI is represented as the

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:48.856 A:middle
view.

00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:52.286 A:middle
And the controller is the logic

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:55.056 A:middle
that communicates with both the

00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:56.606 A:middle
model and the view.

00:25:57.146 --> 00:26:00.346 A:middle
This pattern helps us group
