00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
unicorn was lonely, and they

00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:01.016 A:middle
lose.

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:04.466 A:middle
And if they successfully avoided

00:18:04.466 --> 00:18:06.126 A:middle
tapping a poop, then they get

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.966 A:middle
another round of the game.

00:18:08.456 --> 00:18:10.446 A:middle
Now we also want to say what

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:11.886 A:middle
happens if they actually do

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:13.116 A:middle
press one of the buttons during

00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:13.496 A:middle
the game.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.066 A:middle
Well if they press the unicorn

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:18.206 A:middle
button, we give them another

00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:19.436 A:middle
round of the game and give them

00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:19.876 A:middle
a point.

00:18:20.486 --> 00:18:21.806 A:middle
Otherwise, if they accidentally

00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:24.316 A:middle
select the poop, then game over.

00:18:25.366 --> 00:18:26.736 A:middle
Okay. Let's talk about what this

00:18:26.736 --> 00:18:27.496 A:middle
code looks like.

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:29.326 A:middle
We'll start off with the start

00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:29.786 A:middle
screen.

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:32.236 A:middle
Now we're going to break up our

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.656 A:middle
code into logical blocks.

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:34.786 A:middle
And in our case, we're going to

00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:36.056 A:middle
use methods to do this.

00:18:36.056 --> 00:18:37.856 A:middle
So that it's not just one long

00:18:37.856 --> 00:18:39.376 A:middle
file full of lots of code.

00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:41.096 A:middle
And it's easier for us to look

00:18:41.096 --> 00:18:42.346 A:middle
at very specific parts.

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:44.706 A:middle
The first method we're going to

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.146 A:middle
write is called start new game

00:18:46.286 --> 00:18:48.006 A:middle
which we're going to call from

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:48.676 A:middle
start pressed.

00:18:49.266 --> 00:18:50.666 A:middle
This is going to do some setup

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.846 A:middle
for the beginning of a game

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:53.766 A:middle
route.

00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:57.266 A:middle
The first thing that happens in

00:18:57.266 --> 00:18:58.726 A:middle
start new game is that we need

00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
to hide that start-game button
