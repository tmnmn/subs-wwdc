00:41:59.676 --> 00:42:01.086 A:middle
To learn more about view

00:42:01.086 --> 00:42:02.866 A:middle
controllers, check out the

00:42:02.866 --> 00:42:04.186 A:middle
documentation on

00:42:04.186 --> 00:42:05.846 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:42:07.186 --> 00:42:08.856 A:middle
We also learned about Auto

00:42:08.856 --> 00:42:10.636 A:middle
Layout which is a great

00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:12.726 A:middle
technique for building good user

00:42:12.726 --> 00:42:15.096 A:middle
interfaces for different screen

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:16.346 A:middle
sizes and different

00:42:16.346 --> 00:42:17.236 A:middle
orientations.

00:42:18.016 --> 00:42:19.586 A:middle
I would recommend checking out

00:42:19.586 --> 00:42:22.076 A:middle
these WWDC sessions to learn

00:42:22.076 --> 00:42:23.516 A:middle
more about Auto Layout.

00:42:25.146 --> 00:42:28.686 A:middle
Finally, we can hook up our data

00:42:28.876 --> 00:42:31.566 A:middle
model with our UI and write in

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:34.016 A:middle
the logic to bring everything

00:42:34.016 --> 00:42:34.546 A:middle
together.

00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:36.966 A:middle
Let's take a look at another

00:42:36.966 --> 00:42:37.446 A:middle
demo.

00:42:41.216 --> 00:42:43.526 A:middle
We need to save the score at the

00:42:43.566 --> 00:42:44.816 A:middle
end of each game.

00:42:45.736 --> 00:42:48.306 A:middle
To do this, I will select the

00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.046 A:middle
view controller that we wrote

00:42:50.046 --> 00:42:50.696 A:middle
with Jessie.

00:42:51.266 --> 00:42:54.226 A:middle
In the game over method, I will

00:42:55.396 --> 00:42:58.916 A:middle
call a method on my data model

00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.996 A:middle
that we wrote before to save the
