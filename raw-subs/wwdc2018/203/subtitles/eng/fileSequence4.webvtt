00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
sticker pack app, or even a

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:01.656 A:middle
game.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.596 A:middle
But our game is very simple, so

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:04.816 A:middle
we will just stick with single

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:05.976 A:middle
view app.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:08.886 A:middle
And then hit next.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.146 A:middle
From here we type in our app

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.216 A:middle
name, which in our case is

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.416 A:middle
Disappearing Unicorns.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.066 A:middle
And our ex-- , our team name is

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:14.926 A:middle
Example Team.

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:16.296 A:middle
And hit next.

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.875 A:middle
After we choose a place to save

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.245 A:middle
our app, we're dropped into the

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:21.255 A:middle
project settings.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:22.766 A:middle
Now we won't be making any

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.376 A:middle
changes here today, so we'll go

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:25.336 A:middle
ahead and look at the other

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:26.736 A:middle
important files in our Project

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:28.436 A:middle
Navigator on the left-hand side.

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:30.186 A:middle
The first one is the

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:30.896 A:middle
AppDelegate.

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:34.156 A:middle
An AppDelegate is created for

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:35.856 A:middle
each app, and it helps us manage

00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:37.196 A:middle
the lifecycle of our app over

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:37.416 A:middle
time.

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:39.626 A:middle
There's certain methods that can

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:40.936 A:middle
be called when we're going into

00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:42.236 A:middle
the background or coming into

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:42.866 A:middle
the foreground.

00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:44.586 A:middle
But we won't be making any

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:45.756 A:middle
changes with our AppDelegate

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:46.416 A:middle
today either.

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:49.966 A:middle
Next I'm going to select the

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.356 A:middle
main storyboard file.

00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:53.746 A:middle
The storyboard is where we

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:55.336 A:middle
create the UI or the user

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.116 A:middle
interface for our app.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.006 A:middle
And where we can add all of the

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.806 A:middle
UI elements like buttons,

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
labels, or images.
