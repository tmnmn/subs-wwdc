00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.566 A:middle
Oh, nice! Okay, so when I press

00:17:00.566 --> 00:17:02.196 A:middle
this start-game button, I should

00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:04.406 A:middle
see that the start-game button

00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:05.566 A:middle
was pressed is logged in my

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.366 A:middle
console down here.

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:09.036 A:middle
Awesome! We've just created a

00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:10.476 A:middle
UI, and we've connected it to

00:17:10.476 --> 00:17:10.925 A:middle
our code.

00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:13.465 A:middle
Let's jump back over and start

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.296 A:middle
talking about the game logic for

00:17:15.296 --> 00:17:15.536 A:middle
our app.

00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
Okay, so in the very beginning

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:21.506 A:middle
of our game, we know we have

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:23.316 A:middle
that start screen, and it has

00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:24.695 A:middle
two buttons on it.

00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:25.986 A:middle
It has that start-game button

00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:27.215 A:middle
and that leaderboard button.

00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:28.756 A:middle
But we're just talking about the

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:29.696 A:middle
gameplay right now.

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.436 A:middle
So we're going to wait for the

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:34.236 A:middle
start-game button pressed.

00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.536 A:middle
And once that button is pressed,

00:17:35.806 --> 00:17:37.236 A:middle
we drop into playing mode.

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:39.266 A:middle
And at the beginning of playing

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:41.796 A:middle
mode, we get a random emoji in a

00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:43.386 A:middle
random location on the screen.

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:45.216 A:middle
Either a unicorn or a poop.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.096 A:middle
At that point, we set a timer

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:50.396 A:middle
for one second to allow our user

00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:52.176 A:middle
to have time to interact with

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:52.746 A:middle
our button.

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.476 A:middle
Now at the end of that one

00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:57.376 A:middle
second, if the user did not

00:17:57.626 --> 00:17:59.196 A:middle
press a unicorn, then the

00:17:59.196 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
unicorn was lonely, and they
