00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:01.206 A:middle
Oh no. My labels are all

00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:03.746 A:middle
clipped, and my image is too far

00:38:03.746 --> 00:38:04.266 A:middle
to the left.

00:38:04.956 --> 00:38:07.256 A:middle
In order to make my layout look

00:38:07.256 --> 00:38:08.976 A:middle
right-- let's put that back.

00:38:10.076 --> 00:38:12.196 A:middle
I'll use a technique known as

00:38:12.316 --> 00:38:13.066 A:middle
Auto Layout.

00:38:14.616 --> 00:38:16.536 A:middle
Auto Layout is a set of rules

00:38:16.776 --> 00:38:19.706 A:middle
that we define to tell our app

00:38:19.706 --> 00:38:21.846 A:middle
how we want our views to be

00:38:21.896 --> 00:38:22.216 A:middle
placed.

00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:26.846 A:middle
So each rule in Auto Layout is

00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:28.366 A:middle
known as a constraint.

00:38:29.386 --> 00:38:31.336 A:middle
Now we'll add some constraints

00:38:31.856 --> 00:38:33.316 A:middle
to this image view in our

00:38:33.316 --> 00:38:34.696 A:middle
details-view-controller.

00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:37.606 A:middle
Look at the buttons at the

00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:40.156 A:middle
bottom right of the storyboard.

00:38:41.356 --> 00:38:43.506 A:middle
We'll click on the align button,

00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:45.756 A:middle
the one with two horizontal bars

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.356 A:middle
and say horizontally in

00:38:48.386 --> 00:38:48.876 A:middle
container.

00:38:48.876 --> 00:38:51.026 A:middle
Add one constraint.

00:38:51.026 --> 00:38:54.346 A:middle
This tells our app that we want

00:38:54.346 --> 00:38:56.546 A:middle
our image view to always be in

00:38:56.546 --> 00:38:57.926 A:middle
the horizontal center.

00:38:58.656 --> 00:39:01.146 A:middle
I'll also click on the button to
