00:37:01.146 --> 00:37:03.036 A:middle
And go to the app icon image

00:37:03.156 --> 00:37:03.366 A:middle
set.

00:37:04.836 --> 00:37:06.956 A:middle
Now I have some icons that my

00:37:06.956 --> 00:37:08.016 A:middle
designer created.

00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:11.446 A:middle
I'll select these and drop them

00:37:11.546 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
into Xcode.

00:37:14.656 --> 00:37:16.756 A:middle
There's a specific way in which

00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:18.436 A:middle
you need to create these icons.

00:37:18.686 --> 00:37:20.116 A:middle
And we have guidelines on

00:37:20.116 --> 00:37:21.766 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:25.676 A:middle
This time when we run our app,

00:37:26.116 --> 00:37:28.296 A:middle
I'll close this-- we will see an

00:37:28.296 --> 00:37:30.976 A:middle
icon on the home screen.

00:37:31.646 --> 00:37:32.406 A:middle
Isn't it cute?

00:37:33.516 --> 00:37:36.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:36.596 --> 00:37:36.856 A:middle
Thank you.

00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:39.166 A:middle
Let's go back into the app.

00:37:40.586 --> 00:37:42.126 A:middle
And tap on the leaderboard.

00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:45.936 A:middle
This time we're able to go back

00:37:45.936 --> 00:37:47.826 A:middle
and forth between all our views.

00:37:47.826 --> 00:37:49.386 A:middle
This is great!

00:37:50.356 --> 00:37:50.926 A:middle
Let's now-

00:37:51.016 --> 00:37:52.286 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:52.286 --> 00:37:53.546 A:middle
I'm glad you like that.

00:37:54.656 --> 00:37:56.686 A:middle
Let's now rotate our phone and

00:37:56.746 --> 00:37:57.726 A:middle
see what happens.

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:01.206 A:middle
Oh no. My labels are all
