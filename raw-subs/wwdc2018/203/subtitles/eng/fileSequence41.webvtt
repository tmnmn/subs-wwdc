00:40:59.586 --> 00:41:00.636 A:middle
screen for our game.

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.406 A:middle
We learned that we can create

00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:05.846 A:middle
multiple view controllers to

00:41:05.846 --> 00:41:07.716 A:middle
display multiple screens of

00:41:07.776 --> 00:41:08.426 A:middle
content.

00:41:09.016 --> 00:41:11.846 A:middle
If we do create multiple screens

00:41:11.846 --> 00:41:16.016 A:middle
of content, then we need to tell

00:41:16.506 --> 00:41:18.596 A:middle
iOS how to go from one view

00:41:18.596 --> 00:41:19.946 A:middle
controller to another.

00:41:20.976 --> 00:41:23.486 A:middle
We do this by adding connections

00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:25.506 A:middle
that are known as segues.

00:41:27.296 --> 00:41:28.046 A:middle
We created a

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.506 A:middle
table-view-controller which is

00:41:30.006 --> 00:41:32.316 A:middle
great for displaying lists of

00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:32.596 A:middle
data.

00:41:34.186 --> 00:41:36.236 A:middle
We also added it inside a

00:41:36.236 --> 00:41:37.696 A:middle
navigation controller.

00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:40.776 A:middle
The navigation controller helped

00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:42.636 A:middle
us go back and forth between the

00:41:42.636 --> 00:41:45.826 A:middle
table view and the details page.

00:41:46.966 --> 00:41:49.386 A:middle
This pattern of using a table

00:41:49.386 --> 00:41:51.016 A:middle
view along with the navigation

00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:53.286 A:middle
controller is commonly seen

00:41:53.396 --> 00:41:54.586 A:middle
across iOS apps.

00:41:55.756 --> 00:41:56.966 A:middle
Here are just some examples.

00:41:59.676 --> 00:42:01.086 A:middle
