00:50:58.466 --> 00:51:00.946 A:middle
It will be called for us as soon

00:51:00.946 --> 00:51:03.346 A:middle
as we tap on a cell in our

00:51:03.346 --> 00:51:04.506 A:middle
table-view-controller.

00:51:05.226 --> 00:51:08.296 A:middle
So in here, I will get more

00:51:08.336 --> 00:51:10.216 A:middle
information about the player

00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:11.786 A:middle
based on the rank again.

00:51:11.786 --> 00:51:14.206 A:middle
And I can figure out the rank

00:51:14.616 --> 00:51:16.866 A:middle
because there is a property on

00:51:16.866 --> 00:51:18.816 A:middle
the table view called index path

00:51:19.196 --> 00:51:20.256 A:middle
for selected row.

00:51:20.256 --> 00:51:23.456 A:middle
This tells me the row number for

00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:24.946 A:middle
the cell that was selected.

00:51:25.476 --> 00:51:29.036 A:middle
We also get a segue parameter in

00:51:29.036 --> 00:51:29.566 A:middle
this method.

00:51:29.566 --> 00:51:32.706 A:middle
Remember how segues connect two

00:51:32.706 --> 00:51:33.686 A:middle
view controllers?

00:51:33.776 --> 00:51:36.286 A:middle
So the segue's destination

00:51:36.286 --> 00:51:38.686 A:middle
property will tell me which view

00:51:38.686 --> 00:51:40.146 A:middle
controller we're navigating

00:51:40.146 --> 00:51:40.666 A:middle
towards.

00:51:41.956 --> 00:51:44.236 A:middle
Once we have an instance of the

00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:46.456 A:middle
details-view-controller which is

00:51:46.456 --> 00:51:47.686 A:middle
the one we're going towards,

00:51:48.286 --> 00:51:50.496 A:middle
then we can set the player info

00:51:50.786 --> 00:51:52.206 A:middle
with the details we have.

00:51:53.776 --> 00:51:55.686 A:middle
Finally, we are ready to run our

00:51:55.686 --> 00:51:58.426 A:middle
app one last time and see how

00:51:58.426 --> 00:51:59.686 A:middle
everything comes together.
