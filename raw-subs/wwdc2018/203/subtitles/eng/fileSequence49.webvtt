00:48:58.286 --> 00:49:00.446 A:middle
code that we'll import into our

00:49:00.446 --> 00:49:01.156 A:middle
project.

00:49:03.336 --> 00:49:03.936 A:middle
This is the

00:49:03.936 --> 00:49:06.586 A:middle
details-view-controller class.

00:49:07.116 --> 00:49:09.056 A:middle
Let's jump to it from our jump

00:49:09.166 --> 00:49:09.466 A:middle
bar.

00:49:11.226 --> 00:49:14.326 A:middle
Here we have some IBOutlets for

00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:15.746 A:middle
the different views in our

00:49:15.746 --> 00:49:17.126 A:middle
details-view-controller.

00:49:18.196 --> 00:49:20.506 A:middle
Remember when we wrote the game,

00:49:20.506 --> 00:49:22.526 A:middle
we connected these IBOutlets to

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:24.236 A:middle
the views on the storyboard.

00:49:25.226 --> 00:49:26.526 A:middle
But we're not able to do that

00:49:26.616 --> 00:49:27.196 A:middle
right now.

00:49:28.026 --> 00:49:30.376 A:middle
This is because we haven't told

00:49:30.436 --> 00:49:32.526 A:middle
Xcode that the code for this

00:49:32.526 --> 00:49:34.196 A:middle
view controller is right here.

00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:36.636 A:middle
Let's do that again by going to

00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:38.466 A:middle
the Identity Inspector and

00:49:38.466 --> 00:49:39.936 A:middle
changing the class name to

00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:41.246 A:middle
details-view-controller.

00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:44.806 A:middle
Now we can connect the IBOutlets

00:49:44.896 --> 00:49:45.476 A:middle
easily.

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:55.166 A:middle
By doing this, we can set the

00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:57.506 A:middle
views from our code like I've

00:49:57.506 --> 00:49:59.946 A:middle
done in the view load method

00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:00.226 A:middle
here.
