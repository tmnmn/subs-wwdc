00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:01.896 A:middle
And in this case, I don't need

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.306 A:middle
my storyboard up anymore.

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.586 A:middle
I'm just going to be making

00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:05.816 A:middle
changes to my view controller.

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:07.676 A:middle
So I can select here the

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:10.146 A:middle
standard editor, and then select

00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:11.156 A:middle
my view controller from my

00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:12.156 A:middle
Project Navigator.

00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:15.046 A:middle
Now, we've already written our

00:21:15.126 --> 00:21:17.266 A:middle
code in our slides.

00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:19.086 A:middle
So I'm going to just quickly add

00:21:19.086 --> 00:21:21.206 A:middle
it into our view controller

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:22.216 A:middle
using some shortcuts.

00:21:22.506 --> 00:21:24.856 A:middle
So here we have start new game

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:26.716 A:middle
where we hide our start game and

00:21:26.716 --> 00:21:27.906 A:middle
our leaderboard button.

00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:29.506 A:middle
Set up some initial stuff with

00:21:29.506 --> 00:21:31.546 A:middle
our game points, and then call

00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:32.546 A:middle
one round of our game.

00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:35.906 A:middle
Then we need our one-game round.

00:21:36.506 --> 00:21:39.386 A:middle
And here we update our points

00:21:39.386 --> 00:21:41.646 A:middle
label, display random button,

00:21:41.646 --> 00:21:42.576 A:middle
and call our timer.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:45.996 A:middle
And finally we need to put the

00:21:45.996 --> 00:21:47.766 A:middle
code and for the logic in our

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.766 A:middle
both our start pressed.

00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:52.196 A:middle
And our good pressed.

00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:57.886 A:middle
And finally our bad pressed.

00:21:58.036 --> 00:21:59.966 A:middle
Okay. We have all the code we

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:00.256 A:middle
need.
