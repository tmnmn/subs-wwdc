00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:01.136 A:middle
game data instance twice, I'm

00:47:01.136 --> 00:47:02.406 A:middle
just going to put it at the top

00:47:02.406 --> 00:47:04.036 A:middle
of the class so it can be

00:47:04.036 --> 00:47:04.556 A:middle
reused.

00:47:06.136 --> 00:47:08.136 A:middle
Let me also delete the number of

00:47:08.236 --> 00:47:09.976 A:middle
sections method that was added

00:47:09.976 --> 00:47:11.936 A:middle
for us by default, because we

00:47:11.936 --> 00:47:12.936 A:middle
don't need this today.

00:47:13.506 --> 00:47:15.576 A:middle
Now that we have written the

00:47:15.656 --> 00:47:17.996 A:middle
code for the leaderboard, let's

00:47:18.076 --> 00:47:20.546 A:middle
open the main storyboard and the

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:21.986 A:middle
Assistant Editor on the right.

00:47:23.546 --> 00:47:25.486 A:middle
I'll rotate the specs so we can

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.646 A:middle
see it properly.

00:47:30.476 --> 00:47:33.116 A:middle
We need to tell Xcode that the

00:47:33.256 --> 00:47:35.786 A:middle
code for our leaderboard here is

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.616 A:middle
written in the class that we

00:47:37.616 --> 00:47:38.426 A:middle
just created.

00:47:39.466 --> 00:47:41.786 A:middle
To do this, I'll select the view

00:47:41.786 --> 00:47:43.516 A:middle
controller for the leaderboard.

00:47:44.466 --> 00:47:46.616 A:middle
Go to the Identity Inspector,

00:47:47.306 --> 00:47:49.386 A:middle
and change the class name to

00:47:49.386 --> 00:47:50.806 A:middle
leaderboard-view-controller.

00:47:51.346 --> 00:47:54.216 A:middle
After this, I'll select the

00:47:54.316 --> 00:47:57.366 A:middle
table view in the storyboard.

00:47:58.066 --> 00:48:00.146 A:middle
Go to the attributes Inspector
