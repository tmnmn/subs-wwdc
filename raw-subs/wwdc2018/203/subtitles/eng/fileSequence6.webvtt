00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.346 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:03.186 A:middle
see the outline view for our

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:04.026 A:middle
app.

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:05.916 A:middle
And if you click the little

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
disclosure triangle, you'll see

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:08.336 A:middle
all the different things that

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.836 A:middle
are currently on our storyboard.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.346 A:middle
Now you're thinking to yourself,

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:12.366 A:middle
"There's nothing on this

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:12.896 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:13.736 A:middle
Why is this helpful?"

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:15.546 A:middle
Well, in the future, you may

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.836 A:middle
have lots of elements on your

00:06:16.836 --> 00:06:17.436 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.106 A:middle
And eventually you may not be

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.176 A:middle
able to find something because

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:21.256 A:middle
it could be under something

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:21.466 A:middle
else.

00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:22.456 A:middle
Or maybe you've accidentally

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:23.356 A:middle
created duplicates.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:24.846 A:middle
So this is a great place to go

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:25.816 A:middle
if you're looking for all of the

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:26.776 A:middle
elements that you've put on your

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:27.356 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:30.306 A:middle
Alright. Let's go ahead and jump

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.756 A:middle
into our demo and start making

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:31.976 A:middle
our app.

00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:35.796 A:middle
So here I'm going to go over to

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.426 A:middle
my computer where I already have

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:39.136 A:middle
Xcode launched.

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:41.796 A:middle
Okay. And I have my Disappearing

00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:43.896 A:middle
Unicorns file.

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.496 A:middle
Here I'm navigating to the main

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:46.286 A:middle
storyboard.

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:47.746 A:middle
And let's go ahead and start off

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:48.946 A:middle
by adding all of those UI

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:50.376 A:middle
elements that we need to create

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:50.776 A:middle
our game.

00:06:51.396 --> 00:06:52.436 A:middle
So I'm going to go up to the

00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:53.506 A:middle
object library.

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:55.276 A:middle
And I can scroll through here

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:56.486 A:middle
and see all of the different

00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:57.636 A:middle
things that I can put on there.

00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:01.136 A:middle
We have labels, buttons, text
