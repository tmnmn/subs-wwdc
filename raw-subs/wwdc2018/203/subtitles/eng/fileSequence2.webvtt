00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
And we were after having this

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:02.516 A:middle
experience countless times of

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:03.336 A:middle
waiting in line.

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:04.956 A:middle
We decided that we needed to

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.016 A:middle
make something to keep ourselves

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:07.116 A:middle
occupied while we wait.

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:08.966 A:middle
So we decided to make a game.

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:11.106 A:middle
Something quick and fun to keep

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:12.326 A:middle
us occupied for a short amount

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:12.806 A:middle
of time.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:14.726 A:middle
And I said, "Well, of course if

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:15.876 A:middle
we make a game, it has to have

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:16.526 A:middle
unicorns."

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
But then we needed something

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.006 A:middle
that people would want to avoid.

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:21.726 A:middle
Maybe poop.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.296 A:middle
And so we decided to make a

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:26.636 A:middle
whack-a-mole-type game with

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:27.836 A:middle
unicorn and poop.

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.966 A:middle
And then incorporate scores and

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.586 A:middle
eventually a leaderboard to keep

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:32.896 A:middle
track of our scores over time.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:33.976 A:middle
Because we have a little bit of

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:34.916 A:middle
a competitive nature.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.816 A:middle
So let's take a look at what

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:39.086 A:middle
this game play looks like.

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:42.006 A:middle
Upon pressing start game, a

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:43.496 A:middle
random emoji's going to appear

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:44.676 A:middle
somewhere randomly on the

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:45.006 A:middle
screen.

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.896 A:middle
Either a unicorn or a poop.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:49.556 A:middle
At that point, the user has one

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:51.086 A:middle
second to click that button.

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:54.286 A:middle
Now, if they hit the unicorn,

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:55.876 A:middle
then they get one point.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.446 A:middle
Then if they accidentally tap

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:59.416 A:middle
the poop, then the game is over.
