00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:00.336 A:middle
rotate it, we should be able to

00:40:00.446 --> 00:40:02.976 A:middle
see our view laid out properly.

00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:05.936 A:middle
There's an even easier way to

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.166 A:middle
validate our layout.

00:40:08.136 --> 00:40:09.516 A:middle
We can go to the Device

00:40:09.606 --> 00:40:11.786 A:middle
Configuration pane at the bottom

00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:13.126 A:middle
left of the storyboard.

00:40:14.466 --> 00:40:16.526 A:middle
And change the orientation here

00:40:16.676 --> 00:40:18.066 A:middle
to landscape.

00:40:18.796 --> 00:40:21.836 A:middle
Now I can see my view in the

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:23.276 A:middle
landscape orientation.

00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:25.436 A:middle
And my image is looking, my

00:40:25.436 --> 00:40:27.796 A:middle
image is in the center, and my

00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:30.436 A:middle
labels are all seen on the same

00:40:30.436 --> 00:40:30.976 A:middle
page.

00:40:32.436 --> 00:40:34.086 A:middle
You could even change the device

00:40:34.126 --> 00:40:36.056 A:middle
from the Device Configuration

00:40:36.056 --> 00:40:38.476 A:middle
pane to see how this would look

00:40:38.716 --> 00:40:40.966 A:middle
on an iPad or a smaller phone.

00:40:41.506 --> 00:40:46.486 A:middle
With that, a UI is all set up.

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:48.866 A:middle
Let's quickly recap what we

00:40:48.866 --> 00:40:50.336 A:middle
learned in this session,

00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:51.056 A:middle
section.

00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:55.006 A:middle
We started with a

00:40:55.006 --> 00:40:57.596 A:middle
single-view-controller which had

00:40:57.816 --> 00:40:59.426 A:middle
the-- which managed the entire

00:40:59.586 --> 00:41:00.636 A:middle
screen for our game.
