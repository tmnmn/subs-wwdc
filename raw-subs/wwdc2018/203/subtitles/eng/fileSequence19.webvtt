00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
to hide that start-game button

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:01.336 A:middle
and hide that leaderboard

00:19:01.336 --> 00:19:01.746 A:middle
button.

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.206 A:middle
Then we need to update our

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:05.726 A:middle
points label and set it to zero.

00:19:06.366 --> 00:19:07.706 A:middle
And we can even do some cool

00:19:07.706 --> 00:19:09.576 A:middle
things here like dynamically

00:19:09.576 --> 00:19:11.666 A:middle
change the color of our points

00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:13.016 A:middle
label throughout our code.

00:19:13.226 --> 00:19:14.576 A:middle
And here I'm going to set that

00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:15.996 A:middle
text color to magenta during

00:19:16.046 --> 00:19:16.706 A:middle
active gameplay.

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.406 A:middle
Finally at the end of setting up

00:19:19.406 --> 00:19:21.486 A:middle
my start new game, I'm going to

00:19:21.486 --> 00:19:23.196 A:middle
call the first round of my game.

00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:27.326 A:middle
Okay? Let's look at that.

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.196 A:middle
In our one-game round, we first

00:19:29.196 --> 00:19:30.706 A:middle
update our points label, make

00:19:30.706 --> 00:19:31.626 A:middle
sure that it's up to date.

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:34.116 A:middle
Then we display a random button.

00:19:34.116 --> 00:19:35.586 A:middle
Either that unicorn or that poop

00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:37.396 A:middle
in a random location on our

00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:37.816 A:middle
screen.

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:39.716 A:middle
I've written this helper method

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:41.046 A:middle
display random button that

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.376 A:middle
chooses a random x and y

00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:44.276 A:middle
coordinate to place our button.

00:19:45.406 --> 00:19:47.156 A:middle
Then we set a timer for one

00:19:47.156 --> 00:19:47.606 A:middle
second.

00:19:48.726 --> 00:19:51.026 A:middle
Now, if this timer goes off

00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:53.216 A:middle
after one second, then the code

00:19:53.216 --> 00:19:54.596 A:middle
inside the block of the timer

00:19:54.596 --> 00:19:55.306 A:middle
will get called.

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:58.226 A:middle
And in that case, we want to

00:19:58.226 --> 00:19:59.676 A:middle
check if the current button

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.486 A:middle
that's on screen is a unicorn,
