00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.866 A:middle
One of them is this method

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.826 A:middle
called set up fresh game state.

00:15:03.476 --> 00:15:05.946 A:middle
You'll notice that it makes sure

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:06.666 A:middle
that the start game and

00:15:06.666 --> 00:15:08.556 A:middle
leaderboard button are unhidden.

00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:09.346 A:middle
They're onscreen.

00:15:10.006 --> 00:15:11.946 A:middle
It hides my gameplay buttons,

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:13.876 A:middle
and it sets up some initial

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.666 A:middle
values for my points.

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:19.036 A:middle
So here in my viewDidLoad, I

00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:21.116 A:middle
also want to call up set up

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:23.196 A:middle
fresh game state.

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.126 A:middle
You'll notice here as I'm

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:27.756 A:middle
typing, Xcode is autocompleting

00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:29.016 A:middle
all of the things that I could

00:15:29.016 --> 00:15:31.046 A:middle
possibly put as some code.

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:33.236 A:middle
In this case, if I hit enter

00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:34.646 A:middle
with set up fresh game state

00:15:34.916 --> 00:15:36.276 A:middle
already highlighted, it'll

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:39.306 A:middle
automatically populate it for

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:39.543 A:middle
me.

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:41.606 A:middle
Okay. One last thing we want to

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.526 A:middle
do, and then we can build and

00:15:42.526 --> 00:15:43.066 A:middle
run our app.

00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:46.396 A:middle
Just for sanity, in my start

00:15:46.396 --> 00:15:48.366 A:middle
pressed method, action method,

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:49.376 A:middle
I'm going to put a print

00:15:49.446 --> 00:15:50.356 A:middle
statement here.

00:15:51.176 --> 00:15:53.496 A:middle
And say start game button was

00:15:53.496 --> 00:15:53.686 A:middle
pressed.

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:56.706 A:middle
And I expect that every time I

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
press that start-game button,

00:15:58.426 --> 00:15:59.746 A:middle
this line of code will be logged

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:00.466 A:middle
to my console.
