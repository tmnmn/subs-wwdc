00:27:00.066 --> 00:27:02.426 A:middle
is what most iOS classes are.

00:27:03.486 --> 00:27:05.906 A:middle
I'll click next, and I'll pull

00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:07.646 A:middle
my [inaudible] class data.

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:11.966 A:middle
This will be a subclass of

00:27:11.966 --> 00:27:14.236 A:middle
NSobject which is a good parent

00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:15.406 A:middle
class for my data.

00:27:16.526 --> 00:27:19.086 A:middle
Let's hit next and create.

00:27:19.796 --> 00:27:23.636 A:middle
In this class, we want to store

00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:25.336 A:middle
information about the player.

00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:28.236 A:middle
So let me use a shortcut to add

00:27:28.526 --> 00:27:29.926 A:middle
some code I wrote before.

00:27:30.556 --> 00:27:33.916 A:middle
We have variables to store the

00:27:33.916 --> 00:27:36.836 A:middle
name, points, rank, and image

00:27:37.126 --> 00:27:38.006 A:middle
for each person.

00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:41.596 A:middle
In addition to this, I've added

00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:43.626 A:middle
some initializers to set up this

00:27:43.656 --> 00:27:43.906 A:middle
data.

00:27:44.716 --> 00:27:46.026 A:middle
But we don't need to worry about

00:27:46.026 --> 00:27:46.406 A:middle
those.

00:27:47.626 --> 00:27:49.496 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add one more

00:27:49.496 --> 00:27:51.626 A:middle
class by right-clicking on the

00:27:51.626 --> 00:27:53.586 A:middle
folder again and going to add

00:27:53.946 --> 00:27:54.366 A:middle
files.

00:27:55.046 --> 00:27:58.216 A:middle
This is the game data class that

00:27:58.216 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
I've written already.
