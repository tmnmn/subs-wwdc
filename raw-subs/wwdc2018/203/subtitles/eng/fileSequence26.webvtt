00:25:57.146 --> 00:26:00.346 A:middle
This pattern helps us group

00:26:00.346 --> 00:26:01.666 A:middle
together similar tasks.

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.706 A:middle
And it makes it easy for us to

00:26:04.706 --> 00:26:06.976 A:middle
make changes to one part of our

00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:08.656 A:middle
app without impacting the

00:26:08.656 --> 00:26:09.126 A:middle
others.

00:26:10.636 --> 00:26:14.286 A:middle
In iOS, the controller can be

00:26:14.286 --> 00:26:16.676 A:middle
represented as a subclass of the

00:26:16.676 --> 00:26:18.086 A:middle
UI-view-controller class.

00:26:19.816 --> 00:26:22.656 A:middle
The view can be a subclass of

00:26:22.656 --> 00:26:23.766 A:middle
the UI view class.

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:29.326 A:middle
And the model can be a subclass

00:26:29.866 --> 00:26:30.936 A:middle
of NSobject.

00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:33.026 A:middle
When we build our app today, we

00:26:33.356 --> 00:26:35.236 A:middle
will take a closer look at the

00:26:35.376 --> 00:26:36.786 A:middle
different parts of the

00:26:36.786 --> 00:26:38.006 A:middle
model-view-controller.

00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:41.196 A:middle
Let's now jump into a demo and

00:26:41.656 --> 00:26:43.876 A:middle
build a model to store our data.

00:26:46.206 --> 00:26:48.206 A:middle
Here's the Disappearing Unicorns

00:26:48.276 --> 00:26:49.506 A:middle
project that we made with

00:26:49.506 --> 00:26:49.976 A:middle
Jessie.

00:26:51.396 --> 00:26:52.906 A:middle
Let me right click on the

00:26:52.906 --> 00:26:55.426 A:middle
Disappearing Unicorns folder and

00:26:55.426 --> 00:26:56.376 A:middle
say new file.

00:26:57.846 --> 00:26:59.186 A:middle
Select [inaudible] class which
