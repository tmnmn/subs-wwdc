&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:09.306 A:middle
I hope you've enjoyed building

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:10.466 A:middle
the game with poops and

00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:11.126 A:middle
unicorns.

00:24:12.706 --> 00:24:13.886 A:middle
My name is [inaudible name] and

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.856 A:middle
I'm here to help you add some

00:24:16.986 --> 00:24:18.786 A:middle
awesome features to your apps.

00:24:20.006 --> 00:24:22.156 A:middle
Along the way we'll learn about

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:24.816 A:middle
APIs and frameworks that are

00:24:24.816 --> 00:24:26.766 A:middle
commonly used across iOS.

00:24:28.456 --> 00:24:30.536 A:middle
First, let's take a look at the

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:32.476 A:middle
features we want to add to our

00:24:32.476 --> 00:24:32.946 A:middle
game.

00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:35.986 A:middle
We would like to introduce a

00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:38.306 A:middle
leaderboard where we can see

00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:40.376 A:middle
names and the points for each

00:24:40.376 --> 00:24:42.206 A:middle
person who's played our game.

00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:46.206 A:middle
When we tap on a name, we want

00:24:46.206 --> 00:24:48.236 A:middle
to see more information about

00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.006 A:middle
that person.

00:24:49.536 --> 00:24:53.646 A:middle
As we build our app today, we'll

00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:55.626 A:middle
focus on three main areas.

00:24:56.906 --> 00:24:58.416 A:middle
One is the data.

00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
Where should we store
