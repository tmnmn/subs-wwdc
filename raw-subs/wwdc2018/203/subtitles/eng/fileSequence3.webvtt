But in addition to this, if they

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:03.076 A:middle
miss the unicorn, the

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:05.276 A:middle
not-so-lonely unicorn, and so

00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:06.556 A:middle
they automatically lose the

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:06.856 A:middle
game.

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.706 A:middle
So the goal is hit all the

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:09.316 A:middle
unicorns.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.116 A:middle
Don't hit the poops.

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:12.356 A:middle
Let's take a look at this.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.356 A:middle
Get it! Nice!

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:19.516 A:middle
Get that unicorn.

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:23.346 A:middle
Oh! There we go, one more.

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:24.426 A:middle
Oh! Oh, shoot.

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:25.686 A:middle
Moving too quickly and

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:27.736 A:middle
accidentally hit a poop.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:29.276 A:middle
Let's jump right in.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:32.016 A:middle
So for those of you who aren't

00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:34.256 A:middle
familiar, Xcode is a tool we use

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:35.916 A:middle
on macOS to help build iOS,

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:38.666 A:middle
macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:41.276 A:middle
You can download it from the App

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:42.086 A:middle
Store if you don't have it

00:03:42.086 --> 00:03:42.576 A:middle
already.

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.206 A:middle
So when we open up Xcode, we

00:03:45.206 --> 00:03:46.736 A:middle
first want to select create a

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:47.826 A:middle
new Xcode project.

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:51.126 A:middle
After this, we see all the

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:52.556 A:middle
different type of app templates

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:53.316 A:middle
that we can create.

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:55.076 A:middle
In our case, we're going to

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:56.126 A:middle
select single view app.

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:57.736 A:middle
But notice here that you could

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.706 A:middle
also select a page based app, a

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:01.196 A:middle
sticker pack app, or even a
