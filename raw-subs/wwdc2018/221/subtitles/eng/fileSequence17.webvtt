00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
So this will allow the bounds of

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:02.466 A:middle
our text view to resize to fit

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.296 A:middle
the text.

00:17:05.455 --> 00:17:07.465 A:middle
Last but not least, this white

00:17:07.496 --> 00:17:09.056 A:middle
background really needs to go,

00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:10.826 A:middle
so we're going to set it to

00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:11.506 A:middle
transparent.

00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:13.886 A:middle
Now Interface Builder made it

00:17:13.886 --> 00:17:15.205 A:middle
really easy to customize this

00:17:15.246 --> 00:17:16.695 A:middle
text view but just like our

00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:18.596 A:middle
labels before, we can set all

00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:19.076 A:middle
this in code.

00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:21.586 A:middle
So here in Swift, we can set the

00:17:21.586 --> 00:17:23.036 A:middle
text and the formatting

00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:24.606 A:middle
properties dynamically at

00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:24.906 A:middle
runtime.

00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:27.506 A:middle
So we looked at Apple News to

00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:28.546 A:middle
pick the right control, but now

00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:30.196 A:middle
we're going to look at a

00:17:30.196 --> 00:17:32.096 A:middle
different app that we're all

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:33.216 A:middle
familiar with to choose the

00:17:33.216 --> 00:17:36.036 A:middle
right configuration and that's

00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:36.786 A:middle
TextEdit.

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:39.476 A:middle
Now TextEdit is an app on macOS

00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:42.136 A:middle
that handles display and editing

00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:43.406 A:middle
of rich text content.

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:46.156 A:middle
Now what most people don't know

00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:48.396 A:middle
is that TextEdit is actually a

00:17:48.396 --> 00:17:49.656 A:middle
really thin wrapper around

00:17:49.876 --> 00:17:50.526 A:middle
NSTextView.

00:17:51.826 --> 00:17:52.906 A:middle
So I want to take a moment to

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.646 A:middle
marvel at just how much we get

00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:56.436 A:middle
for free with TextKit.

00:17:57.006 --> 00:17:59.156 A:middle
So this is the inspector bar,

00:17:59.526 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
and we get this for free just by
