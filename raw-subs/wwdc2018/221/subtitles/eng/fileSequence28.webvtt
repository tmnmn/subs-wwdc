00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:01.006 A:middle
initializer with no attribute

00:28:01.006 --> 00:28:01.516 A:middle
information.

00:28:01.516 --> 00:28:04.046 A:middle
And when you create a new

00:28:04.046 --> 00:28:05.646 A:middle
attributed string and you don't

00:28:05.646 --> 00:28:06.526 A:middle
provide any attribute

00:28:06.526 --> 00:28:08.626 A:middle
information, that new attributed

00:28:08.626 --> 00:28:09.826 A:middle
string, we use the default

00:28:09.826 --> 00:28:10.226 A:middle
attributes.

00:28:11.026 --> 00:28:11.926 A:middle
And the default font is

00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:13.136 A:middle
Helvetica 12 point.

00:28:13.686 --> 00:28:15.876 A:middle
And so to recap what happened,

00:28:16.166 --> 00:28:17.366 A:middle
we started with this original

00:28:17.366 --> 00:28:19.036 A:middle
attributed string with the font

00:28:19.036 --> 00:28:20.566 A:middle
Comic Sans 24 applied to the

00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:21.356 A:middle
entire range.

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:24.986 A:middle
And then we created this new

00:28:24.986 --> 00:28:26.416 A:middle
attributed string, and it got

00:28:26.416 --> 00:28:27.506 A:middle
initialized with the default

00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:27.966 A:middle
attributes.

00:28:28.856 --> 00:28:30.156 A:middle
And we applied our bold font to

00:28:30.156 --> 00:28:31.226 A:middle
the word don't on this new

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:33.016 A:middle
string, and we ended up with

00:28:33.016 --> 00:28:34.896 A:middle
this incorrect result here where

00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:36.296 A:middle
the word don't is in Comic Sans

00:28:36.296 --> 00:28:37.886 A:middle
bold 24, and the rest of the

00:28:37.886 --> 00:28:39.366 A:middle
string is in the default font of

00:28:39.366 --> 00:28:40.146 A:middle
Helvetica 12.

00:28:40.726 --> 00:28:43.916 A:middle
And so there are two different

00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:44.776 A:middle
ways that we could do this

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:46.826 A:middle
correctly and one way is to

00:28:46.826 --> 00:28:47.916 A:middle
avoid mixing the plain and

00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:49.086 A:middle
attributed text altogether.

00:28:50.146 --> 00:28:51.416 A:middle
So by initializing our new

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:52.446 A:middle
attributed string using the

00:28:52.446 --> 00:28:53.676 A:middle
original one, we're going to

00:28:53.676 --> 00:28:54.816 A:middle
keep those original attributes.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:56.326 A:middle
And then we can apply our new

00:28:56.326 --> 00:28:57.606 A:middle
attributes without getting this

00:28:57.606 --> 00:28:58.976 A:middle
reset effect with the default

00:28:58.976 --> 00:28:59.176 A:middle
ones.

00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:02.466 A:middle
But it's not always feasible to
