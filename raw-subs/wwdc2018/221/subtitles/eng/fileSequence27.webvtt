00:27:00.716 --> 00:27:02.366 A:middle
Now here we have our original

00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:02.746 A:middle
font.

00:27:03.386 --> 00:27:05.326 A:middle
And we're going to use a font

00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:06.796 A:middle
descriptor to create a bold

00:27:06.796 --> 00:27:08.376 A:middle
version of this original font.

00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:11.796 A:middle
Then, we're going to initialize

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.196 A:middle
our mutable attributed string

00:27:13.526 --> 00:27:14.526 A:middle
using the original text.

00:27:14.526 --> 00:27:16.866 A:middle
We're going to apply our new

00:27:16.866 --> 00:27:18.876 A:middle
font or new bold font to the

00:27:18.876 --> 00:27:20.586 A:middle
word don't and that's going to

00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:21.496 A:middle
be the first five characters.

00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:22.986 A:middle
And then we're going to set the

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:24.386 A:middle
attributed text property of our

00:27:24.386 --> 00:27:25.996 A:middle
UITextView to use this new

00:27:25.996 --> 00:27:28.566 A:middle
attributed string except when we

00:27:28.606 --> 00:27:30.096 A:middle
do that we'll see that our new

00:27:30.096 --> 00:27:32.186 A:middle
bold font applied to the word

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:34.416 A:middle
don't just as we expected but

00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:35.676 A:middle
the rest of the string somehow

00:27:35.676 --> 00:27:36.986 A:middle
lost the original font.

00:27:37.506 --> 00:27:39.696 A:middle
And now those of you who despise

00:27:39.696 --> 00:27:40.966 A:middle
Comic Sans might be happy about

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:43.676 A:middle
that, but the result is wrong

00:27:43.806 --> 00:27:45.296 A:middle
and so that warrants a sad face.

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.926 A:middle
So why did this happen?

00:27:48.506 --> 00:27:51.046 A:middle
And to answer that, let's take a

00:27:51.046 --> 00:27:52.196 A:middle
closer look at how we're

00:27:52.196 --> 00:27:53.476 A:middle
initializing our attributed

00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:53.856 A:middle
string.

00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:56.806 A:middle
So notice that we're using a

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.526 A:middle
plain text string to initialize

00:27:58.526 --> 00:27:59.616 A:middle
it, and we're using the

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:01.006 A:middle
initializer with no attribute
