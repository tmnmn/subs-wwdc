00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.096 A:middle
And so if you have more text

00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:03.696 A:middle
than that or if you need these

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:04.546 A:middle
selection or scrolling

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:05.966 A:middle
capabilities then you should use

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.676 A:middle
a UITextView with editing

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:08.116 A:middle
disabled.

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.286 A:middle
Now going back to the top.

00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:12.456 A:middle
If you do need text input, then

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:13.626 A:middle
consider whether you need secure

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.186 A:middle
text entry.

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:15.336 A:middle
And this would be like a

00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:16.936 A:middle
password field where the text is

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.206 A:middle
obscured and copying is

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:18.666 A:middle
disabled.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.806 A:middle
And so if you need that, then

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:23.726 A:middle
use UITextField because this is

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.076 A:middle
the only control that supports

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.026 A:middle
secure text entry.

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:29.346 A:middle
Otherwise, think about how much

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:30.886 A:middle
text you expect to be entered.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:33.016 A:middle
And if you want something that's

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:34.466 A:middle
like a form field input that

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:36.076 A:middle
only needs a line, then use

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:36.836 A:middle
UITextField.

00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:38.686 A:middle
And UITextField only supports

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.716 A:middle
one line of text entry.

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:42.996 A:middle
Otherwise, if you need more than

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:44.556 A:middle
that, you can use UITextView.

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:47.976 A:middle
And so now here's that same

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:49.206 A:middle
decision process for AppKit.

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:51.006 A:middle
And it's similar to the UIKit

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:52.286 A:middle
process but there's a few small

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:52.656 A:middle
differences.

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.496 A:middle
So, again, you're going to start

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:56.456 A:middle
by considering whether you need

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:57.036 A:middle
text input.

00:03:57.596 --> 00:04:00.196 A:middle
And AppKit doesn't have a label
