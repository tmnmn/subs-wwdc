00:17:59.526 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
and we get this for free just by

00:18:00.986 --> 00:18:02.456 A:middle
checking a checkbox in Interface

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:02.796 A:middle
Builder.

00:18:03.396 --> 00:18:04.716 A:middle
And right below it is a ruler

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:06.456 A:middle
view which we also get for free

00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:09.006 A:middle
just by enabling it.

00:18:09.006 --> 00:18:10.116 A:middle
And everything below that is

00:18:10.206 --> 00:18:12.996 A:middle
just a text view.

00:18:13.206 --> 00:18:15.296 A:middle
Actually, it's a text view, text

00:18:15.296 --> 00:18:17.346 A:middle
container, layout manager, and

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.066 A:middle
text storage.

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:19.756 A:middle
Now this is the standard

00:18:19.756 --> 00:18:21.216 A:middle
configuration for both

00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:24.966 A:middle
NSTextView and UITextView, but

00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:26.746 A:middle
the similarities mostly stop

00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:27.056 A:middle
there.

00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:30.556 A:middle
So, for example, tables are only

00:18:30.556 --> 00:18:31.896 A:middle
supported in NSTextView.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.386 A:middle
And marveling again at the power

00:18:34.636 --> 00:18:36.336 A:middle
that we get for free, TextKit

00:18:36.336 --> 00:18:37.576 A:middle
provides a table editor that

00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:38.746 A:middle
does all the heavy lifting for

00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:39.646 A:middle
us.

00:18:42.476 --> 00:18:44.026 A:middle
Now when we use TextEdit, we're

00:18:44.026 --> 00:18:45.336 A:middle
often editing large amounts of

00:18:45.336 --> 00:18:45.596 A:middle
text.

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:48.026 A:middle
Sometimes we paste in a lot of

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.446 A:middle
lorem ipsum to see that we also

00:18:49.446 --> 00:18:50.666 A:middle
get a spell-checker for free.

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.776 A:middle
But really what we want to see

00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:54.126 A:middle
is that when we use the format

00:18:54.126 --> 00:18:55.976 A:middle
menu to choose wrap to page, we

00:18:56.466 --> 00:18:58.706 A:middle
end up with it looking a little

00:18:58.706 --> 00:18:59.626 A:middle
bit more like a page.

00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:00.716 A:middle
We can see that the text
