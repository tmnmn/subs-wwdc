00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:01.086 A:middle
technologies or understand the

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.566 A:middle
intricacies of complex scripts.

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:04.356 A:middle
And there are a lot of things

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.706 A:middle
you get for free too like all of

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:06.736 A:middle
these display features that you

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:07.146 A:middle
see here.

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:10.346 A:middle
And for editing, you'll also get

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:11.636 A:middle
access to all the tech services

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:12.646 A:middle
that are supported by the OS

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.466 A:middle
like accessibility, spell

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:15.186 A:middle
checking and more.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:16.946 A:middle
And you can take advantage of

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:18.276 A:middle
all of these great features

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:19.566 A:middle
without having to write a single

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.086 A:middle
line of code and that's pretty

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:21.486 A:middle
awesome.

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:23.716 A:middle
And so with all of this

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:24.406 A:middle
functionality at your

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:25.986 A:middle
fingertips, how do you decide

00:02:25.986 --> 00:02:27.646 A:middle
which control to use?

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:29.246 A:middle
So let's talk about that,

00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:30.796 A:middle
choosing the right control for

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:31.636 A:middle
your situation.

00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:32.956 A:middle
And the options are going to be

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:33.926 A:middle
a little bit different depending

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:35.676 A:middle
on whether you're using UIKit or

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:36.046 A:middle
AppKit.

00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:37.506 A:middle
So let's review them separately.

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:38.166 A:middle
All right.

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:40.466 A:middle
Let's start with UIKit.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.296 A:middle
And first you're going to

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.456 A:middle
consider whether you need text

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:44.846 A:middle
input.

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:47.476 A:middle
And if you don't need text

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:49.006 A:middle
input, then consider whether you

00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:50.406 A:middle
need selection or scrolling.

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.376 A:middle
And if you don't need these,

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:54.916 A:middle
then you should use UILabel.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.276 A:middle
UILabels are intended for small

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:58.936 A:middle
amounts of text like a few words

00:02:58.936 --> 00:02:59.656 A:middle
or a few lines.
