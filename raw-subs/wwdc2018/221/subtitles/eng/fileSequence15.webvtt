00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:00.066 A:middle
wanted to use just one label, we

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
wouldn't be able to do this in

00:15:01.486 --> 00:15:02.356 A:middle
Interface Builder.

00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:06.156 A:middle
So how could we do this?

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:07.646 A:middle
Well, we can take advantage of

00:15:07.646 --> 00:15:09.216 A:middle
the power and flexibility of

00:15:09.216 --> 00:15:10.056 A:middle
attributed strings.

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:13.556 A:middle
Now an attributed string is a

00:15:13.556 --> 00:15:15.026 A:middle
run of characters that can have

00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:16.796 A:middle
attributes applied to ranges of

00:15:16.796 --> 00:15:17.236 A:middle
characters.

00:15:18.076 --> 00:15:19.246 A:middle
Now some attributes you get for

00:15:19.246 --> 00:15:21.506 A:middle
free like the default font and

00:15:21.506 --> 00:15:23.766 A:middle
text color, but we can override

00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:24.796 A:middle
these attributes with our own

00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:25.156 A:middle
values.

00:15:25.956 --> 00:15:27.216 A:middle
In this case, we're going to set

00:15:27.216 --> 00:15:28.426 A:middle
part of our string's text color

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:28.756 A:middle
to white.

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:32.796 A:middle
Now to see attributed string in

00:15:32.926 --> 00:15:34.386 A:middle
action, we'll use the add

00:15:34.556 --> 00:15:35.646 A:middle
attribute method on

00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:37.606 A:middle
NSMutableAttributedString to set

00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:39.376 A:middle
the text color to white just for

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:40.266 A:middle
the range that we want.

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:42.816 A:middle
And this time we'll set the

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:44.476 A:middle
attributed text property on our

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:44.796 A:middle
label.

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:49.586 A:middle
At runtime, this looks pretty

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:50.246 A:middle
spiffy.

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:53.516 A:middle
Now UILabels were a great choice

00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:55.846 A:middle
for this sort of text.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:56.876 A:middle
Now if we look at the bottom of

00:15:56.876 --> 00:15:57.846 A:middle
the screen, we'll see a

00:15:57.966 --> 00:15:58.366 A:middle
headline.

00:15:58.546 --> 00:15:59.666 A:middle
Now this is also text, but it's

00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:01.516 A:middle
a little bit bigger and it spans
