00:33:59.486 --> 00:34:00.526 A:middle
there have been incidents in the

00:34:00.526 --> 00:34:02.456 A:middle
recent past where some people on

00:34:02.456 --> 00:34:04.446 A:middle
the Internet have exploited bugs

00:34:04.446 --> 00:34:05.746 A:middle
in our software to cause

00:34:05.816 --> 00:34:06.976 A:middle
problems for people who use our

00:34:07.016 --> 00:34:07.346 A:middle
products.

00:34:08.896 --> 00:34:10.016 A:middle
And in response, we're

00:34:10.016 --> 00:34:11.416 A:middle
continuing to devise techniques

00:34:11.606 --> 00:34:12.956 A:middle
for mitigating these kinds of

00:34:12.956 --> 00:34:16.036 A:middle
attacks, but today I'd like to

00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:17.326 A:middle
talk about how we can work

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:18.755 A:middle
together to provide a stronger

00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:20.025 A:middle
defense against these attacks.

00:34:20.815 --> 00:34:21.626 A:middle
So you may have heard of the

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:24.126 A:middle
concept defense in depth.

00:34:24.706 --> 00:34:26.056 A:middle
And in case you're not familiar

00:34:26.056 --> 00:34:27.856 A:middle
with the terms, defense in depth

00:34:27.856 --> 00:34:29.085 A:middle
refers to creating multiple

00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:30.706 A:middle
layers of protection to defend

00:34:30.706 --> 00:34:31.226 A:middle
against threats.

00:34:31.226 --> 00:34:33.315 A:middle
And this concept has been around

00:34:33.315 --> 00:34:33.926 A:middle
for centuries.

00:34:34.096 --> 00:34:35.556 A:middle
You can see it in the design of

00:34:35.556 --> 00:34:36.275 A:middle
medieval castles.

00:34:36.826 --> 00:34:38.056 A:middle
The land around the outside is

00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:39.266 A:middle
clear of trees so you can see

00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:39.906 A:middle
attackers coming.

00:34:39.906 --> 00:34:41.656 A:middle
And there's a moat to make

00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:42.525 A:middle
approaching the castle more

00:34:42.525 --> 00:34:43.545 A:middle
difficult and to prevent

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:44.306 A:middle
tunneling underneath it.

00:34:44.306 --> 00:34:46.505 A:middle
And the walls are another

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:46.876 A:middle
defense.

00:34:47.076 --> 00:34:48.166 A:middle
They're built tall so that

00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.096 A:middle
they're difficult to climb.

00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:50.926 A:middle
And there are arrow slits in the

00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:52.456 A:middle
walls and crenellations at the

00:34:52.456 --> 00:34:54.255 A:middle
top to allow defenders to fire

00:34:54.255 --> 00:34:55.406 A:middle
on attackers from protected

00:34:55.406 --> 00:34:55.886 A:middle
locations.

00:34:57.096 --> 00:34:58.796 A:middle
Now any one of these individual

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.176 A:middle
protections might not be enough
