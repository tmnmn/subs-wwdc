00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:01.516 A:middle
a little bit bigger and it spans

00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:02.216 A:middle
multiple lines.

00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:05.956 A:middle
Another thing that makes this

00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:06.976 A:middle
text different is that it's

00:16:06.976 --> 00:16:07.616 A:middle
selectable.

00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:10.676 A:middle
So which control should we use

00:16:10.676 --> 00:16:11.166 A:middle
this time?

00:16:12.376 --> 00:16:14.076 A:middle
Now both text field and text

00:16:14.076 --> 00:16:16.246 A:middle
view support selection but text

00:16:16.246 --> 00:16:18.206 A:middle
field is meant for usually just

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:18.706 A:middle
one line.

00:16:19.306 --> 00:16:21.596 A:middle
So in this case, since our

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:22.716 A:middle
headline can span multiple

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.206 A:middle
lines, we're going to use a text

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:26.496 A:middle
view.

00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:28.126 A:middle
Now when we put a text view onto

00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:29.596 A:middle
our storyboard, we can see that

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:31.046 A:middle
we get a lot of lorem ipsum text

00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:31.706 A:middle
by default.

00:16:32.606 --> 00:16:33.456 A:middle
So we're going to go ahead and

00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:35.286 A:middle
change the text in the inspector

00:16:35.366 --> 00:16:35.626 A:middle
panel.

00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:38.096 A:middle
We're also going to change the

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:39.396 A:middle
font to look a little bit more

00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:40.166 A:middle
like Apple News.

00:16:40.806 --> 00:16:43.276 A:middle
And we want to disable the

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:44.316 A:middle
editing feature because the

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:45.646 A:middle
headline isn't really editable.

00:16:46.246 --> 00:16:49.386 A:middle
Now UITextView scroll by default

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.336 A:middle
because they are a subclass of

00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:52.136 A:middle
UIScrollView.

00:16:53.156 --> 00:16:54.746 A:middle
But if we want our text view to

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:57.046 A:middle
play well with auto layout, we

00:16:57.046 --> 00:16:58.126 A:middle
want to disable scrolling.

00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
So this will allow the bounds of
