00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.056 A:middle
Comic Sans because it's been

00:30:01.056 --> 00:30:02.136 A:middle
totally eliminated from the

00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:03.976 A:middle
string but it's wrong.

00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:05.446 A:middle
And it's wrong in a different

00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:06.276 A:middle
way from last time.

00:30:06.826 --> 00:30:08.586 A:middle
And to understand the

00:30:08.586 --> 00:30:09.796 A:middle
difference, let's recall that

00:30:09.796 --> 00:30:11.686 A:middle
attribute fixing happens before

00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:13.296 A:middle
layout and this is where the

00:30:13.296 --> 00:30:14.736 A:middle
system repairs the inconsistent

00:30:14.736 --> 00:30:15.236 A:middle
attributes.

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:17.196 A:middle
And so here in our attributed

00:30:17.286 --> 00:30:18.546 A:middle
string we have a single

00:30:18.546 --> 00:30:19.906 A:middle
paragraph with multiple

00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:21.736 A:middle
paragraph styles and that's

00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:22.646 A:middle
pretty inconsistent.

00:30:23.496 --> 00:30:24.996 A:middle
So when the system fixes the

00:30:24.996 --> 00:30:26.426 A:middle
attributes of this string, it's

00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:27.086 A:middle
going to take the first

00:30:27.086 --> 00:30:28.976 A:middle
paragraph style it finds and

00:30:28.976 --> 00:30:29.706 A:middle
apply it to the entire

00:30:29.706 --> 00:30:30.206 A:middle
paragraph.

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:32.296 A:middle
And that's how we ended up with

00:30:32.296 --> 00:30:34.096 A:middle
our attributed string displaying

00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:35.046 A:middle
with the default paragraph

00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:35.386 A:middle
style.

00:30:35.946 --> 00:30:38.486 A:middle
And the key take away here is to

00:30:38.486 --> 00:30:39.906 A:middle
be explicit with your

00:30:39.906 --> 00:30:41.416 A:middle
attributes, especially when

00:30:41.416 --> 00:30:42.216 A:middle
you're mixing plain and

00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:42.926 A:middle
attributed text.

00:30:43.836 --> 00:30:44.916 A:middle
So by doing this, you're going

00:30:44.916 --> 00:30:46.346 A:middle
to avoid this reset effect with

00:30:46.346 --> 00:30:47.216 A:middle
the default attributes.

00:30:47.826 --> 00:30:49.406 A:middle
And for AppKit developers, this

00:30:49.406 --> 00:30:51.126 A:middle
is actually super important if

00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:52.176 A:middle
you're updating your app for

00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:52.696 A:middle
dark mode.

00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:54.526 A:middle
So by using the explicit

00:30:54.526 --> 00:30:56.056 A:middle
attributes with the dynamic

00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:57.886 A:middle
colors like NSColor.textColor,

00:30:57.946 --> 00:30:59.216 A:middle
you'll ensure that your text is

00:30:59.216 --> 00:31:00.146 A:middle
drawn with the correct colors
