be enabled.

00:33:01.266 --> 00:33:02.776 A:middle
And this is because when you

00:33:02.776 --> 00:33:04.366 A:middle
disable scrolling, asking for

00:33:04.366 --> 00:33:06.086 A:middle
the intrinsic content size of

00:33:06.086 --> 00:33:07.116 A:middle
your text view is going to

00:33:07.116 --> 00:33:08.376 A:middle
require laying out all the text

00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:09.776 A:middle
and then you wouldn't get the

00:33:09.776 --> 00:33:10.716 A:middle
performance benefits of

00:33:10.716 --> 00:33:11.726 A:middle
noncontinuous layout in the

00:33:11.726 --> 00:33:12.156 A:middle
first place.

00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:15.636 A:middle
And that brings me to a really

00:33:15.636 --> 00:33:16.376 A:middle
important point.

00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:18.236 A:middle
You should avoid requesting

00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:19.696 A:middle
layout for all or most of the

00:33:19.696 --> 00:33:20.916 A:middle
text at once when you're using

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:23.136 A:middle
noncontinuous layout since that

00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:24.116 A:middle
kind of defeats the purpose of

00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.026 A:middle
using it in the first place.

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.516 A:middle
So if you have only one text

00:33:27.516 --> 00:33:28.926 A:middle
container, don't ask for the

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:29.956 A:middle
layout of the entire thing.

00:33:30.796 --> 00:33:31.866 A:middle
And don't ask for layout for

00:33:31.866 --> 00:33:33.196 A:middle
large ranges of characters or

00:33:33.196 --> 00:33:34.256 A:middle
glyphs that include the end of

00:33:35.116 --> 00:33:37.106 A:middle
the text.

00:33:37.366 --> 00:33:38.526 A:middle
And we didn't dig too deeply

00:33:38.526 --> 00:33:39.406 A:middle
into the topic of text

00:33:39.406 --> 00:33:40.806 A:middle
performance here because I gave

00:33:40.806 --> 00:33:42.076 A:middle
a great talk on this last year

00:33:42.386 --> 00:33:44.826 A:middle
at WWDC 2017, Efficient

00:33:44.826 --> 00:33:45.766 A:middle
unteractions with Frameworks.

00:33:46.186 --> 00:33:47.226 A:middle
And you can access the video

00:33:47.226 --> 00:33:48.576 A:middle
from that more information link

00:33:48.576 --> 00:33:49.306 A:middle
at the end of the session.

00:33:49.306 --> 00:33:50.026 A:middle
All right.

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:53.876 A:middle
Now it's time to talk about

00:33:53.876 --> 00:33:55.006 A:middle
everyone's favorite topic,

00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:55.666 A:middle
security.

00:33:56.406 --> 00:33:59.486 A:middle
So you may have noticed that

00:33:59.486 --> 00:34:00.526 A:middle
there have been incidents in the
