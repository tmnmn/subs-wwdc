00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:00.916 A:middle
input is potentially untrusted.

00:36:02.086 --> 00:36:03.926 A:middle
When you allow text input, you

00:36:03.926 --> 00:36:05.906 A:middle
allow copy and paste.

00:36:05.906 --> 00:36:08.206 A:middle
You don't know what kind of text

00:36:08.206 --> 00:36:08.986 A:middle
can be pasted in there.

00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:10.926 A:middle
It could be anything.

00:36:10.926 --> 00:36:12.016 A:middle
It could be a string with

00:36:12.016 --> 00:36:12.766 A:middle
malicious character

00:36:12.766 --> 00:36:14.436 A:middle
combinations, or it could just

00:36:14.436 --> 00:36:15.816 A:middle
be a string that's really,

00:36:16.126 --> 00:36:19.236 A:middle
really, really long.

00:36:20.566 --> 00:36:21.796 A:middle
And even though long strings

00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:23.116 A:middle
like that may not be malicious

00:36:23.116 --> 00:36:24.336 A:middle
in themselves, it could cause

00:36:24.336 --> 00:36:25.526 A:middle
your app to freeze or hang.

00:36:26.296 --> 00:36:27.386 A:middle
So if you have a text field

00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:29.276 A:middle
that's intended for one line of

00:36:29.276 --> 00:36:30.816 A:middle
input and someone pastes the

00:36:30.816 --> 00:36:32.126 A:middle
entire contents of "War and

00:36:32.126 --> 00:36:33.536 A:middle
Peace" into it, which is about

00:36:33.856 --> 00:36:35.106 A:middle
3.1 million characters in

00:36:35.106 --> 00:36:37.576 A:middle
English, is that reasonable?

00:36:39.636 --> 00:36:41.226 A:middle
Probably not.

00:36:42.316 --> 00:36:43.916 A:middle
So this is a great example of a

00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:45.106 A:middle
case where it makes sense to

00:36:45.106 --> 00:36:46.656 A:middle
impose your own limits.

00:36:47.926 --> 00:36:49.376 A:middle
And here are the recommended

00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:50.316 A:middle
approaches for setting these

00:36:50.316 --> 00:36:50.926 A:middle
kinds of limits.

00:36:51.766 --> 00:36:52.856 A:middle
You want to validate the input

00:36:52.926 --> 00:36:54.236 A:middle
string before it's set on the

00:36:54.236 --> 00:36:54.756 A:middle
text field.

00:36:55.186 --> 00:36:56.846 A:middle
And so for UITextFields, you can

00:36:56.846 --> 00:36:57.706 A:middle
do this by using

00:36:57.986 --> 00:36:59.066 A:middle
UITextFieldDelegate.

00:36:59.936 --> 00:37:01.356 A:middle
And for NSTextFields, you should
