00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:00.446 A:middle
ton of customization options in

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:01.256 A:middle
the inspector panel.

00:14:01.846 --> 00:14:03.756 A:middle
So we're going to go ahead and

00:14:03.756 --> 00:14:05.076 A:middle
change the text to spotlight.

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:07.776 A:middle
We're going to change the font

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:09.336 A:middle
to use the body style.

00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:12.616 A:middle
And we're going to enable

00:14:12.616 --> 00:14:14.546 A:middle
dynamic type, which allows those

00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:15.866 A:middle
with accessibility settings

00:14:15.866 --> 00:14:17.956 A:middle
enabled to see text in a font

00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:19.236 A:middle
size and style that is

00:14:19.236 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
appropriate for their needs.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.266 A:middle
Now it's great that we can

00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:24.216 A:middle
customize this label in

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:25.966 A:middle
Interface Builder, but we can

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:27.196 A:middle
also see all these properties in

00:14:27.276 --> 00:14:27.596 A:middle
Swift.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.616 A:middle
So we can set the text and the

00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:31.626 A:middle
formatting properties

00:14:31.846 --> 00:14:33.036 A:middle
dynamically at runtime.

00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:36.266 A:middle
Now back in Interface Builder,

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:38.276 A:middle
we'll go ahead and add two more

00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:38.646 A:middle
labels.

00:14:40.206 --> 00:14:41.536 A:middle
Now everything fits pretty well,

00:14:42.146 --> 00:14:44.146 A:middle
but we have one more thing we

00:14:44.146 --> 00:14:44.786 A:middle
need to do here.

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:47.586 A:middle
So looking back at Apple News,

00:14:47.716 --> 00:14:48.876 A:middle
we can see that the text on the

00:14:48.876 --> 00:14:50.246 A:middle
right is actually displayed with

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:51.416 A:middle
two different colors.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.226 A:middle
Part of it's black and part of

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:53.676 A:middle
it's white.

00:14:55.006 --> 00:14:56.016 A:middle
Now we could achieve this with

00:14:56.016 --> 00:14:57.876 A:middle
two separate labels, but if we

00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:00.066 A:middle
wanted to use just one label, we
