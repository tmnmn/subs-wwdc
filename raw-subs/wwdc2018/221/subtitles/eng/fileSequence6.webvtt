00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.706 A:middle
So now you know what you can do

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
with TextKit just by using the

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:04.796 A:middle
built-in controls.

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:06.686 A:middle
But if you want to go beyond

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:07.716 A:middle
what these controls provide,

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:08.986 A:middle
you'll need to find the right

00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:10.336 A:middle
customization point within the

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:11.276 A:middle
text stack.

00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:14.036 A:middle
And like much of Cocoa, TextKit

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:15.496 A:middle
is based on the model view

00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:16.766 A:middle
controller design pattern.

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:19.356 A:middle
And the text system can be

00:06:19.356 --> 00:06:20.946 A:middle
divided into three phases that

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:22.256 A:middle
correspond it directly to NBC

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:24.676 A:middle
and that's storage, display, and

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:25.236 A:middle
layout.

00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:27.446 A:middle
And so now let's take a closer

00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:28.916 A:middle
look at the TextKit objects that

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:29.946 A:middle
make up each of these phases.

00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:32.176 A:middle
And we'll start with the storage

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.746 A:middle
which corresponds to the model.

00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:36.866 A:middle
Now NSTextStorage holds your

00:06:36.866 --> 00:06:38.026 A:middle
string data and your attributes.

00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.166 A:middle
It's a subclass of mutable

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.806 A:middle
attributed string and so you can

00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:43.146 A:middle
work with it in the same way

00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:44.046 A:middle
that you already know how to

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:45.046 A:middle
work with attributed strings.

00:06:46.036 --> 00:06:47.256 A:middle
And my colleague Emily will show

00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:48.666 A:middle
you some really powerful ways to

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:49.896 A:middle
customize the text storage a

00:06:49.896 --> 00:06:51.246 A:middle
little bit later so stay tuned

00:06:51.246 --> 00:06:52.146 A:middle
for that.

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:55.716 A:middle
Now NSTextContainer models the

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:56.906 A:middle
geometry of the area where your

00:06:56.906 --> 00:06:57.866 A:middle
text will be laid out.

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.006 A:middle
And by default, it's a rectangle
