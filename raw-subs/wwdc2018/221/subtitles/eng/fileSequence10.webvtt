00:09:58.796 --> 00:10:00.336 A:middle
the right configuration of these

00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:01.826 A:middle
components to create different

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:02.876 A:middle
effects.

00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:04.806 A:middle
So this is your standard

00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:05.466 A:middle
configuration.

00:10:05.466 --> 00:10:07.666 A:middle
And when you drag and drop a

00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:08.816 A:middle
text view from Interface

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:10.116 A:middle
Builder, you'll automatically

00:10:10.116 --> 00:10:11.896 A:middle
get one of each component as

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:12.306 A:middle
shown here.

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:14.416 A:middle
And most the time this is all

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:17.286 A:middle
you're going to need.

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:19.046 A:middle
If you want a multiple page or a

00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:20.776 A:middle
multiple column layout, you can

00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:22.426 A:middle
use pairs of text containers and

00:10:22.426 --> 00:10:24.076 A:middle
text views, one pair for each

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:24.756 A:middle
page or column.

00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:26.856 A:middle
And you can hook all of these up

00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:28.166 A:middle
to the same layout manager in

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:29.526 A:middle
the same text storage so that

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:30.866 A:middle
they share the layout

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:31.856 A:middle
information in the backing

00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:32.166 A:middle
store.

00:10:32.746 --> 00:10:35.016 A:middle
And if you want different

00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:36.156 A:middle
layouts in each of you, you can

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:37.906 A:middle
do that too, just use multiple

00:10:37.906 --> 00:10:38.576 A:middle
layout managers.

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:40.416 A:middle
And, again, since the text

00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:41.726 A:middle
shares the same backing store,

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:43.626 A:middle
updating that text will update

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:44.186 A:middle
all of the views.

00:10:44.886 --> 00:10:47.796 A:middle
Now we didn't go into too much

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:48.636 A:middle
detail about these

00:10:48.636 --> 00:10:49.986 A:middle
configurations because there's a

00:10:49.986 --> 00:10:50.926 A:middle
great past session that's

00:10:50.926 --> 00:10:52.496 A:middle
already done that so check out

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:54.686 A:middle
WWDC 2010 session Advanced Cocoa

00:10:54.686 --> 00:10:55.996 A:middle
Text Tips and Tricks.

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:57.836 A:middle
And this will be accessible from

00:10:57.836 --> 00:10:59.006 A:middle
that more information link at

00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:02.476 A:middle
the end of the session.
