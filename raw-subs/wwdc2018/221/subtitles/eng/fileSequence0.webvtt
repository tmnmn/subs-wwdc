&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.336 A:middle
Welcome to session 221, TextKit

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:29.906 A:middle
Best Practices.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:31.086 A:middle
I'm Donna Tom.

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:32.826 A:middle
And I'm the TextKit engineer.

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:35.076 A:middle
And my colleague Emily Van Haren

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.116 A:middle
from authoring tools will be

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:36.806 A:middle
joining me today.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.796 A:middle
And we're both really excited to

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:39.756 A:middle
share with you some best

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:40.866 A:middle
practices for working with

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.286 A:middle
TextKit.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:42.746 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.786 A:middle
First, we're going to review

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:47.086 A:middle
some key concepts for working

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:47.616 A:middle
with TextKit.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.916 A:middle
Then, we'll dive into some

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.316 A:middle
examples to illustrate how to

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:52.596 A:middle
apply the key concepts in your

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:52.663 A:middle
app.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:55.316 A:middle
And finally, we'll wrap up with

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:56.716 A:middle
some best practices in the areas

00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:58.706 A:middle
of correctness, performance, and

00:00:58.706 --> 00:00:59.116 A:middle
security.
