00:31:59.946 --> 00:32:01.626 A:middle
luckily, we can avoid this

00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:03.616 A:middle
situation by using noncontinuous

00:32:03.616 --> 00:32:03.916 A:middle
layout.

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.896 A:middle
And so as the name implies, with

00:32:06.896 --> 00:32:08.286 A:middle
noncontinuous layout, the layout

00:32:08.286 --> 00:32:10.216 A:middle
manager doesn't have to do glyph

00:32:10.216 --> 00:32:11.656 A:middle
generation and layout in order

00:32:11.716 --> 00:32:12.896 A:middle
from the beginning of the text

00:32:12.896 --> 00:32:13.296 A:middle
storage.

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:15.626 A:middle
So now when that person, using

00:32:15.626 --> 00:32:16.756 A:middle
your app, scrolls to the middle

00:32:17.026 --> 00:32:18.956 A:middle
of your text view, the layout

00:32:18.956 --> 00:32:20.016 A:middle
manager can perform glyph

00:32:20.016 --> 00:32:21.106 A:middle
generation and layout for that

00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:22.696 A:middle
middle section right away.

00:32:23.346 --> 00:32:25.696 A:middle
So if your text storage has a

00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:26.886 A:middle
lot of text in it, using

00:32:26.886 --> 00:32:28.376 A:middle
noncontinuous layout is a huge

00:32:28.376 --> 00:32:29.276 A:middle
performance win.

00:32:29.776 --> 00:32:32.476 A:middle
Great. So how do you turn this

00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:33.366 A:middle
on?

00:32:33.836 --> 00:32:35.946 A:middle
Well, noncontinuous layout is a

00:32:35.946 --> 00:32:37.366 A:middle
property of NSLayoutManager.

00:32:37.366 --> 00:32:39.346 A:middle
And so for NSTextView, you can

00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:41.346 A:middle
access the text to use layout

00:32:41.346 --> 00:32:42.486 A:middle
manager and then you can set

00:32:42.486 --> 00:32:43.436 A:middle
that property there.

00:32:44.006 --> 00:32:46.896 A:middle
For UITextView, you usually

00:32:46.896 --> 00:32:47.786 A:middle
don't have to do anything

00:32:47.786 --> 00:32:48.756 A:middle
because this is turned on by

00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:50.846 A:middle
default, but there's just one

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:51.946 A:middle
important thing to remember.

00:32:53.006 --> 00:32:54.926 A:middle
Since UITextView is a subclass

00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:57.806 A:middle
of UIScrollView, noncontinuous

00:32:57.846 --> 00:32:59.586 A:middle
layout will require scrolling to

00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:00.106 A:middle
be enabled.
