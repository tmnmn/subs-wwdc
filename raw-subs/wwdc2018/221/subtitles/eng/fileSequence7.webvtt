00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.006 A:middle
And by default, it's a rectangle

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:01.596 A:middle
but you can customize the flow

00:07:01.596 --> 00:07:02.746 A:middle
or the shape of the text layout

00:07:02.876 --> 00:07:03.486 A:middle
as shown here.

00:07:04.096 --> 00:07:06.186 A:middle
And for more detailed

00:07:06.186 --> 00:07:07.216 A:middle
information on working with the

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:08.806 A:middle
storage objects, check out these

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:10.606 A:middle
great past WWDC sessions and

00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:11.246 A:middle
documentation.

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:12.656 A:middle
And they'll be available from

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:13.896 A:middle
the more information link at the

00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:16.596 A:middle
end of the session.

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:18.676 A:middle
And next up is the display phase

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:21.156 A:middle
and that corresponds to the

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:21.276 A:middle
view.

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:22.626 A:middle
And we've already talked about

00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:23.746 A:middle
the display phase quite a bit

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:24.736 A:middle
when we talked about choosing

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:25.396 A:middle
the right control.

00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:26.436 A:middle
And so for additional

00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:27.876 A:middle
information, you can again check

00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:28.816 A:middle
out these documentation

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:29.186 A:middle
resources.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:30.796 A:middle
And they'll also be accessible

00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:31.986 A:middle
from that more information link

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:35.166 A:middle
at the end of the session.

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:36.586 A:middle
And finally, we have the layout

00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:37.956 A:middle
phase which corresponds to the

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:38.446 A:middle
controller.

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:41.836 A:middle
And NSLayoutManager is the only

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:42.656 A:middle
component in this phase.

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:44.396 A:middle
And let me tell you it is a

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:44.806 A:middle
beast.

00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:47.386 A:middle
And I mean that in a good way

00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:49.256 A:middle
because it's so awesome at what

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:49.656 A:middle
it does.

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:51.316 A:middle
So it's the brains of the whole

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.056 A:middle
operation.

00:07:52.056 --> 00:07:53.296 A:middle
It coordinates changes between

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:54.616 A:middle
all of the phases, and it

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:55.776 A:middle
controls the layout process

00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:55.996 A:middle
itself.

00:07:56.066 --> 00:07:59.296 A:middle
So here's a quick overview of

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.546 A:middle
how that layout process works.
