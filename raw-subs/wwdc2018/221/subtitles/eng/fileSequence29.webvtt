00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:02.466 A:middle
But it's not always feasible to

00:29:02.466 --> 00:29:03.746 A:middle
just avoid mixing plain and

00:29:03.746 --> 00:29:04.256 A:middle
attributed text.

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:06.156 A:middle
So if you've got to mix it up,

00:29:06.736 --> 00:29:08.096 A:middle
you can explicitly supply the

00:29:08.096 --> 00:29:09.876 A:middle
attributes when creating that

00:29:09.876 --> 00:29:11.216 A:middle
new attributed string from the

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:11.846 A:middle
plain text string.

00:29:11.846 --> 00:29:13.596 A:middle
And if we make sure to apply the

00:29:13.656 --> 00:29:14.526 A:middle
same attributes from the

00:29:14.526 --> 00:29:15.716 A:middle
original text, we'll get the

00:29:15.716 --> 00:29:16.356 A:middle
correct result.

00:29:16.886 --> 00:29:19.816 A:middle
But you should be aware that

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:20.896 A:middle
this reset effect can happen

00:29:20.896 --> 00:29:22.126 A:middle
with any attributes that have

00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:23.456 A:middle
default values and not just

00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:23.736 A:middle
fonts.

00:29:24.816 --> 00:29:26.106 A:middle
And as you can see, there are a

00:29:26.106 --> 00:29:27.326 A:middle
lot of attributes with default

00:29:27.326 --> 00:29:27.676 A:middle
values.

00:29:27.676 --> 00:29:30.746 A:middle
So I'd like to call out the

00:29:30.746 --> 00:29:31.986 A:middle
paragraph style here in

00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.506 A:middle
particular as being a sneaky

00:29:33.506 --> 00:29:34.096 A:middle
reset point.

00:29:35.056 --> 00:29:36.466 A:middle
And to see why, we'll revisit

00:29:36.466 --> 00:29:37.256 A:middle
our earlier example.

00:29:37.406 --> 00:29:38.496 A:middle
But instead of changing the

00:29:38.496 --> 00:29:39.826 A:middle
font, we're going to change the

00:29:39.826 --> 00:29:41.576 A:middle
paragraph style to truncate the

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:43.136 A:middle
word hate because nobody likes

00:29:43.646 --> 00:29:43.746 A:middle
hate.

00:29:44.376 --> 00:29:45.786 A:middle
So we want our text to look like

00:29:45.856 --> 00:29:47.886 A:middle
this, but when we run this code,

00:29:48.716 --> 00:29:49.836 A:middle
we'll get a result like this

00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:51.696 A:middle
with all of the text in

00:29:51.696 --> 00:29:53.526 A:middle
Helvetica 12 and using the

00:29:53.526 --> 00:29:55.136 A:middle
default paragraph style with the

00:29:55.136 --> 00:29:56.526 A:middle
default line break mode of word

00:29:56.526 --> 00:29:56.866 A:middle
wrapping.

00:29:57.566 --> 00:29:59.016 A:middle
And, again, this is really great

00:29:59.016 --> 00:29:59.956 A:middle
for those of you who loathe

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.056 A:middle
Comic Sans because it's been
