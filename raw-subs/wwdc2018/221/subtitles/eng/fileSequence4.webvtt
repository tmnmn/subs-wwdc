00:03:57.596 --> 00:04:00.196 A:middle
And AppKit doesn't have a label

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
control.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:02.106 A:middle
So if you need to display text,

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:04.546 A:middle
use an NSTextField and you can

00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:05.546 A:middle
disable both editing and

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:06.616 A:middle
selection to get that label

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:07.036 A:middle
behavior.

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:10.566 A:middle
Now going back to the top here.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:12.286 A:middle
If you do need text input, again

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:13.526 A:middle
ask if you need secure text

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:13.806 A:middle
entry.

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:15.856 A:middle
And if so, you can use

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:16.766 A:middle
NSSecureTextField.

00:04:17.176 --> 00:04:19.296 A:middle
Otherwise, we're going to ask

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:20.596 A:middle
our favorite question, how much

00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:22.346 A:middle
text do you expect?

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.116 A:middle
So NSTextView is optimized for

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:26.286 A:middle
performance with large amounts

00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:26.556 A:middle
of text.

00:04:26.946 --> 00:04:28.416 A:middle
And so if you're expecting a lot

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.506 A:middle
of text, you should use

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.556 A:middle
NSTextView otherwise you can use

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:33.216 A:middle
NSTextField.

00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:34.986 A:middle
Now, unlike its UIKit

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:36.926 A:middle
counterpart, NSTextField does

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.136 A:middle
support multiple lines of text,

00:04:39.056 --> 00:04:40.086 A:middle
but it's still optimized for

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.556 A:middle
shorter strings and so you

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:43.076 A:middle
should still use NSTextView if

00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:45.766 A:middle
you have a lot of text.

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:46.636 A:middle
Now those of you who have been

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:47.616 A:middle
around the block a few times

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:49.336 A:middle
with TextKit might notice that

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.266 A:middle
the flow charts are missing an

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:51.616 A:middle
option and that's string

00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:51.896 A:middle
drawing.

00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:54.416 A:middle
And you use string drawing by

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:56.016 A:middle
directly calling draw in point

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.396 A:middle
or draw in rect methods under

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.296 A:middle
NSString or your

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.236 A:middle
NSAttributedString.
