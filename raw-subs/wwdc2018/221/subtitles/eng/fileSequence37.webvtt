And for NSTextFields, you should

00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:03.126 A:middle
use a custom NSFormatter to

00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:04.426 A:middle
implement your validation logic.

00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:07.656 A:middle
Oh, and we've also got some

00:37:07.796 --> 00:37:09.146 A:middle
additional security enhancements

00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:09.706 A:middle
coming your way.

00:37:10.386 --> 00:37:11.396 A:middle
So keep an eye out for them in

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:12.816 A:middle
the release notes and come see

00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:13.856 A:middle
us at the labs this week if you

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:14.526 A:middle
have any questions.

00:37:15.176 --> 00:37:16.666 A:middle
All right.

00:37:16.876 --> 00:37:18.886 A:middle
We're just about out of time so

00:37:18.886 --> 00:37:19.456 A:middle
let's recap.

00:37:20.436 --> 00:37:21.516 A:middle
You know how to choose the right

00:37:21.516 --> 00:37:23.286 A:middle
control, customization point,

00:37:23.786 --> 00:37:25.466 A:middle
and customization approach and

00:37:25.466 --> 00:37:26.626 A:middle
you know the best practices to

00:37:26.626 --> 00:37:27.646 A:middle
follow in the areas of

00:37:27.646 --> 00:37:29.326 A:middle
correctness, performance, and

00:37:29.326 --> 00:37:29.876 A:middle
security.

00:37:30.626 --> 00:37:32.066 A:middle
So use this knowledge to go

00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:33.476 A:middle
forth and create great things

00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:34.216 A:middle
with TextKit.

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:36.946 A:middle
Oh, and before you go, here's

00:37:36.946 --> 00:37:38.066 A:middle

00:37:39.346 --> 00:37:40.506 A:middle
find all of the great past

00:37:40.506 --> 00:37:41.766 A:middle

00:37:41.766 --> 00:37:42.596 A:middle
we've referenced today.

00:37:43.096 --> 00:37:44.326 A:middle
And come visit us at the labs on

00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:45.036 A:middle
