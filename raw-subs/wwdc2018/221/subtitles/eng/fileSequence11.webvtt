00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:02.476 A:middle
the end of the session.

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:02.946 A:middle
All right.

00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:04.946 A:middle
So we've looked at the built-in

00:11:04.946 --> 00:11:05.576 A:middle
text controls.

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:07.236 A:middle
We've looked at the components

00:11:07.236 --> 00:11:07.766 A:middle
in TextKit.

00:11:07.976 --> 00:11:09.016 A:middle
And we've look at how to

00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.336 A:middle
configure those components to

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.066 A:middle
achieve different effects.

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:12.956 A:middle
And there's a lot that you can

00:11:12.956 --> 00:11:14.406 A:middle
do with that knowledge already,

00:11:14.636 --> 00:11:15.586 A:middle
but if you need even more,

00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:17.056 A:middle
you'll need to extend and

00:11:17.056 --> 00:11:18.216 A:middle
customize parts of TextKit

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:18.596 A:middle
yourself.

00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:21.076 A:middle
And so now we'll talk a little

00:11:21.076 --> 00:11:22.166 A:middle
bit about choosing the right

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.766 A:middle
approach for doing that.

00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:26.516 A:middle
And choosing the right approach

00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:27.686 A:middle
is like building up your text

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:28.036 A:middle
toolbox.

00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:29.806 A:middle
It's like going to the store

00:11:29.806 --> 00:11:30.606 A:middle
because you need a hammer.

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:32.056 A:middle
And then when you get there, you

00:11:32.056 --> 00:11:33.246 A:middle
encounter this giant wall of

00:11:33.246 --> 00:11:34.216 A:middle
hammers to choose from.

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:36.086 A:middle
And you want to pick your hammer

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:38.206 A:middle
that can do the job and ideally

00:11:38.286 --> 00:11:39.526 A:middle
the least expensive one that

00:11:39.526 --> 00:11:40.346 A:middle
will do what you need.

00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:43.416 A:middle
And so these are the hammers

00:11:43.566 --> 00:11:44.456 A:middle
that are available to us.

00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:46.836 A:middle
Delegation is like your standard

00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:48.046 A:middle
hammer with the claw on the end,

00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:48.866 A:middle
and it's used to perform

00:11:48.866 --> 00:11:49.626 A:middle
multiple tasks.

00:11:50.316 --> 00:11:51.466 A:middle
So the delegates have a lot of

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:52.566 A:middle
different customization hooks

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:53.766 A:middle
and most of the time they'll get

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:56.206 A:middle
the job done for you.

00:11:56.426 --> 00:11:57.686 A:middle
Notifications is like a

00:11:57.686 --> 00:11:58.446 A:middle
ball-peen hammer.

00:11:58.596 --> 00:11:59.666 A:middle
And this has a ball on the end

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
instead of a claw so it's more
