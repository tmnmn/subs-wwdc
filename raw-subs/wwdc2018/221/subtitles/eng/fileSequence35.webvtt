00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.176 A:middle
protections might not be enough

00:35:00.296 --> 00:35:01.836 A:middle
to fend off an attack but

00:35:01.836 --> 00:35:03.556 A:middle
collectively they provide a

00:35:03.676 --> 00:35:04.356 A:middle
strong defense.

00:35:05.066 --> 00:35:07.796 A:middle
And like the castle, we here at

00:35:07.796 --> 00:35:09.246 A:middle
Apple provide multiple layers of

00:35:09.246 --> 00:35:11.126 A:middle
defense against attacks, but

00:35:11.126 --> 00:35:12.246 A:middle
there's nothing stopping you

00:35:12.316 --> 00:35:13.376 A:middle
from also taking your own

00:35:13.376 --> 00:35:14.636 A:middle
defensive measures in your app

00:35:14.636 --> 00:35:15.106 A:middle
or framework.

00:35:15.776 --> 00:35:17.266 A:middle
And by doing this, you're adding

00:35:17.266 --> 00:35:18.596 A:middle
another layer of protection and

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:19.936 A:middle
improving your product security.

00:35:20.406 --> 00:35:21.066 A:middle
Everyone wins.

00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:23.216 A:middle
So let's talk about what you can

00:35:23.866 --> 00:35:25.466 A:middle
do here.

00:35:25.676 --> 00:35:26.556 A:middle
And something I'd like you to

00:35:26.556 --> 00:35:28.626 A:middle
consider is setting limits on

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:30.106 A:middle
text input in your app or

00:35:30.106 --> 00:35:30.506 A:middle
framework.

00:35:31.426 --> 00:35:32.766 A:middle
And now I'd like to emphasize

00:35:32.766 --> 00:35:33.766 A:middle
that this might not always make

00:35:33.816 --> 00:35:34.456 A:middle
sense to do.

00:35:34.756 --> 00:35:36.106 A:middle
So, for example, if your app is

00:35:36.106 --> 00:35:37.606 A:middle
an authoring tool like that

00:35:37.606 --> 00:35:38.736 A:middle
journal app that Emily showed

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.336 A:middle
earlier, it wouldn't really make

00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:42.066 A:middle
any sense to set a limit on the

00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:42.986 A:middle
length of the text there.

00:35:43.296 --> 00:35:44.276 A:middle
So if it doesn't make sense, you

00:35:44.516 --> 00:35:45.626 A:middle
shouldn't do it.

00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:47.996 A:middle
But in contrast, if your phone

00:35:47.996 --> 00:35:49.436 A:middle
app has a text field for

00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:50.886 A:middle
assigning a nickname to an

00:35:50.886 --> 00:35:52.676 A:middle
account, you probably have some

00:35:52.676 --> 00:35:53.816 A:middle
idea what a reasonable limit

00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:54.266 A:middle
would be there.

00:35:54.846 --> 00:35:57.456 A:middle
And it's a good idea to set

00:35:57.456 --> 00:35:58.926 A:middle
these limits because all text

00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:00.916 A:middle
input is potentially untrusted.
