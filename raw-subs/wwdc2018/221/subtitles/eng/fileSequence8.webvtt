00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.546 A:middle
how that layout process works.

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:03.166 A:middle
So text layout happens after the

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.596 A:middle
system fixes attributes in the

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:06.006 A:middle
text storage to remove

00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:08.206 A:middle
inconsistencies like making sure

00:08:08.206 --> 00:08:09.626 A:middle
that all the characters in the

00:08:09.626 --> 00:08:11.206 A:middle
string are covered by fonts that

00:08:11.246 --> 00:08:12.156 A:middle
support displaying those

00:08:12.186 --> 00:08:12.626 A:middle
characters.

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:14.906 A:middle
And so in this example, the

00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:15.996 A:middle
Times New Roman font is

00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:17.566 A:middle
specified for the entire string,

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:19.486 A:middle
but this font doesn't support

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
displaying Japanese kanji or

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:21.906 A:middle
emoji.

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.536 A:middle
And so after attribute fixing,

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:25.446 A:middle
your text storage will look

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:26.876 A:middle
something like this with an

00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:28.146 A:middle
appropriate Japanese font

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:29.346 A:middle
assigned to the Japanese

00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:31.186 A:middle
characters and the emoji font

00:08:31.186 --> 00:08:32.476 A:middle
assigned to the emoji character.

00:08:32.476 --> 00:08:33.145 A:middle
All right.

00:08:33.856 --> 00:08:36.006 A:middle
So once the attributes are

00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:37.405 A:middle
fixed, the layout process can

00:08:37.405 --> 00:08:37.666 A:middle
begin.

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:39.606 A:middle
And we can think of layout in

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:41.806 A:middle
two steps: glyph generation

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:42.866 A:middle
followed by glyph layout.

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:45.366 A:middle
And once they're laid out,

00:08:45.646 --> 00:08:46.456 A:middle
they're ready for display.

00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:48.606 A:middle
But wait a minute.

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:49.356 A:middle
What's a glyph?

00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:51.226 A:middle
Let's back up and review that.

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:53.296 A:middle
A glyph is a visual

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:54.536 A:middle
representation of one or more

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:55.046 A:middle
characters.

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:56.916 A:middle
And as you can see here, the

00:08:56.916 --> 00:08:58.056 A:middle
mapping between characters and

00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:00.066 A:middle
glyphs is not always one-to-one.
