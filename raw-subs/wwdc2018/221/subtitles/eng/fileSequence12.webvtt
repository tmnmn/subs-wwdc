00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
instead of a claw so it's more

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:03.196 A:middle
specialized and it's better

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:04.866 A:middle
suited for certain tasks, but

00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:06.466 A:middle
it's not as versatile as the

00:12:06.466 --> 00:12:07.956 A:middle
standard hammer of delegation.

00:12:08.506 --> 00:12:11.546 A:middle
And finally, subclassing is your

00:12:11.546 --> 00:12:12.106 A:middle
sledgehammer.

00:12:13.496 --> 00:12:14.596 A:middle
The sledgehammer is very

00:12:14.596 --> 00:12:16.096 A:middle
powerful, and you can use it for

00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:17.596 A:middle
just about anything that you

00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:19.136 A:middle
would need a hammer for but it's

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.466 A:middle
probably overkill for a lot of

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:20.756 A:middle
things.

00:12:21.386 --> 00:12:23.396 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:24.606 A:middle
invite Emily up to show us how

00:12:24.606 --> 00:12:25.596 A:middle
to use these different kinds of

00:12:25.596 --> 00:12:25.936 A:middle
hammers.

00:12:26.326 --> 00:12:26.656 A:middle
Emily.

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:32.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:33.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Donna.

00:12:34.396 --> 00:12:36.106 A:middle
So, as developers, we have a

00:12:36.106 --> 00:12:37.506 A:middle
collection of controls to choose

00:12:37.566 --> 00:12:39.676 A:middle
from, various configurations,

00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:41.036 A:middle
and a wide range of

00:12:41.036 --> 00:12:42.786 A:middle
customization options to achieve

00:12:42.786 --> 00:12:43.266 A:middle
what we need.

00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:45.406 A:middle
So our tool chest is stocked

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:47.656 A:middle
full, but how do we know what

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:48.346 A:middle
tools to choose?

00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:51.696 A:middle
So we're going to take a look at

00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:52.886 A:middle
some examples of apps that

00:12:52.886 --> 00:12:54.326 A:middle
harness the power of TextKit.

00:12:55.326 --> 00:12:56.326 A:middle
And we don't have to look very

00:12:56.326 --> 00:12:58.436 A:middle
far because almost every app

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:00.536 A:middle
that we use displays or edits
