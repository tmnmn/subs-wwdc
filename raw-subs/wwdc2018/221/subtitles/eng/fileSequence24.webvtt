00:23:58.866 --> 00:24:00.376 A:middle
And now we have two text views

00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:01.596 A:middle
but we want them to display the

00:24:01.696 --> 00:24:03.546 A:middle
same content but look a little

00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:04.286 A:middle
different on the right.

00:24:05.916 --> 00:24:07.176 A:middle
So we want a configuration like

00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:08.806 A:middle
this where we have one text

00:24:08.806 --> 00:24:10.716 A:middle
storage but two of everything

00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:11.666 A:middle
else.

00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:16.506 A:middle
To do this, we will replace the

00:24:16.506 --> 00:24:17.996 A:middle
text storage on the right with

00:24:18.066 --> 00:24:19.106 A:middle
that from the left.

00:24:20.616 --> 00:24:21.506 A:middle
Now let's see what this looks

00:24:21.536 --> 00:24:21.766 A:middle
like.

00:24:22.286 --> 00:24:25.186 A:middle
Now this is actually really

00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:25.326 A:middle
cool.

00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:26.626 A:middle
If we add any characters to the

00:24:26.626 --> 00:24:27.636 A:middle
left, they'll show up

00:24:27.636 --> 00:24:28.556 A:middle
immediately on the right-hand

00:24:28.556 --> 00:24:28.826 A:middle
side.

00:24:29.726 --> 00:24:31.056 A:middle
Now usually the right-hand side

00:24:31.906 --> 00:24:33.166 A:middle
doesn't really show the Markdown

00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:35.406 A:middle
characters but since this is a

00:24:35.406 --> 00:24:38.036 A:middle
shared text storage, it means we

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:39.196 A:middle
have to hide the characters

00:24:39.406 --> 00:24:40.486 A:middle
during the layout process.

00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:44.236 A:middle
Now since we need to do it this

00:24:44.236 --> 00:24:45.846 A:middle
way, we really only have one

00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:48.486 A:middle
option and that's to implement

00:24:49.016 --> 00:24:50.746 A:middle
the shouldGenerateGlyphs method

00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:52.746 A:middle
on the NSLayoutManager delegate.

00:24:53.796 --> 00:24:55.196 A:middle
This will allow us to intervene

00:24:55.316 --> 00:24:57.446 A:middle
in the glyph generation process.

00:24:58.036 --> 00:24:59.776 A:middle
So we can take the glyphs that

00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:01.986 A:middle
are about to be laid out and if
