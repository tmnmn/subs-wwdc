00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:00.716 A:middle
We can see that the text

00:19:00.756 --> 00:19:02.956 A:middle
container has been resized to

00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:04.386 A:middle
match the dimensions of a piece

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.056 A:middle
of paper.

00:19:06.176 --> 00:19:07.696 A:middle
Now if we scroll down, we can

00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:08.866 A:middle
see that the text jumps from the

00:19:08.866 --> 00:19:09.946 A:middle
first page to the second.

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:12.116 A:middle
Now the standard configuration

00:19:12.116 --> 00:19:13.266 A:middle
doesn't really support layout

00:19:13.266 --> 00:19:13.636 A:middle
like this.

00:19:15.066 --> 00:19:16.626 A:middle
Sure enough, this layout uses

00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:17.856 A:middle
two text views and text

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:18.326 A:middle
containers.

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:20.006 A:middle
Now they're still managed by the

00:19:20.106 --> 00:19:21.276 A:middle
same layout manager and text

00:19:21.276 --> 00:19:22.626 A:middle
storage, which allows the text

00:19:22.626 --> 00:19:24.176 A:middle
to freely jump from one page to

00:19:25.016 --> 00:19:26.566 A:middle
the next.

00:19:26.776 --> 00:19:27.926 A:middle
Now if you'd like to see more

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:29.276 A:middle
about how TextEdit works, you

00:19:29.276 --> 00:19:31.136 A:middle
can actually find its source in

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:32.116 A:middle
the guides and sample codes

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:32.546 A:middle
library.

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:36.046 A:middle
So we've picked the right

00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:37.666 A:middle
controls, we've picked the right

00:19:37.666 --> 00:19:39.716 A:middle
configuration, but sometimes we

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:41.016 A:middle
actually need to hammer on these

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:42.126 A:middle
to achieve what we want.

00:19:43.346 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
But how do we decide which

00:19:44.386 --> 00:19:45.076 A:middle
hammer to use?

00:19:45.806 --> 00:19:49.006 A:middle
So we're going to try and pick

00:19:49.006 --> 00:19:50.166 A:middle
the right hammer for the job

00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:51.526 A:middle
when we go through the steps of

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:53.146 A:middle
building a journal app together.

00:19:54.516 --> 00:19:55.876 A:middle
We'll start by putting today's

00:19:55.946 --> 00:19:57.056 A:middle
date on to the window.

00:19:58.316 --> 00:19:59.546 A:middle
Now we don't have UILabels in

00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:01.226 A:middle
AppKit, but we can make a text
