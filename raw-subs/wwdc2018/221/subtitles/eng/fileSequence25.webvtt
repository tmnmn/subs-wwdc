00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:01.986 A:middle
are about to be laid out and if

00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:03.446 A:middle
they represent a Markdown

00:25:03.446 --> 00:25:05.446 A:middle
control character, we can apply

00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:07.356 A:middle
the null property to that glyph.

00:25:08.096 --> 00:25:09.216 A:middle
Now this will eliminate the

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.516 A:middle
glyph altogether during the

00:25:10.516 --> 00:25:12.526 A:middle
layout process without changing

00:25:12.526 --> 00:25:13.756 A:middle
the underlying text storage.

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:19.096 A:middle
Then, we will use the new glyphs

00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:20.686 A:middle
and tell the layout manager that

00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:22.046 A:middle
we want to present these glyphs

00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:23.116 A:middle
with our new properties.

00:25:27.096 --> 00:25:28.766 A:middle
Now this is actually really

00:25:28.766 --> 00:25:29.106 A:middle
cool.

00:25:29.106 --> 00:25:30.416 A:middle
So the left-hand side shows an

00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:31.436 A:middle
editable version with all the

00:25:31.436 --> 00:25:32.626 A:middle
Markdown characters included.

00:25:32.956 --> 00:25:34.576 A:middle
And the right-hand side shows no

00:25:34.576 --> 00:25:36.306 A:middle
Markdown characters all, all

00:25:36.306 --> 00:25:37.686 A:middle
using the same text storage.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:40.836 A:middle
Now building a side-by-side

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:42.046 A:middle
Markdown editor is not something

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:44.256 A:middle
all of us do every day, but it

00:25:44.256 --> 00:25:45.536 A:middle
was really good to see how

00:25:45.536 --> 00:25:47.856 A:middle
customizable TextKit is with

00:25:47.856 --> 00:25:48.816 A:middle
real world examples.

00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:51.626 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:25:51.626 --> 00:25:53.026 A:middle
about how to use and customize

00:25:53.066 --> 00:25:54.816 A:middle
TextKit, check out our amazing

00:25:54.816 --> 00:25:55.576 A:middle
programming guides.

00:25:56.286 --> 00:25:57.646 A:middle
And with that, I will hand it

00:25:57.646 --> 00:25:58.186 A:middle
back to Donna.
