00:21:58.346 --> 00:22:01.126 A:middle
Now we're feeling pretty good

00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:02.426 A:middle
about this whole Markdown thing

00:22:02.586 --> 00:22:04.856 A:middle
so what if we try inserting a

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:05.476 A:middle
code snippet?

00:22:06.756 --> 00:22:07.836 A:middle
Now in Markdown it looks like

00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:07.996 A:middle
this.

00:22:09.256 --> 00:22:10.516 A:middle
And if we add this last

00:22:10.636 --> 00:22:12.116 A:middle
back-tick, we want it to look

00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:12.766 A:middle
like a code block.

00:22:14.136 --> 00:22:15.156 A:middle
It should have a background and

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:16.346 A:middle
a header that says Swift Code.

00:22:17.716 --> 00:22:18.906 A:middle
Now this is actually a complex

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:21.216 A:middle
task, so we're going to need two

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:22.006 A:middle
sledgehammers.

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:24.716 A:middle
And the first is a subclass

00:22:24.886 --> 00:22:25.526 A:middle
NSTextStorage.

00:22:26.556 --> 00:22:27.946 A:middle
Now when we subclass

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:28.916 A:middle
NSTextStorage, we need to

00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:30.706 A:middle
implement four required methods.

00:22:31.236 --> 00:22:32.806 A:middle
And we can do this by operating

00:22:32.856 --> 00:22:34.336 A:middle
on a private instance of a

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:34.946 A:middle
mutable string.

00:22:34.946 --> 00:22:37.996 A:middle
Now let's pay attention to the

00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:39.056 A:middle
replaceCharacters method.

00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:42.066 A:middle
Now we can add an NSTextBlock to

00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:42.876 A:middle
our paragraph style.

00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:46.046 A:middle
And then we can add that

00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:47.546 A:middle
paragraph style to our text

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:49.116 A:middle
storage over the range of that

00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:49.496 A:middle
code block.

00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:51.746 A:middle
Now NSTextBlock by itself

00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:53.526 A:middle
doesn't do any custom drawing by

00:22:53.526 --> 00:22:53.906 A:middle
itself.

00:22:54.596 --> 00:22:56.766 A:middle
So we'll need to subclass that

00:22:57.916 --> 00:22:57.996 A:middle
too.

00:22:58.226 --> 00:23:00.846 A:middle
Our NSTextBlock subclass needs
