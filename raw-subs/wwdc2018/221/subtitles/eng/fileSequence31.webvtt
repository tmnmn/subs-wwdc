00:30:59.216 --> 00:31:00.146 A:middle
drawn with the correct colors

00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:03.116 A:middle
for the context.

00:31:03.216 --> 00:31:03.786 A:middle
So moving on.

00:31:04.316 --> 00:31:05.416 A:middle
The next topic is performance.

00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:07.116 A:middle
If you're working with large

00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:08.656 A:middle
amounts of text, a good way to

00:31:08.656 --> 00:31:10.046 A:middle
improve your apps performance is

00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:11.636 A:middle
to use noncontinuous layout.

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:14.076 A:middle
And to understand what that

00:31:14.076 --> 00:31:15.276 A:middle
means, let's revisit our old

00:31:15.336 --> 00:31:16.766 A:middle
friend the layout process.

00:31:17.826 --> 00:31:18.856 A:middle
We said that the layout process

00:31:18.896 --> 00:31:20.436 A:middle
consists of glyph generation

00:31:20.526 --> 00:31:21.386 A:middle
followed by glyph layout.

00:31:22.806 --> 00:31:24.046 A:middle
And so with continuous layout,

00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:25.416 A:middle
the layout manager is going to

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.716 A:middle
perform glyph generation and

00:31:26.716 --> 00:31:27.946 A:middle
glyph layout starting at the

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:29.496 A:middle
beginning of the text storage.

00:31:30.286 --> 00:31:31.546 A:middle
And it goes in order from the

00:31:31.546 --> 00:31:32.426 A:middle
beginning to the end.

00:31:33.786 --> 00:31:34.986 A:middle
And so if someone using your app

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:36.066 A:middle
scrolls to some point in the

00:31:36.066 --> 00:31:37.556 A:middle
middle of your text view, the

00:31:37.556 --> 00:31:38.966 A:middle
layout manager has to generate

00:31:38.966 --> 00:31:41.056 A:middle
and layout the glyphs for all

00:31:41.056 --> 00:31:42.316 A:middle
the glyphs that come before that

00:31:42.316 --> 00:31:44.106 A:middle
point as indicated by the red

00:31:44.106 --> 00:31:44.596 A:middle
rectangle.

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:46.726 A:middle
And note that this also includes

00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:47.846 A:middle
the text that you can't see

00:31:47.846 --> 00:31:49.016 A:middle
that's been scrolled off the top

00:31:49.016 --> 00:31:50.116 A:middle
of the screen all the way back

00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:51.196 A:middle
to the beginning of the text

00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:51.596 A:middle
storage.

00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:54.186 A:middle
And so if you have a lot of

00:31:54.236 --> 00:31:56.406 A:middle
text, that poor person might

00:31:56.406 --> 00:31:57.756 A:middle
have to wait a while for your

00:31:57.756 --> 00:31:59.946 A:middle
app to finish layout but

00:31:59.946 --> 00:32:01.626 A:middle
luckily, we can avoid this
