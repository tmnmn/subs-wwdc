00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:00.066 A:middle
glyphs is not always one-to-one.

00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:03.286 A:middle
So here this string ffi has

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:04.996 A:middle
three characters, but it could

00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:06.476 A:middle
be represented by a single glyph

00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:07.096 A:middle
for the ligature.

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:09.176 A:middle
And you can go in the other

00:09:09.176 --> 00:09:09.726 A:middle
direction too.

00:09:10.456 --> 00:09:11.626 A:middle
Here we have n [inaudible] which

00:09:11.846 --> 00:09:13.436 A:middle
is a single character that can

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:14.436 A:middle
be represented by multiple

00:09:14.436 --> 00:09:16.786 A:middle
glyphs: one for the n and one

00:09:16.786 --> 00:09:17.226 A:middle
for the tilde.

00:09:18.836 --> 00:09:20.416 A:middle
And so going back to our diagram

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:22.456 A:middle
here, we have NSLayoutManager

00:09:22.456 --> 00:09:24.206 A:middle
performing glyph generation and

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:24.726 A:middle
glyph layout.

00:09:25.486 --> 00:09:27.036 A:middle
And glyph generation is where

00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:28.096 A:middle
the layout manager takes the

00:09:28.096 --> 00:09:29.446 A:middle
characters and figures out what

00:09:29.476 --> 00:09:30.396 A:middle
glyphs need to be drawn.

00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:32.716 A:middle
And glyph layout is where the

00:09:32.716 --> 00:09:34.056 A:middle
layout manager positions those

00:09:34.056 --> 00:09:35.646 A:middle
glyphs for display in your view.

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:38.416 A:middle
And there's a lot more to learn

00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:39.876 A:middle
about the layout manager from

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:41.536 A:middle
these past WWDC sessions and

00:09:41.536 --> 00:09:42.216 A:middle
documentation.

00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:43.916 A:middle
And you can access them from,

00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:45.596 A:middle
you guessed it, the more

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:46.936 A:middle
information link at the end of

00:09:47.596 --> 00:09:49.416 A:middle
the session.

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.976 A:middle
Okay. So now you understand the

00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:53.096 A:middle
phases of the text system.

00:09:53.466 --> 00:09:54.296 A:middle
And you know the TextKit

00:09:54.296 --> 00:09:55.366 A:middle
components that make up each

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:55.666 A:middle
phase.

00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:58.796 A:middle
So now let's explore choosing

00:09:58.796 --> 00:10:00.336 A:middle
the right configuration of these
