00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.236 A:middle
NSAttributedString.

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:02.366 A:middle
And many of you may be using

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:03.696 A:middle
this for the performance benefit

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:05.236 A:middle
to avoid the overhead of view

00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:06.276 A:middle
objects at the kit level.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:08.446 A:middle
And so if you're going to go

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:09.836 A:middle
this route, please keep the

00:05:09.836 --> 00:05:10.826 A:middle
following tips in mind.

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:12.686 A:middle
You want to use it for small

00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:13.676 A:middle
amounts of static text.

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:14.926 A:middle
And you want to limit how

00:05:14.926 --> 00:05:16.066 A:middle
frequently you call the draw

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:16.396 A:middle
methods.

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:18.186 A:middle
Now if you're calling the string

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:20.296 A:middle
drawing methods a lot, you might

00:05:20.296 --> 00:05:21.626 A:middle
actually get better performance

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.706 A:middle
out of a label or a text field

00:05:23.846 --> 00:05:25.006 A:middle
because these controls provide

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:26.516 A:middle
better caching, especially if

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:27.306 A:middle
you're using auto layout.

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:29.216 A:middle
And if you're drawing an

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:31.056 A:middle
attributed string with a lot of

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.176 A:middle
custom attributes, this could

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:34.366 A:middle
also be slowing down your string

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:35.756 A:middle
drawing because the text system

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:36.936 A:middle
needs to validate all of the

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.966 A:middle
attributes before rendering and

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:40.386 A:middle
so for best performance, you

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:41.326 A:middle
should strip out extra

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:42.906 A:middle
attributes before drawing and

00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:44.776 A:middle
only pass in the ones that are

00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:46.706 A:middle
needed to determine the visual

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:48.236 A:middle
appearance like font or like

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:48.506 A:middle
color.

00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:51.996 A:middle
And finally, remember that by

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:53.146 A:middle
using string drawing, you'll

00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:54.546 A:middle
miss out on all of this free

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:55.746 A:middle
functionality that's offered by

00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:57.286 A:middle
the text controls, so you should

00:05:57.286 --> 00:05:58.746 A:middle
use the text controls whenever

00:05:58.746 --> 00:05:59.166 A:middle
possible.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.706 A:middle
So now you know what you can do
