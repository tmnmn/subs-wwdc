&gt;&gt; Thanks Michael.

00:41:04.636 --> 00:41:05.546 A:middle
If you haven't implemented

00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:06.946 A:middle
handling of these JSON fields

00:41:06.946 --> 00:41:08.506 A:middle
yet we highly recommend you try

00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:09.546 A:middle
it and watch the great effect it

00:41:09.546 --> 00:41:10.856 A:middle
has on your retention rates.

00:41:11.496 --> 00:41:12.666 A:middle
It's not often as engineers we

00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:13.616 A:middle
get the chance to make such

00:41:13.736 --> 00:41:15.136 A:middle
simple architectural tweaks that

00:41:15.136 --> 00:41:17.226 A:middle
can have such a big effect on a

00:41:17.226 --> 00:41:18.826 A:middle
business' revenue, so take a

00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:18.996 A:middle
look.

00:41:20.066 --> 00:41:21.266 A:middle
Now we've got some great new

00:41:21.266 --> 00:41:22.536 A:middle
updates today in the areas of

00:41:22.536 --> 00:41:23.606 A:middle
analytics and reporting.

00:41:24.756 --> 00:41:26.526 A:middle
Located in App Store Connect the

00:41:26.526 --> 00:41:27.736 A:middle
sales and trends section

00:41:27.736 --> 00:41:29.126 A:middle
contains a huge amount of useful

00:41:29.126 --> 00:41:29.686 A:middle
information.

00:41:30.146 --> 00:41:31.156 A:middle
Now you can get even more

00:41:31.156 --> 00:41:32.096 A:middle
insight into your app's

00:41:32.146 --> 00:41:32.726 A:middle
performance.

00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:34.886 A:middle
This existing subscription

00:41:34.886 --> 00:41:36.766 A:middle
summary dashboard now includes

00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:38.126 A:middle
monitoring for subscriptions

00:41:38.126 --> 00:41:39.526 A:middle
that are in those Billing Retry

00:41:39.526 --> 00:41:40.076 A:middle
windows.

00:41:41.256 --> 00:41:42.456 A:middle
This is great for gaining

00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:43.686 A:middle
insight into your subscriber

00:41:43.686 --> 00:41:44.826 A:middle
behavior and to determine the

00:41:44.826 --> 00:41:46.106 A:middle
most effective amount of time to

00:41:46.106 --> 00:41:47.396 A:middle
offer those grace periods for

00:41:47.396 --> 00:41:49.306 A:middle
like Michael just talked about.

00:41:50.196 --> 00:41:52.116 A:middle
This year we're also introducing

00:41:52.116 --> 00:41:53.666 A:middle

subscription retention.
