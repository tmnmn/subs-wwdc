00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
to a device clock change.

00:06:01.786 --> 00:06:02.996 A:middle
If you're using on-device

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:03.946 A:middle
receipt validation for

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.246 A:middle
subscription management on the

00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:06.256 A:middle
user's device there's actually

00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:07.306 A:middle
nothing stopping the user from

00:06:07.536 --> 00:06:08.656 A:middle
winding their clock back and

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:10.216 A:middle
putting themselves into a valid

00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:11.336 A:middle
subscription period, maybe a

00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:12.996 A:middle
free trial that they've actually

00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:14.206 A:middle
lapsed their subscription from.

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:17.396 A:middle
And finally, it's just a little

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:17.756 A:middle
simpler.

00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:19.986 A:middle
The server-to-server validation

00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:21.046 A:middle
you're dealing with JSON API,

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:23.506 A:middle
you don't have to build OpenSSL

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:24.956 A:middle
or use ASN.1 decoding.

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:26.526 A:middle
So with all these things in mind

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:27.556 A:middle
we're really encouraging more

00:06:27.556 --> 00:06:28.516 A:middle
and more people to actually

00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:29.636 A:middle
adopt server-to-server

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:30.896 A:middle
validation when it comes to

00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:32.486 A:middle
maintaining an auto renewable

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:33.346 A:middle
subscription state.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:36.436 A:middle
If you've got a simple utility

00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:37.506 A:middle
app that doesn't need any kind

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:38.976 A:middle
of networking you can still use

00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:40.186 A:middle
on-device validation for

00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:41.316 A:middle
subscription management.

00:06:41.646 --> 00:06:42.246 A:middle
And if you're interested in

00:06:42.246 --> 00:06:43.446 A:middle
finding more about that I'd

00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:44.556 A:middle
invite you to check out the

00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:45.736 A:middle
video from last year's events

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:47.126 A:middle
StoreKit Talk where we went into

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:48.466 A:middle
more detail about on-device

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:49.246 A:middle
receipt validation.

00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:51.336 A:middle
But for the purposes of this

00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:52.356 A:middle
talk we're really going to focus

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:53.616 A:middle
more on the server to server

00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:55.186 A:middle
techniques outlined here.

00:06:56.256 --> 00:06:57.496 A:middle
So let's go back to our example

00:06:57.496 --> 00:06:58.326 A:middle
and see how we can use

00:06:58.326 --> 00:06:59.536 A:middle
server-to-server validation for

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:00.386 A:middle
this transaction that we're
