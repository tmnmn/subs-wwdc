00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:01.056 A:middle
groups this user has used offers

00:23:01.106 --> 00:23:01.356 A:middle
for.

00:23:02.866 --> 00:23:03.776 A:middle
Now when you want to render the

00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:05.306 A:middle
price string of say product A it

00:23:06.136 --> 00:23:07.196 A:middle
becomes a simpler check.

00:23:07.606 --> 00:23:08.976 A:middle
You can check to see if this

00:23:08.976 --> 00:23:10.616 A:middle
user's list of consumed group

00:23:10.616 --> 00:23:12.316 A:middle
discounts contains the group

00:23:12.316 --> 00:23:13.346 A:middle
identifier for the one you want

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:14.196 A:middle
to sell them, in this case

00:23:14.266 --> 00:23:14.646 A:middle
product A.

00:23:14.646 --> 00:23:17.196 A:middle
And if it does, that's an

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:18.406 A:middle
indication that this user has

00:23:18.406 --> 00:23:19.576 A:middle
actually used an introductory

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:20.876 A:middle
offer here before, so you can

00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:22.666 A:middle
render the normal price string

00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:23.676 A:middle
to this particular user.

00:23:24.286 --> 00:23:25.776 A:middle
But if not, they're still

00:23:25.776 --> 00:23:27.016 A:middle
eligible for that introductory

00:23:27.016 --> 00:23:28.156 A:middle
offer so you can use that

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:29.976 A:middle
introductory price located on

00:23:29.976 --> 00:23:31.036 A:middle
the SKProductObject.

00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:33.666 A:middle
Now when rendering the price

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.306 A:middle
string nothing's really changed

00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:37.206 A:middle
here it's the same techniques

00:23:37.206 --> 00:23:38.366 A:middle
that you use for rendering any

00:23:38.366 --> 00:23:39.676 A:middle
in-app purchase and I'm not

00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:40.546 A:middle
going to go into too much more

00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:41.776 A:middle
detail here, but I'd encourage

00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:42.746 A:middle
you to check out the video of

00:23:42.746 --> 00:23:44.086 A:middle
the session just before this one

00:23:44.316 --> 00:23:45.036 A:middle
where they talked about

00:23:45.036 --> 00:23:46.356 A:middle
rendering these price strings a

00:23:46.356 --> 00:23:47.276 A:middle
little more dynamically.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:49.106 A:middle
For more information about

00:23:49.186 --> 00:23:50.376 A:middle
setting up introductory offers

00:23:50.376 --> 00:23:51.536 A:middle
I'd also recommend you go to the

00:23:51.536 --> 00:23:52.616 A:middle
What's New in App Store Connect

00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:54.586 A:middle
session on Wednesday at 5 p.m.

00:23:54.586 --> 00:23:55.166 A:middle
in hall three.

00:23:55.766 --> 00:23:58.296 A:middle
So that's tip number two around

00:23:58.296 --> 00:23:59.056 A:middle
introductory pricing.

00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:00.616 A:middle
The third tip here is around
