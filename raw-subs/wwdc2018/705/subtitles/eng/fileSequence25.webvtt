to be able to do this.

00:25:01.286 --> 00:25:02.416 A:middle
To actually get to this screen

00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:03.546 A:middle
there's a link available on our

00:25:03.546 --> 00:25:04.676 A:middle
In-App Purchase Programming

00:25:04.676 --> 00:25:06.746 A:middle
Guide and here it is if you

00:25:06.746 --> 00:25:07.666 A:middle
enjoy writing down links.

00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:10.016 A:middle
So these are some simple

00:25:10.016 --> 00:25:11.716 A:middle
techniques you can implement in

00:25:11.716 --> 00:25:12.686 A:middle
your app to give a user a

00:25:12.686 --> 00:25:14.126 A:middle
pleasant experience using

00:25:14.126 --> 00:25:14.766 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:15.706 A:middle
Next, I'm going to hand it over

00:25:15.706 --> 00:25:16.896 A:middle
to my colleague Michael who's

00:25:16.896 --> 00:25:17.836 A:middle
going to go over some great

00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:19.206 A:middle
techniques for reducing your

00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:19.826 A:middle
subscriber churn.

00:25:19.826 --> 00:25:19.976 A:middle
Thanks.

00:25:30.046 --> 00:25:31.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, my name is

00:25:31.136 --> 00:25:32.226 A:middle
Michael Gargas and I'm a

00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:33.606 A:middle

00:25:33.606 --> 00:25:34.526 A:middle
Store operations team.

00:25:35.496 --> 00:25:36.716 A:middle
Today I want to talk about

00:25:36.766 --> 00:25:38.586 A:middle
reducing subscriber churn inside

00:25:38.586 --> 00:25:40.336 A:middle
your applications by using some

00:25:40.336 --> 00:25:41.796 A:middle
of the tactics and methods that

00:25:41.796 --> 00:25:43.426 A:middle
Pete just walked you through.

00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:46.176 A:middle
Today we'll cover involuntary

00:25:46.176 --> 00:25:48.006 A:middle
churn and voluntary churn, the

00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:49.116 A:middle
two types of churn you'll see

00:25:49.116 --> 00:25:50.046 A:middle
inside of your subscription

00:25:50.046 --> 00:25:51.986 A:middle
applications, as well as some

00:25:51.986 --> 00:25:53.116 A:middle
ways to win back those

00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:54.496 A:middle
subscribers that you potentially

00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:56.566 A:middle
may have lost or will lose.

00:25:57.436 --> 00:25:59.536 A:middle
First, let's talk about

00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:00.326 A:middle
involuntary churn.
