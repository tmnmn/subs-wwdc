00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:00.176 A:middle
You can set this up in App Store

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:01.416 A:middle
Connect and store it on your

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:01.696 A:middle
server.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.206 A:middle
And when you send this receipt

00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:05.556 A:middle
data to the verify receipt

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:06.946 A:middle
endpoint the verify receipt

00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:08.406 A:middle
endpoint will respond with JSON

00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:10.546 A:middle
payload that looks a little like

00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:11.596 A:middle
this.

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:13.336 A:middle
The first thing to check when

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:14.326 A:middle
you're verifying that this

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:15.666 A:middle
transaction is authentic is this

00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:16.476 A:middle
status field.

00:08:17.236 --> 00:08:18.476 A:middle
This is an indication that Apple

00:08:18.476 --> 00:08:19.706 A:middle
has actually issued this

00:08:19.706 --> 00:08:20.876 A:middle
document in the first place.

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:22.886 A:middle
Once you've verified that the

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:24.486 A:middle
status is zero like this you can

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:25.346 A:middle
check the contents of the

00:08:25.346 --> 00:08:27.676 A:middle
receipt portion of this payload.

00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:29.236 A:middle
This is the decoded version of

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:30.496 A:middle
that binary data that you just

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:32.385 A:middle
sent to verify receipt endpoint.

00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:33.645 A:middle
So in here you can do things

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:35.336 A:middle
like verify that the bundle ID

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:37.426 A:middle
in this receipt matches your

00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:38.246 A:middle
app's bundle ID.

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:40.446 A:middle
And then you can inspect the

00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:42.326 A:middle
in-app array, this contains a

00:08:42.326 --> 00:08:43.556 A:middle
list of transactions for this

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:45.156 A:middle
particular user for your app.

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:46.596 A:middle
And you can verify that the

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:49.356 A:middle
product ID associated with this

00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:50.846 A:middle
receipt is the one associated

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:51.296 A:middle
with your app.

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:53.886 A:middle
So assuming that these all match

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:55.856 A:middle
you're determining that this

00:08:55.856 --> 00:08:57.326 A:middle
receipt entitles this particular

00:08:57.326 --> 00:08:58.676 A:middle
user to your subscription

00:08:58.676 --> 00:08:59.986 A:middle
product you're ready to go ahead

00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:01.096 A:middle
now with that third step,
