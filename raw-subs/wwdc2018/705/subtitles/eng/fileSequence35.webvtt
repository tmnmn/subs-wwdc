00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:01.386 A:middle
update your user tables on your

00:35:01.386 --> 00:35:03.676 A:middle
database or on your server and

00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:04.876 A:middle
segment that customer as a

00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:06.716 A:middle
potential voluntary churning

00:35:06.766 --> 00:35:07.146 A:middle
customer.

00:35:07.716 --> 00:35:11.096 A:middle
If we go back to the example

00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.816 A:middle
subscription we've status

00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:15.426 A:middle
polled, we've captured this

00:35:15.476 --> 00:35:16.976 A:middle
customer might leave, so what

00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:17.476 A:middle
should we do?

00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:19.926 A:middle
As a developer this is your

00:35:19.926 --> 00:35:21.196 A:middle
opportunity to present an

00:35:21.196 --> 00:35:22.646 A:middle
attractive downgrade offer

00:35:22.646 --> 00:35:23.666 A:middle
potentially in the same

00:35:23.666 --> 00:35:24.686 A:middle
subscription group.

00:35:25.536 --> 00:35:27.476 A:middle
Here we can see Peak trying to

00:35:27.646 --> 00:35:29.006 A:middle
save that user by potentially

00:35:29.006 --> 00:35:30.756 A:middle
having them take a lesser term

00:35:30.756 --> 00:35:32.606 A:middle
or a lesser price subscription

00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:34.286 A:middle
of a different duration or maybe

00:35:34.286 --> 00:35:35.056 A:middle
a different offering.

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:39.806 A:middle
If that subscriber decides to

00:35:39.806 --> 00:35:41.616 A:middle
engage with this the same way

00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:42.676 A:middle
that Pete showed you by

00:35:42.746 --> 00:35:43.766 A:middle
surfacing upgrades and

00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:44.626 A:middle
downgrades within your

00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:47.036 A:middle
applications we want to let you

00:35:47.036 --> 00:35:48.946 A:middle
know what product they will

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:50.326 A:middle
renew on in the subsequent

00:35:50.326 --> 00:35:50.636 A:middle
period.

00:35:51.256 --> 00:35:54.266 A:middle
We do this via the auto renew

00:35:54.306 --> 00:35:55.906 A:middle
product ID field in the JSON

00:35:55.906 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
response.

00:35:57.236 --> 00:35:58.996 A:middle
So this differs from product ID

00:35:59.096 --> 00:36:00.696 A:middle
in that this is what the next
