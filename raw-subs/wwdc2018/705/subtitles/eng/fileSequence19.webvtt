00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:01.116 A:middle
immediately be unlocked since

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:02.886 A:middle
your server received that push

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:05.716 A:middle
straight from the App Store.

00:19:05.956 --> 00:19:07.416 A:middle
It's really important to unlock

00:19:07.416 --> 00:19:09.076 A:middle
users in a speedy manner when

00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:09.866 A:middle
this sort of thing happens,

00:19:09.866 --> 00:19:10.916 A:middle
especially when they go to all

00:19:10.916 --> 00:19:12.066 A:middle
that effort for updating their

00:19:12.066 --> 00:19:13.866 A:middle
credit card info manually and

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:14.846 A:middle
waiting for access to the

00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:15.326 A:middle
servers.

00:19:15.626 --> 00:19:16.436 A:middle
But there's one thing to note

00:19:16.436 --> 00:19:17.656 A:middle
here and that's the notification

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.386 A:middle
is only sent if the subscription

00:19:19.386 --> 00:19:20.846 A:middle
actually lapsed like we just

00:19:20.846 --> 00:19:21.166 A:middle
saw.

00:19:22.026 --> 00:19:23.476 A:middle
To discover successful renewal

00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:24.936 A:middle
transactions you still need to

00:19:24.936 --> 00:19:26.036 A:middle
rely on status polling

00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:27.256 A:middle
techniques we just outlined

00:19:27.256 --> 00:19:27.626 A:middle
before.

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:30.016 A:middle
But it's really easy to set up

00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:30.926 A:middle
to use server-to-server

00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:31.646 A:middle
notifications.

00:19:31.876 --> 00:19:34.096 A:middle
All you do is enter a URL in App

00:19:34.096 --> 00:19:34.506 A:middle
Store Connect.

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:36.426 A:middle
This is just an endpoint on your

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.146 A:middle
own server and if you enter it

00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:39.746 A:middle
into App Store Connect the App

00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:40.736 A:middle
Store will begin to send your

00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:42.936 A:middle
server HTTPS posts for these

00:19:43.026 --> 00:19:44.056 A:middle
status change events.

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:45.926 A:middle
And as we saw included in the

00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:47.336 A:middle
post is that latest transaction

00:19:47.376 --> 00:19:49.276 A:middle
info for the transaction that

00:19:49.276 --> 00:19:49.566 A:middle
triggered it.

00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:51.866 A:middle
You do make sure your server is

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:53.896 A:middle
ATS in order to receive these,

00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:55.186 A:middle
but it's a really simple step

00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:56.656 A:middle
that you can do to give a bunch

00:19:56.656 --> 00:19:57.526 A:middle
of users a much better

00:19:57.526 --> 00:19:57.976 A:middle
experience.
