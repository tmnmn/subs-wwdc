00:10:59.946 --> 00:11:00.106 A:middle
ID.

00:11:01.256 --> 00:11:02.206 A:middle
And it's important because it

00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:03.436 A:middle
shows up in all subsequent

00:11:03.436 --> 00:11:04.786 A:middle
renewal transactions.

00:11:05.136 --> 00:11:06.456 A:middle
Let's take a look at how this

00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:06.796 A:middle
works.

00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:07.746 A:middle
So let's say that you're

00:11:07.746 --> 00:11:09.366 A:middle
verifying a renewal transaction,

00:11:09.676 --> 00:11:10.646 A:middle
this happens in just the same

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:11.466 A:middle
way you might use the same

00:11:11.466 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
process transaction endpoint on

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:13.546 A:middle
your own server.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.236 A:middle
When you do those techniques of

00:11:16.236 --> 00:11:18.186 A:middle
verifying the transactions a

00:11:18.186 --> 00:11:19.736 A:middle
valid one, and you get up to

00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:20.806 A:middle
that stage of updating the

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:22.766 A:middle
user's subscription state you'll

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:23.686 A:middle
observe here that there's now

00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:25.216 A:middle
multiple transactions since this

00:11:25.216 --> 00:11:26.556 A:middle
is a renewal transaction.

00:11:27.976 --> 00:11:29.766 A:middle
Now according to your existing

00:11:29.766 --> 00:11:31.576 A:middle
server-side logic this latest

00:11:31.576 --> 00:11:32.836 A:middle
expires date is now a date in

00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:34.296 A:middle
the past, so the user is not

00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:35.516 A:middle
currently a subscriber and you

00:11:35.516 --> 00:11:36.726 A:middle
need to figure out are they

00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:38.306 A:middle
still a subscriber based on the

00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:39.206 A:middle
data in this receipt.

00:11:40.126 --> 00:11:41.926 A:middle
So how can you use this receipt

00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:43.656 A:middle
data and make that deduction?

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:46.026 A:middle
Well for discovering whether or

00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:47.176 A:middle
not the user has an active

00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:48.366 A:middle
subscription you can pull out

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:50.406 A:middle
the transactions associated with

00:11:50.406 --> 00:11:52.106 A:middle
that original transaction ID.

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:54.536 A:middle
And then you can find the

00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:55.776 A:middle
transaction that has the latest

00:11:55.806 --> 00:11:56.606 A:middle
expires date.

00:11:57.226 --> 00:11:58.476 A:middle
Now if you find a date in the

00:11:58.476 --> 00:12:00.226 A:middle
past that's an indication that
