00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:04.276 A:middle
So those are some tips and

00:20:04.276 --> 00:20:05.606 A:middle
tricks around how to build your

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:07.086 A:middle
app and server architecture.

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:08.666 A:middle
Let's talk about three tips that

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:09.926 A:middle
you can use in your in-app

00:20:09.926 --> 00:20:11.526 A:middle
experience to really enhance the

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:12.456 A:middle
user's experience.

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:14.906 A:middle
Firstly, we made the assumption

00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:16.726 A:middle
earlier that the user was signed

00:20:16.726 --> 00:20:17.946 A:middle
in to an account on your own

00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:18.556 A:middle
service.

00:20:19.776 --> 00:20:21.666 A:middle
In order to keep track of each

00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:22.896 A:middle
subscription ID you need this

00:20:22.936 --> 00:20:24.736 A:middle
particular user table located on

00:20:24.736 --> 00:20:25.146 A:middle
your server.

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:26.646 A:middle
Now when it comes to actually

00:20:26.646 --> 00:20:28.156 A:middle
creating accounts we think it's

00:20:28.196 --> 00:20:29.696 A:middle
best to offer in-app purchase

00:20:29.886 --> 00:20:31.606 A:middle
before an account creation step.

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:33.156 A:middle
Why is that?

00:20:33.156 --> 00:20:34.576 A:middle
Well as the user it's a much

00:20:34.576 --> 00:20:35.576 A:middle
better experience, you can just

00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:36.996 A:middle
open the app for the first time

00:20:36.996 --> 00:20:38.256 A:middle
and buy the subscription

00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:39.326 A:middle
immediately getting access to

00:20:39.326 --> 00:20:40.106 A:middle
the content you're after.

00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:41.746 A:middle
For you it's better because you

00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:43.056 A:middle
get higher conversion rates,

00:20:43.296 --> 00:20:44.196 A:middle
users don't have to go through

00:20:44.236 --> 00:20:45.726 A:middle
funnels of entering emails and

00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:47.086 A:middle
passwords to be able to get

00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:48.066 A:middle
access to giving you money.

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:50.396 A:middle
Now you can use the techniques

00:20:50.426 --> 00:20:51.836 A:middle
that we just went through by

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.406 A:middle
using an anonymous account in

00:20:53.406 --> 00:20:54.116 A:middle
these instances.

00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:58.156 A:middle
And you can rely on the original

00:20:58.156 --> 00:20:59.636 A:middle
transaction ID if you need to

00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:01.206 A:middle
associate multiple devices.
