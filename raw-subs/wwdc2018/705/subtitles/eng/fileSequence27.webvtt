00:27:03.046 --> 00:27:04.276 A:middle
Now if we look at how our tuning

00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:05.876 A:middle
has impacted the recovery of

00:27:05.876 --> 00:27:07.966 A:middle
subscriptions we can see that

00:27:08.006 --> 00:27:09.636 A:middle
quarter over quarter we've been

00:27:09.636 --> 00:27:11.416 A:middle
able to continue to recover more

00:27:11.416 --> 00:27:13.146 A:middle
and more of your subscriptions.

00:27:13.706 --> 00:27:17.456 A:middle
Now the net result of this has

00:27:17.456 --> 00:27:19.766 A:middle
been 12 million of your

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:21.076 A:middle
subscriptions recovered since

00:27:21.116 --> 00:27:21.966 A:middle
the launch of Billing Retry.

00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:28.436 A:middle
So that's what Apple's doing to

00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:29.756 A:middle
minimize involuntary churn for

00:27:29.756 --> 00:27:29.986 A:middle
you.

00:27:30.846 --> 00:27:31.986 A:middle
But there's also some tactics

00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:33.526 A:middle
that you as a developer can do

00:27:33.606 --> 00:27:35.046 A:middle
to minimize voluntary churn

00:27:35.366 --> 00:27:36.636 A:middle
inside of your subscription

00:27:36.636 --> 00:27:37.216 A:middle
applications.

00:27:38.386 --> 00:27:39.626 A:middle
You can leverage some of the

00:27:39.686 --> 00:27:41.136 A:middle
subscription specific receipt

00:27:41.176 --> 00:27:42.236 A:middle
fields that Pete mentioned

00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:42.596 A:middle
earlier.

00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:44.926 A:middle
You can implement grace periods

00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:47.436 A:middle
and during that time you can

00:27:47.586 --> 00:27:49.236 A:middle
deploy some effective customer

00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:49.716 A:middle
messaging.

00:27:51.106 --> 00:27:52.216 A:middle
So let's take a look at an

00:27:52.216 --> 00:27:53.226 A:middle
example subscription.

00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:55.656 A:middle
Here we can see that our

00:27:55.656 --> 00:27:57.406 A:middle
subscriber was set to renew on

00:27:57.406 --> 00:28:00.206 A:middle
April 26th, however, they
