00:29:00.876 --> 00:29:02.116 A:middle
If we flip back to our example

00:29:02.116 --> 00:29:04.076 A:middle
subscription you can see that

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:05.206 A:middle
our subscriber is in a billing

00:29:05.206 --> 00:29:06.956 A:middle
retry state and was set to renew

00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:08.026 A:middle
on April 26th.

00:29:09.246 --> 00:29:10.576 A:middle
Here we want to add some

00:29:10.646 --> 00:29:12.036 A:middle
server-side logic to use that

00:29:12.036 --> 00:29:14.296 A:middle
expires date field and the is in

00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:16.446 A:middle
billing retry period in order to

00:29:16.446 --> 00:29:18.026 A:middle
add a period of time, in this

00:29:18.026 --> 00:29:20.326 A:middle
example three days where that

00:29:20.326 --> 00:29:21.516 A:middle
user will continue to have

00:29:21.516 --> 00:29:23.086 A:middle
access to the service and

00:29:23.086 --> 00:29:25.346 A:middle
technically stay subscribed.

00:29:26.796 --> 00:29:27.966 A:middle
Now why would you do this?

00:29:28.436 --> 00:29:30.666 A:middle
Well it's an opportune time to

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:32.236 A:middle
deploy some effective customer

00:29:32.236 --> 00:29:33.986 A:middle
messaging to contextually

00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:34.866 A:middle
communicate with your

00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:36.626 A:middle
subscribers and let them know

00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:37.956 A:middle
that there may be an issue with

00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:38.716 A:middle
their subscription.

00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:41.016 A:middle
You may want to do things like

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:42.856 A:middle
ask them to update their payment

00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:45.336 A:middle
method or have them restate the

00:29:45.336 --> 00:29:46.526 A:middle
value proposition of the

00:29:46.526 --> 00:29:47.646 A:middle
subscription offering that

00:29:47.646 --> 00:29:48.456 A:middle
they're subscribed to.

00:29:49.336 --> 00:29:50.826 A:middle
And during this time you can

00:29:50.826 --> 00:29:52.376 A:middle
offer limited service as well,

00:29:52.676 --> 00:29:54.166 A:middle
such as a browse but not watch

00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:55.606 A:middle
experience in an entertainment

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:56.326 A:middle
app.

00:29:57.956 --> 00:29:59.446 A:middle
Here we can see Peak, a

00:29:59.496 --> 00:30:00.586 A:middle
