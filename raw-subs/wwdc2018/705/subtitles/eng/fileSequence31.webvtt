00:30:59.876 --> 00:31:01.536 A:middle
within the first seven days of

00:31:01.536 --> 00:31:03.016 A:middle
entering a Billing Retry state

00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:03.656 A:middle
on the platform.

00:31:03.656 --> 00:31:07.406 A:middle
This might be a time to offer a

00:31:07.406 --> 00:31:09.466 A:middle
full access grace period because

00:31:09.466 --> 00:31:10.416 A:middle
we see a lot of users

00:31:10.516 --> 00:31:12.626 A:middle
self-recovering during this

00:31:13.696 --> 00:31:13.806 A:middle
time.

00:31:14.026 --> 00:31:15.176 A:middle
You may want to deploy that

00:31:15.176 --> 00:31:16.496 A:middle
customer messaging towards the

00:31:16.496 --> 00:31:18.006 A:middle
tail end of this to bring in

00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:19.066 A:middle
some of those subscribers that

00:31:19.066 --> 00:31:20.196 A:middle
might've taken longer to come

00:31:20.196 --> 00:31:20.976 A:middle
back into your application.

00:31:25.156 --> 00:31:26.406 A:middle
Let's flip back to our example

00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:26.916 A:middle
subscription.

00:31:27.356 --> 00:31:28.756 A:middle
What happens if this is

00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:30.016 A:middle
effective and we're able to

00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:31.096 A:middle
recover these customers?

00:31:31.606 --> 00:31:34.236 A:middle
When a retry attempt is

00:31:34.236 --> 00:31:36.726 A:middle
successful the date of the retry

00:31:36.726 --> 00:31:38.276 A:middle
or recovery becomes the new

00:31:38.276 --> 00:31:39.646 A:middle
subscription anniversary date

00:31:39.646 --> 00:31:41.306 A:middle
moving forward and this will be

00:31:41.306 --> 00:31:43.196 A:middle
reflected in JSON response when

00:31:43.196 --> 00:31:44.376 A:middle
validating that successful

00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:46.466 A:middle
transaction and finishing it.

00:31:47.676 --> 00:31:48.846 A:middle
But we're not going to stop

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:50.756 A:middle
there we're also going to deploy

00:31:50.756 --> 00:31:51.646 A:middle
our server-to-server

00:31:51.646 --> 00:31:53.266 A:middle
notifications so that you can

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:55.226 A:middle
immediately unlock access on all

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:57.206 A:middle
platforms and close the loop

00:31:57.206 --> 00:31:58.566 A:middle
with your customer letting them

00:31:58.566 --> 00:32:00.116 A:middle
know hey you're all set.
