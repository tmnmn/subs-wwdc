00:13:00.566 --> 00:13:01.456 A:middle
The App Store is charging the

00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:02.276 A:middle
user's credit card in the

00:13:02.276 --> 00:13:03.626 A:middle
background and you're using

00:13:03.626 --> 00:13:05.046 A:middle
StoreKit to process these

00:13:05.046 --> 00:13:06.436 A:middle
transactions as they come in

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:07.306 A:middle
through the app.

00:13:07.306 --> 00:13:09.086 A:middle
And then your server is updating

00:13:09.086 --> 00:13:10.566 A:middle
and maintaining this latest

00:13:10.566 --> 00:13:12.106 A:middle
expires date field on your

00:13:12.106 --> 00:13:12.436 A:middle
server.

00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:13.706 A:middle
So you've got that server-side

00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:15.176 A:middle
source of truth as to whether or

00:13:15.176 --> 00:13:16.466 A:middle
not a user is subscribed.

00:13:17.746 --> 00:13:18.906 A:middle
Let's now introduce a slightly

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:20.056 A:middle
more complex example though to

00:13:20.056 --> 00:13:21.236 A:middle
the mix, which is maybe that you

00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:22.236 A:middle
offer your service through a

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:23.196 A:middle
website as well.

00:13:24.276 --> 00:13:25.956 A:middle
Now when the user accesses your

00:13:25.956 --> 00:13:26.956 A:middle
subscription service through a

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:29.006 A:middle
website you know based on that

00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:30.156 A:middle
latest expires date field that

00:13:30.156 --> 00:13:31.216 A:middle
the user is a subscriber.

00:13:32.606 --> 00:13:34.006 A:middle
But as much as we'd like to

00:13:34.076 --> 00:13:35.296 A:middle
think that people use our apps

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:37.296 A:middle
all the time let's say that the

00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:38.266 A:middle
user doesn't use your app for a

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:39.006 A:middle
number of days.

00:13:39.546 --> 00:13:40.426 A:middle
And then during this time the

00:13:40.426 --> 00:13:41.606 A:middle
App Store actually successfully

00:13:41.606 --> 00:13:43.696 A:middle
renews a user's subscription in

00:13:43.696 --> 00:13:44.226 A:middle
the background.

00:13:45.226 --> 00:13:46.526 A:middle
When the user tries to access

00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:47.496 A:middle
your servers through your

00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:49.716 A:middle
website that latest expires date

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:50.776 A:middle
is now out of date because your

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:52.036 A:middle
server hasn't learned about that

00:13:52.036 --> 00:13:52.756 A:middle
new transaction.

00:13:52.826 --> 00:13:54.606 A:middle
So how can your server know

00:13:54.606 --> 00:13:56.036 A:middle
about this transaction that's

00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:59.926 A:middle
occurred on the App Store?
