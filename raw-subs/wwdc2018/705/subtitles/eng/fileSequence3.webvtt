00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:01.296 A:middle
You receive transactions on a

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:02.466 A:middle
callback in the Transaction

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:03.056 A:middle
Observed called

00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:05.316 A:middle
updatedTransactions and it's

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:06.976 A:middle
here that StoreKit will inform

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:08.196 A:middle
your app of a set of

00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:09.706 A:middle
transactions for you to process.

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:11.126 A:middle
They can come in various

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:11.986 A:middle
different states that we're not

00:03:11.986 --> 00:03:13.106 A:middle
going to go completely into in

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:14.556 A:middle
this talk, but keep an eye out

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:15.606 A:middle
for a transaction in the

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:16.546 A:middle
purchased state.

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:18.126 A:middle
That's a transaction that

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:19.996 A:middle
StoreKit is telling your app is

00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:21.436 A:middle
ready for verification and

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:21.766 A:middle
unlocking.

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:25.726 A:middle
Once you've got a transaction

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:26.606 A:middle
the purchase state you're ready

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.826 A:middle
to go with that next step, which

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:29.356 A:middle
is to verify that it is an

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:30.366 A:middle
authentic transaction.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:33.826 A:middle
So when it comes to checking for

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:34.936 A:middle
authenticity how can you know

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:36.086 A:middle
that money really has changed

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:37.176 A:middle
hands?

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:38.826 A:middle
You use a thing called the App

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:39.396 A:middle
Store receipt.

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:41.446 A:middle
The App Store receipt is just

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:42.716 A:middle
like a receipt you'd get in a

00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:43.896 A:middle
department store, it's a proof

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:45.066 A:middle
of purchase that a user has

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:46.436 A:middle
bought something that they say

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:46.836 A:middle
they've bought.

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:48.726 A:middle
In this case it's a trusted

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:50.146 A:middle
record of the initial app

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.266 A:middle
download and any in-app

00:03:51.346 --> 00:03:52.796 A:middle
purchases that have occurred for

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:53.166 A:middle
this app.

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:55.706 A:middle
This is a digital document, it's

00:03:55.706 --> 00:03:57.286 A:middle
stored on the user's device, we

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:58.756 A:middle
provide an API for you to access

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.576 A:middle
it and it's put there by the App
