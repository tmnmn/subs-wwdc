00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:02.496 A:middle
But once you've saved these two

00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:04.036 A:middle
bits of information against this

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:05.136 A:middle
current user on your server

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:06.146 A:middle
you're ready to go ahead with

00:10:06.146 --> 00:10:07.636 A:middle
the last step, which is to tell

00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:09.276 A:middle
the device that this transaction

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.066 A:middle
has actually passed your

00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:11.146 A:middle
verification checks.

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:13.016 A:middle
And then when your device gets

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.756 A:middle
this callback it can call Finish

00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:16.256 A:middle
Transaction back down in your

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:17.146 A:middle
Transaction Observer.

00:10:18.276 --> 00:10:19.456 A:middle
This is a really important step

00:10:19.456 --> 00:10:20.106 A:middle
because finishing the

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:21.146 A:middle
transactional will actually

00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:22.606 A:middle
clear it out of your payment

00:10:22.606 --> 00:10:22.866 A:middle
queue.

00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:23.816 A:middle
And if you don't call Finish

00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:25.626 A:middle
Transaction it might reappear

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:26.516 A:middle
there the next time the app

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:27.876 A:middle
launches for processing.

00:10:27.946 --> 00:10:28.886 A:middle
So make sure you finish every

00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:31.506 A:middle
transaction that begins in

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:32.756 A:middle
StoreKit.

00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:33.396 A:middle
Once you've finished the

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:35.136 A:middle
transaction you've got an

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:36.236 A:middle
updated subscription state in

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:37.226 A:middle
your server, the user is now

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:38.896 A:middle
free to enjoy that subscription

00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:40.136 A:middle
period on your service.

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:44.106 A:middle
Now let's take another look at

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:45.486 A:middle
that user table I mentioned that

00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:46.506 A:middle
you're storing on your server.

00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:48.966 A:middle
Each user who purchases a

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.396 A:middle
subscription using this setup

00:10:50.396 --> 00:10:51.556 A:middle
will be assigned a unique

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:53.286 A:middle
original transaction ID, that's

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.046 A:middle
that field that you saved from

00:10:55.046 --> 00:10:56.216 A:middle
the transaction response.

00:10:56.896 --> 00:10:58.186 A:middle
And this identifier essentially

00:10:58.186 --> 00:10:59.716 A:middle
becomes that user's subscription

00:10:59.946 --> 00:11:00.106 A:middle
ID.
