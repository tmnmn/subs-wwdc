00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:00.386 A:middle
this transaction that we're

00:07:00.426 --> 00:07:00.886 A:middle
processing.

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:02.956 A:middle
Back here in our Transaction

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.676 A:middle
Observer you can access that

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:05.946 A:middle
binary receipt data using the

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:08.486 A:middle
App Store receipt URL API on the

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:09.066 A:middle
main bundle.

00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:11.046 A:middle
Once you have this URL you can

00:07:11.136 --> 00:07:13.146 A:middle
pull out the binary data located

00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:14.976 A:middle
at that spot on the file system

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:16.286 A:middle
and you can pull out that

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:18.066 A:middle
receiptData and base64Encode and

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.406 A:middle
this will give you a nice string

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.576 A:middle
that you can send up to your own

00:07:20.576 --> 00:07:21.586 A:middle
server for processing.

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:23.386 A:middle
You might provide some in-app

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:25.156 A:middle
networking API for the current

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:25.986 A:middle
user.

00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:28.306 A:middle
When you're sending that data up

00:07:28.306 --> 00:07:29.486 A:middle
to your server for processing

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:30.866 A:middle
firstly you'll do this securely

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:31.296 A:middle
obviously.

00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:32.616 A:middle
You can send it up to maybe a

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:34.146 A:middle
process transaction endpoint on

00:07:34.146 --> 00:07:34.586 A:middle
your server.

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:36.816 A:middle
In this endpoint you might have

00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:38.546 A:middle
a user ID associated with the

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.166 A:middle
current user for an account on

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:40.736 A:middle
your own system.

00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:42.946 A:middle
You can send this receipt data

00:07:42.946 --> 00:07:44.566 A:middle
up to your server and then once

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:45.566 A:middle
you get that on your server you

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:46.506 A:middle
can establish a secure

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:47.896 A:middle
connection to the App Store's

00:07:47.896 --> 00:07:49.526 A:middle
verify receipt endpoint.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.376 A:middle
And you can send over that

00:07:51.376 --> 00:07:52.856 A:middle
receipt data to the App Store.

00:07:52.856 --> 00:07:55.546 A:middle
Here you can include a password

00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:56.666 A:middle
field, this is just a shared

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:58.526 A:middle
secret between your app and the

00:07:58.526 --> 00:07:59.006 A:middle
App Store.

00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:00.176 A:middle
You can set this up in App Store
