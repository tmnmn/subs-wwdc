not watch experience in an

00:40:00.536 --> 00:40:00.976 A:middle
entertainment app.

00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:04.956 A:middle
Here we can see Tinder, when

00:40:04.956 --> 00:40:07.176 A:middle
users interact with pro level or

00:40:07.176 --> 00:40:08.816 A:middle
subscription level features they

00:40:08.816 --> 00:40:10.476 A:middle
are continually prompted to

00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:11.746 A:middle
subscribe.

00:40:12.616 --> 00:40:14.656 A:middle
So in summary, if you take

00:40:14.656 --> 00:40:15.906 A:middle
anything away from this section

00:40:15.906 --> 00:40:17.136 A:middle
on reducing subscriber churn

00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:18.386 A:middle
it's that you should be

00:40:18.386 --> 00:40:19.896 A:middle
leveraging these subscription

00:40:19.896 --> 00:40:21.476 A:middle
receipt fields effectively.

00:40:22.016 --> 00:40:25.116 A:middle
You can then implement status

00:40:25.116 --> 00:40:26.646 A:middle
polling to understand when your

00:40:26.646 --> 00:40:27.776 A:middle
subscribers may voluntarily

00:40:27.776 --> 00:40:27.976 A:middle
churn.

00:40:32.546 --> 00:40:33.606 A:middle
You can then use that status

00:40:33.676 --> 00:40:35.196 A:middle
polling to deploy some targeted

00:40:35.196 --> 00:40:36.106 A:middle
and effective customer

00:40:36.106 --> 00:40:36.676 A:middle
messaging.

00:40:37.266 --> 00:40:40.816 A:middle
And then to close it out,

00:40:40.976 --> 00:40:42.116 A:middle
presenting contextual

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:43.316 A:middle
subscription offers to these

00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:45.106 A:middle
users to hopefully win them back

00:40:45.386 --> 00:40:46.536 A:middle
or prevent them from churning in

00:40:46.536 --> 00:40:47.666 A:middle
the first place.

00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:50.586 A:middle
So with that I'd like to hand it

00:40:50.586 --> 00:40:51.696 A:middle
back to my colleague Pete to

00:40:51.696 --> 00:40:53.026 A:middle
discuss analytics and reporting.

00:40:53.396 --> 00:40:53.696 A:middle
Thank you.
