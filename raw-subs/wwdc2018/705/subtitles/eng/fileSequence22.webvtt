00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.356 A:middle
The is trial period field and

00:22:01.516 --> 00:22:03.466 A:middle
the is in intro offer period

00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:03.976 A:middle
field.

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:05.826 A:middle
If either of these fields are

00:22:05.826 --> 00:22:07.556 A:middle
true that's an indication that

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:09.446 A:middle
an introductory offer or a free

00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:10.576 A:middle
trial was used for this

00:22:10.616 --> 00:22:11.626 A:middle
particular transaction.

00:22:12.536 --> 00:22:13.686 A:middle
And if it was you should keep

00:22:13.686 --> 00:22:15.506 A:middle
track of the product ID in

00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:17.436 A:middle
question against this current

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:17.646 A:middle
user.

00:22:17.646 --> 00:22:18.806 A:middle
You might store them in a field

00:22:18.806 --> 00:22:20.566 A:middle
called consumedProductDiscounts.

00:22:21.676 --> 00:22:23.106 A:middle
Now if you're keeping track of

00:22:23.106 --> 00:22:24.756 A:middle
which products were used with

00:22:24.756 --> 00:22:26.216 A:middle
introductory offers, when it

00:22:26.216 --> 00:22:27.856 A:middle
comes time to render the price

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
of some new subscription product

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:30.986 A:middle
that you want to show your user

00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:32.816 A:middle
this is how you can do it.

00:22:33.136 --> 00:22:34.266 A:middle
You can take those consumed

00:22:34.316 --> 00:22:36.156 A:middle
product discounts saved against

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:38.136 A:middle
the current user and execute an

00:22:38.136 --> 00:22:39.426 A:middle
SKProductsRequest with them.

00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:41.046 A:middle
And the reason why is that the

00:22:41.096 --> 00:22:42.676 A:middle
response from SKProductRequest

00:22:42.676 --> 00:22:44.386 A:middle
now in iOS 12 includes the

00:22:44.386 --> 00:22:46.476 A:middle
subscription group identifier so

00:22:46.476 --> 00:22:47.536 A:middle
you know which subscription

00:22:47.536 --> 00:22:48.866 A:middle
group this particular product is

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:49.136 A:middle
from.

00:22:49.986 --> 00:22:51.406 A:middle
And now armed with this

00:22:51.406 --> 00:22:52.586 A:middle
subscription group identifier

00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:54.096 A:middle
you can keep track of that in a

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:56.516 A:middle
set of consumed group discounts

00:22:56.676 --> 00:22:57.556 A:middle
for this particular user.

00:22:57.826 --> 00:22:59.016 A:middle
So you know which subscription

00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:01.056 A:middle
groups this user has used offers
