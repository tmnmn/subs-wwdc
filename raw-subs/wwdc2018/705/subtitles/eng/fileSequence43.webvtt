00:42:59.976 --> 00:43:01.696 A:middle
Store receipts are useful for

00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:02.856 A:middle
validating those StoreKit

00:43:02.856 --> 00:43:04.416 A:middle
transactions and updating user

00:43:04.416 --> 00:43:05.856 A:middle
subscription states, maintaining

00:43:05.856 --> 00:43:06.706 A:middle
the state on your server.

00:43:07.396 --> 00:43:08.426 A:middle
And you can also use them to

00:43:08.426 --> 00:43:10.206 A:middle
understand individual subscriber

00:43:10.206 --> 00:43:11.266 A:middle
behavior just like Michael

00:43:11.266 --> 00:43:11.696 A:middle
showed you.

00:43:11.696 --> 00:43:14.576 A:middle
For App Store Connect reports

00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:15.846 A:middle
it's for a slightly different

00:43:15.846 --> 00:43:16.606 A:middle
reason, they're better at that

00:43:16.606 --> 00:43:18.626 A:middle
macrolevel analysis, maybe

00:43:18.626 --> 00:43:19.746 A:middle
understanding subscription

00:43:19.746 --> 00:43:21.516 A:middle
pathways of users of your app

00:43:21.516 --> 00:43:23.046 A:middle
and maybe most importantly,

00:43:23.046 --> 00:43:24.366 A:middle
understanding how much money is

00:43:24.366 --> 00:43:25.496 A:middle
going to get deposited into your

00:43:25.496 --> 00:43:26.616 A:middle
bank account for your

00:43:26.616 --> 00:43:27.356 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:43:27.926 --> 00:43:30.586 A:middle
Now we've covered a lot of

00:43:30.586 --> 00:43:32.086 A:middle
topics here today, but as a bit

00:43:32.086 --> 00:43:33.606 A:middle
of a summary remember that

00:43:33.606 --> 00:43:35.016 A:middle
server-side state management

00:43:35.016 --> 00:43:36.836 A:middle
offers you much more flexibility

00:43:37.236 --> 00:43:38.476 A:middle
when it comes to managing

00:43:38.476 --> 00:43:39.266 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:43:40.746 --> 00:43:42.116 A:middle
If you haven't done it yet add

00:43:42.116 --> 00:43:43.396 A:middle
that URL to receive

00:43:43.396 --> 00:43:44.576 A:middle
notifications from the App

00:43:44.576 --> 00:43:44.886 A:middle
Store.

00:43:46.386 --> 00:43:47.136 A:middle
Consider offering an

00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:48.316 A:middle
introductory price in your app,

00:43:48.316 --> 00:43:49.596 A:middle
it's a great way to get users in

00:43:49.596 --> 00:43:50.536 A:middle
the door to your own

00:43:50.536 --> 00:43:51.166 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:54.186 A:middle
Add some simple messaging to

00:43:54.186 --> 00:43:55.766 A:middle
reduce subscriber churn, using

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:56.906 A:middle
those fields that Michael walked

00:43:56.906 --> 00:43:57.296 A:middle
us through.

00:43:57.876 --> 00:43:59.556 A:middle
And for users that have actually

00:43:59.556 --> 00:44:01.756 A:middle
lapsed offer some alternative
