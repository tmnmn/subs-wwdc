00:35:59.096 --> 00:36:00.696 A:middle
in that this is what the next

00:36:00.696 --> 00:36:02.256 A:middle
offering will be after that

00:36:02.296 --> 00:36:03.116 A:middle
subscriber renews.

00:36:03.276 --> 00:36:07.546 A:middle
Here we can see in the example

00:36:07.546 --> 00:36:09.986 A:middle
subscription our subscriber has

00:36:09.986 --> 00:36:11.276 A:middle
elected to downgrade instead of

00:36:11.276 --> 00:36:11.706 A:middle
churn out.

00:36:12.956 --> 00:36:13.966 A:middle
We've changed the auto renew

00:36:13.966 --> 00:36:16.566 A:middle
status to one and we've added

00:36:16.566 --> 00:36:18.406 A:middle
auto renew product ID.

00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:21.276 A:middle
It would also be beneficial to

00:36:21.276 --> 00:36:22.346 A:middle
be notified of this change

00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:24.976 A:middle
immediately, so for this we'll

00:36:24.976 --> 00:36:26.316 A:middle
also send a server-to-server

00:36:26.316 --> 00:36:27.896 A:middle
notification letting you know

00:36:27.996 --> 00:36:30.296 A:middle
that your subscriber did change

00:36:30.296 --> 00:36:31.176 A:middle
their renewal preference.

00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:34.846 A:middle
This is useful if you want to

00:36:34.846 --> 00:36:36.366 A:middle
maybe state the differing

00:36:36.456 --> 00:36:38.156 A:middle
service levels between what

00:36:38.156 --> 00:36:39.406 A:middle
they're currently subscribed to

00:36:39.646 --> 00:36:40.686 A:middle
and what they will have in the

00:36:40.686 --> 00:36:41.516 A:middle
subsequent period.

00:36:42.126 --> 00:36:46.016 A:middle
Now it's impossible to run a

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:47.946 A:middle
100% retention subscription

00:36:47.946 --> 00:36:49.736 A:middle
business, so it's important to

00:36:49.736 --> 00:36:50.586 A:middle
understand how you could

00:36:50.646 --> 00:36:52.786 A:middle
possibly win back some of those

00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:54.416 A:middle
subscribers that you might have

00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:54.806 A:middle
lost.

00:36:56.416 --> 00:36:58.226 A:middle
A win back is reengaging

00:36:58.276 --> 00:36:59.506 A:middle
subscribers after they've

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:01.236 A:middle
churned by showing them
