00:32:59.336 --> 00:33:00.606 A:middle
reasons that you still need to

00:33:00.706 --> 00:33:01.906 A:middle
status poll.

00:33:02.936 --> 00:33:05.396 A:middle
The first is understanding will

00:33:05.396 --> 00:33:07.076 A:middle
my subscriber churn in the

00:33:07.076 --> 00:33:08.556 A:middle
subsequent subscription period

00:33:09.576 --> 00:33:11.156 A:middle
and the second being has my

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:12.026 A:middle
subscriber renewed.

00:33:12.576 --> 00:33:16.276 A:middle
We often get asked when should I

00:33:16.276 --> 00:33:17.736 A:middle
status poll as a developer, when

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:18.776 A:middle
should I try to catch those

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:20.896 A:middle
users and see their subscription

00:33:20.896 --> 00:33:21.526 A:middle
state changes.

00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:24.966 A:middle
The most effective times that we

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:27.066 A:middle
see are doing that status poll

00:33:27.066 --> 00:33:28.416 A:middle
at the beginning or end of a

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:29.346 A:middle
subscription period.

00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:31.646 A:middle
By deploying this responsibly

00:33:32.396 --> 00:33:33.316 A:middle
you're most likely going to

00:33:33.346 --> 00:33:35.656 A:middle
catch most users that may want

00:33:35.656 --> 00:33:37.016 A:middle
to voluntarily churn from your

00:33:37.016 --> 00:33:37.836 A:middle
subscription offering.

00:33:40.596 --> 00:33:42.256 A:middle
But when you status poll you'll

00:33:42.256 --> 00:33:43.456 A:middle
also get access to some

00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:45.086 A:middle
additional subscriber status

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:45.406 A:middle
fields.

00:33:45.886 --> 00:33:47.906 A:middle
And you may want to take those

00:33:47.906 --> 00:33:49.886 A:middle
fields and save the decoded JSON

00:33:49.886 --> 00:33:51.316 A:middle
response from the verify receipt

00:33:51.346 --> 00:33:53.566 A:middle
call in the user tables on your

00:33:53.566 --> 00:33:54.086 A:middle
databases.

00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:57.146 A:middle
Or alternatively, you can parse

00:33:57.146 --> 00:33:59.456 A:middle
out specific fields such as the

00:33:59.456 --> 00:34:00.906 A:middle
