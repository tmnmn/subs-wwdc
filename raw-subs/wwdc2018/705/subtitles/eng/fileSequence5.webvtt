00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.196 A:middle
do those checks for you.

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:03.136 A:middle
You can use either of these

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.646 A:middle
techniques, but whichever one

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:05.816 A:middle
you choose it's important not to

00:05:05.816 --> 00:05:07.256 A:middle
use online validation directly

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:08.826 A:middle
from the user's device, this is

00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:10.076 A:middle
not a secure way of actually

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:11.656 A:middle
validating this document is

00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:12.096 A:middle
authentic.

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.256 A:middle
But let's compare each of these

00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:15.396 A:middle
two approaches in a little more

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:16.536 A:middle
detail, especially around

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:17.736 A:middle
subscription management and

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:19.166 A:middle
order renewable subscriptions.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:21.466 A:middle
Both of these techniques give

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.086 A:middle
you a way to validate that this

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:24.206 A:middle
is an authentic document.

00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:26.696 A:middle
They also give you access to the

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:27.766 A:middle
contents of the receipt, any

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:29.356 A:middle
transactions that have occurred

00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:30.416 A:middle
for this particular user.

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:32.306 A:middle
But when it comes to auto

00:05:32.306 --> 00:05:33.426 A:middle
renewable subscriptions there's

00:05:33.456 --> 00:05:34.716 A:middle
a few key advantages that

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:35.836 A:middle
server-to-server receipt

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.096 A:middle
validation actually gives you

00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:38.396 A:middle
over on-device receipt

00:05:38.396 --> 00:05:38.886 A:middle
validation.

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:40.496 A:middle
Firstly, we include some

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:41.686 A:middle
additional subscription

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.676 A:middle
information in the response to

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:44.976 A:middle
that validation check.

00:05:45.406 --> 00:05:46.786 A:middle
You can use this, Michael will

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:47.526 A:middle
talk about a little later in

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:47.886 A:middle
this talk.

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:51.126 A:middle
Your server is always on to

00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:51.906 A:middle
handle those renewal

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:53.206 A:middle
transactions in the background.

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.166 A:middle
This is really important if

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.476 A:middle
you've got a service with maybe

00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:56.416 A:middle
multiple platforms.

00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:59.676 A:middle
Your server is not susceptible

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
to a device clock change.
