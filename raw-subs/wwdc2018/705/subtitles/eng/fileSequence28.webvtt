00:27:57.406 --> 00:28:00.206 A:middle
April 26th, however, they

00:28:00.206 --> 00:28:01.266 A:middle
encountered a billing issue.

00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:04.196 A:middle
So in order to let you know that

00:28:04.196 --> 00:28:06.126 A:middle
Apple is actively attempting to

00:28:06.126 --> 00:28:07.756 A:middle
collect funds from that user via

00:28:07.756 --> 00:28:10.066 A:middle
the Billing Retry service we are

00:28:10.066 --> 00:28:11.166 A:middle
going to surface a field in the

00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:14.346 A:middle
JSON response aptly titled is in

00:28:14.346 --> 00:28:15.346 A:middle
billing retry period.

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:18.226 A:middle
A value of one signifying that

00:28:18.226 --> 00:28:19.316 A:middle
we're attempting to collect

00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:20.756 A:middle
funds for that subscriber.

00:28:21.436 --> 00:28:24.576 A:middle
If we go back to our example of

00:28:24.576 --> 00:28:25.836 A:middle
subscription you can see that

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.126 A:middle
this has been added to JSON

00:28:27.126 --> 00:28:27.576 A:middle
response.

00:28:27.576 --> 00:28:29.716 A:middle
And when you see this in

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:30.986 A:middle
conjunction with the expires

00:28:30.986 --> 00:28:32.946 A:middle
date this is your signal as a

00:28:32.946 --> 00:28:34.826 A:middle
developer to implement what we

00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:37.206 A:middle
call a grace period.

00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:38.416 A:middle
You may ask yourself what is a

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:38.976 A:middle
grace period.

00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:44.116 A:middle
A grace period is free

00:28:44.176 --> 00:28:46.016 A:middle
subscription access while in a

00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:47.756 A:middle
billing retry state, however

00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:49.456 A:middle
it's before you have lost that

00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:50.586 A:middle
subscriber, before they've

00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:51.386 A:middle
churned out.

00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:53.426 A:middle
The goal of the grace period is

00:28:53.426 --> 00:28:54.486 A:middle
to improve recovery.

00:28:54.486 --> 00:28:56.826 A:middle
So let's take a look at how we

00:28:56.826 --> 00:28:58.176 A:middle
can do that leveraging some of

00:28:58.176 --> 00:28:59.286 A:middle
the information in the receipt

00:28:59.286 --> 00:28:59.676 A:middle
response.
