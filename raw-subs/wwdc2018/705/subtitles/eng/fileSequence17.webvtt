00:16:59.346 --> 00:17:00.756 A:middle
unsubscribed involuntarily?

00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:01.936 A:middle
Not at all.

00:17:03.226 --> 00:17:04.445 A:middle
When reacting to billing issues

00:17:04.445 --> 00:17:05.606 A:middle
like this you can do three

00:17:05.685 --> 00:17:06.476 A:middle
simple steps.

00:17:06.476 --> 00:17:08.136 A:middle
Firstly, you can observe that

00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:09.296 A:middle
there's been no renewal

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:10.796 A:middle
transaction for this particular

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.455 A:middle
user, their subscription has now

00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:12.796 A:middle
lapsed.

00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:15.766 A:middle
Secondly, you can direct that

00:17:15.766 --> 00:17:17.256 A:middle
particular user to go and update

00:17:17.256 --> 00:17:18.546 A:middle
their billing info.

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.955 A:middle
And then the third step, when a

00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:23.546 A:middle
renewal transaction occurs

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.526 A:middle
unblock that user immediately

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:26.516 A:middle
after it happens.

00:17:27.286 --> 00:17:28.376 A:middle
Now, steps one and two are

00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:29.826 A:middle
pretty straightforward using the

00:17:29.826 --> 00:17:30.996 A:middle
status polling techniques that

00:17:30.996 --> 00:17:32.286 A:middle
we just went through, but step

00:17:32.286 --> 00:17:34.006 A:middle
number three here uses a feature

00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:35.086 A:middle
that we actually launched last

00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:36.566 A:middle
year server-to-server

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:37.406 A:middle
notifications.

00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:39.526 A:middle
Let's walk through this example,

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:40.976 A:middle
let's say that one subscription

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:42.496 A:middle
period the App Store has an

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:43.966 A:middle
error when trying to charge this

00:17:43.966 --> 00:17:44.696 A:middle
user's credit card.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.696 A:middle
And then you find out about the

00:17:47.696 --> 00:17:48.706 A:middle
fact that there is no new

00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:49.886 A:middle
renewal transaction for this

00:17:49.886 --> 00:17:50.936 A:middle
user through a status poll.

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:53.786 A:middle
Your server correctly makes the

00:17:54.326 --> 00:17:55.416 A:middle
calculation that this user is

00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:56.866 A:middle
not a subscriber anymore and so

00:17:56.866 --> 00:17:57.916 A:middle
when the user comes along to

00:17:57.916 --> 00:17:59.046 A:middle
access your service through the

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:00.396 A:middle
website you give them some
