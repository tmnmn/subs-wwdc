analytics and reporting tools

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.036 A:middle
available to you.

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:03.456 A:middle
But first up let's talk a bit

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:04.906 A:middle
about how to build your app and

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:05.856 A:middle
server infrastructure.

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:08.456 A:middle
Let's start off by asking a

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:10.776 A:middle
simple question, what is a

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:11.286 A:middle
subscription?

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:14.216 A:middle
Well a subscription gives a user

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.406 A:middle
access to your content or

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:17.026 A:middle
service by them repeatedly

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.476 A:middle
paying you some amount of money.

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:19.926 A:middle
When you look at this at the

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:21.596 A:middle
engineering layer a subscription

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:22.946 A:middle
is really just a set of

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:24.666 A:middle
repeating transactions each of

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.796 A:middle
which unlock some subscription

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.266 A:middle
period.

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:30.276 A:middle
To use subscriptions in your app

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:31.366 A:middle
there's a couple of things that

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.696 A:middle
you need to do as a developer to

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:33.516 A:middle
be able to handle these

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:34.766 A:middle
transactions as they come in.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:36.216 A:middle
Let's go through each of these

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:36.566 A:middle
steps.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.156 A:middle
Firstly, it starts off with your

00:01:39.156 --> 00:01:40.616 A:middle
app receiving a transaction.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:42.866 A:middle
Once your app has received a

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.166 A:middle
transaction you need to go ahead

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.226 A:middle
and verify that it's an

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:46.646 A:middle
authentic transaction, that

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:48.186 A:middle
money really has changed hands.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.376 A:middle
Then it's up to you to update

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:52.466 A:middle
and maintain that user's

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.196 A:middle
subscription state for ongoing

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:55.766 A:middle
access to your service.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:57.786 A:middle
So let's go into each of these

00:01:57.786 --> 00:01:58.656 A:middle
in a little more detail.

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:00.306 A:middle
Firstly, let's talk a bit about
