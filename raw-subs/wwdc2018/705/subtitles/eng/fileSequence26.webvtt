00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:00.326 A:middle
involuntary churn.

00:26:01.446 --> 00:26:03.326 A:middle
Involuntary churn is the loss of

00:26:03.326 --> 00:26:04.756 A:middle
a subscriber due to a failed

00:26:04.756 --> 00:26:07.466 A:middle
payment or billing issue on the

00:26:08.176 --> 00:26:08.496 A:middle
platform.

00:26:08.496 --> 00:26:10.206 A:middle
Now last year at Dub Dub DC we

00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.836 A:middle
walked you through what we're

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.186 A:middle
doing in order to minimize

00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:14.826 A:middle
involuntary churn inside of your

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:15.486 A:middle
applications.

00:26:16.306 --> 00:26:17.726 A:middle
We announced our updated Billing

00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:19.756 A:middle
Retry service where we expanded

00:26:19.756 --> 00:26:21.596 A:middle
our retry duration from 24 hours

00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:22.996 A:middle
to up to 60 days.

00:26:24.046 --> 00:26:25.646 A:middle
We also implemented new retry

00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:27.476 A:middle
strategies and we tuned them

00:26:27.746 --> 00:26:29.346 A:middle
over time to recover more and

00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:30.606 A:middle
more of your subscriptions.

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:34.666 A:middle
A date to remember is July 13th,

00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:37.146 A:middle
2017 because this is the day

00:26:37.316 --> 00:26:39.096 A:middle
that Apple actively started

00:26:39.566 --> 00:26:40.816 A:middle
recovering subscriptions for

00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:40.996 A:middle
you.

00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:45.186 A:middle
If we look at the performance of

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:47.106 A:middle
Billing Retry since launch we

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:48.456 A:middle
can see that our recovery rate

00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:49.786 A:middle
has more than doubled.

00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:52.706 A:middle
And when we look at involuntary

00:26:52.706 --> 00:26:54.946 A:middle
churn we've cut this by over 2%

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:55.956 A:middle
platform-wide.

00:26:56.516 --> 00:27:02.546 A:middle
