00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.876 A:middle
interaction and what effects

00:09:00.876 --> 00:09:02.076 A:middle
their actions are having.

00:09:02.966 --> 00:09:04.316 A:middle
However, certain conditions,

00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:05.516 A:middle
particularly inner ear

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.236 A:middle
conditions that affect the

00:09:07.236 --> 00:09:09.116 A:middle
balance center of the brain can

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:10.426 A:middle
make motion and animation

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.786 A:middle
problematic, which often results

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.416 A:middle
in things like dizziness or

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:15.916 A:middle
imbalance or even nausea.

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:18.876 A:middle
Now I'm going to go through some

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.396 A:middle
examples of animation types that

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:22.636 A:middle
can be problematic, so if any of

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:23.556 A:middle
you in the audience have a

00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:25.316 A:middle
problem with motion, then you

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:26.266 A:middle
may want to look away

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.256 A:middle
momentarily as I play the

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:28.836 A:middle
default animations, which I am

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:29.806 A:middle
going to preface.

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:32.876 A:middle
The first is scaling and

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:33.466 A:middle
zooming.

00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:35.656 A:middle
On the left, we have the default

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:36.936 A:middle
animation for opening an app,

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.736 A:middle
specifically the clock app,

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:40.106 A:middle
which I'm going to show now.

00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:43.156 A:middle
We zoom into the location of the

00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:45.176 A:middle
app's icon while it's UI scales

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:45.756 A:middle
into view.

00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:47.286 A:middle
And on the right, we have the

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.856 A:middle
same interaction but with reduce

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.556 A:middle
motion enabled, which will

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.186 A:middle
replace that with a simple cross

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:52.966 A:middle
fade.

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
Next, spinning and vortex

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:56.776 A:middle
effects.

00:09:57.316 --> 00:09:58.826 A:middle
If we take a look at the full

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.726 A:middle
screen echo effect in messages,
