00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
second, the way that an

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.386 A:middle
assistive technology user

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:03.796 A:middle
experiences your app.

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:06.486 A:middle
So let's start with visual

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:06.886 A:middle
design.

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:12.766 A:middle
I'd like to begin by addressing

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:14.116 A:middle
transparency and blurring.

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:17.166 A:middle
We use blur and transparency

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.126 A:middle
across many parts of iOS.

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:21.616 A:middle
It creates a vibrant, unique

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
look and feel for our operating

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:23.456 A:middle
system.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.426 A:middle
But for some people,

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:26.646 A:middle
particularly those with low

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:28.306 A:middle
vision conditions, blur and

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:29.606 A:middle
transparency can have negative

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.856 A:middle
impacts on legibility and even

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.436 A:middle
cause a degree of eye strain.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.476 A:middle
So we provide an accessibility

00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:36.786 A:middle
setting to reduce blur and

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:38.516 A:middle
transparency, and it can have

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:41.106 A:middle
dramatic effects like this.

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:42.836 A:middle
Instead of blurring the

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:44.686 A:middle
backdrop, we fade it so that you

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
still have the context of where

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.216 A:middle
you are in the system, but the

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:50.166 A:middle
visual noise is reduced, and the

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.566 A:middle
controls which before had color

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.076 A:middle
bleed-in from behind are more

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:54.536 A:middle
legible on their solid backdrop.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.926 A:middle
Same with folders and finally

00:03:58.926 --> 00:03:59.456 A:middle
spotlight.
