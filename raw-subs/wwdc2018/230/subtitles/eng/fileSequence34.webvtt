00:34:00.286 --> 00:34:01.176 A:middle
but be sure to correctly

00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:02.066 A:middle
localize these strings.

00:34:04.296 --> 00:34:05.856 A:middle
Each of these actions will call

00:34:05.856 --> 00:34:07.416 A:middle
a corresponding function, which

00:34:07.416 --> 00:34:08.426 A:middle
activates that button.

00:34:09.186 --> 00:34:11.076 A:middle
So, for example, map action will

00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:12.906 A:middle
call activate map button, which

00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:15.426 A:middle
activates the map button.

00:34:15.606 --> 00:34:17.266 A:middle
I've conveniently defined this

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:19.065 A:middle
function right here.

00:34:19.226 --> 00:34:22.346 A:middle
Be sure to return to [inaudible]

00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:23.766 A:middle
to indicate that your method was

00:34:23.766 --> 00:34:24.246 A:middle
successful.

00:34:25.275 --> 00:34:26.646 A:middle
And that's it for the shelter

00:34:26.646 --> 00:34:26.846 A:middle
view.

00:34:28.496 --> 00:34:30.176 A:middle
Last but not least, let's work

00:34:30.176 --> 00:34:31.525 A:middle
on improving the experience of

00:34:31.525 --> 00:34:32.025 A:middle
the modal view.

00:34:32.676 --> 00:34:35.326 A:middle
I've defined my modal view in

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:37.446 A:middle
dog modal view, and as Skyler

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:39.065 A:middle
suggested, to help VoiceOver

00:34:39.065 --> 00:34:40.306 A:middle
recognize this as a modal view,

00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:42.335 A:middle
I need to override accessibility

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:43.000 A:middle
view as modal.

00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:50.085 A:middle
We're almost done.

00:34:50.206 --> 00:34:51.226 A:middle
One thing to remember is that

00:34:51.226 --> 00:34:52.585 A:middle
when I press the gallery button,

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:54.916 A:middle
we need to let the app know that

00:34:54.916 --> 00:34:56.166 A:middle
the layout of the content on the

00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:58.016 A:middle
screen has changed so VoiceOver

00:34:58.016 --> 00:34:59.646 A:middle
can focus to the right content.
