prioritizing our action, and

00:15:02.386 --> 00:15:02.996 A:middle
consistency.

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:05.606 A:middle
It's also important to note that

00:15:05.606 --> 00:15:06.966 A:middle
if something is communicated

00:15:06.966 --> 00:15:08.416 A:middle
contextually by separate

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:10.496 A:middle
elements, that same context is

00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:11.636 A:middle
conveyed to our accessibility

00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:12.166 A:middle
users.

00:15:13.136 --> 00:15:14.726 A:middle
I'd like now to bring Bhavya up

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:16.646 A:middle
on stage to run through a quick

00:15:16.646 --> 00:15:17.836 A:middle
audit of the accessibility

00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:19.426 A:middle
experience of an app.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:19.706 A:middle
Bhavya.

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:26.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:27.726 A:middle
My name is Bhavya, and I'm a

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:28.586 A:middle
software engineer on the

00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:29.776 A:middle
Accessibility team at Apple.

00:15:30.406 --> 00:15:31.886 A:middle
Today, I'd like to talk to you

00:15:31.886 --> 00:15:32.806 A:middle
about enhancing the

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.096 A:middle
accessibility experience of your

00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:35.936 A:middle
app by sharing with you an app

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:36.856 A:middle
that Skyler and I have been

00:15:36.856 --> 00:15:37.466 A:middle
working on.

00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:39.296 A:middle
The name of this app is

00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:41.186 A:middle
Exceptional Dogs, and the goal

00:15:41.366 --> 00:15:42.756 A:middle
is to help make the dog adoption

00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:44.896 A:middle
process easier by allowing users

00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:46.226 A:middle
to browse a collection of dogs

00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:47.296 A:middle
who are in need of a loving

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:47.626 A:middle
home.

00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:49.000 A:middle
Let's take a look at this app.

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:57.866 A:middle
This is Exceptional Dogs.
