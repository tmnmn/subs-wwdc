00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:00.646 A:middle
of the messages bubbles in a

00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:01.466 A:middle
conversation.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.286 A:middle
It's a little hard to see in

00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:04.416 A:middle
this video, but it's a lot more

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:05.516 A:middle
obvious on device.

00:11:06.196 --> 00:11:08.306 A:middle
As I scroll the messages, they

00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:09.916 A:middle
have a springiness to them where

00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:12.196 A:middle
they contract and expand away

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:14.576 A:middle
from one another.

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:15.866 A:middle
If we have reduce motion

00:11:15.866 --> 00:11:17.706 A:middle
enabled, then we disable this

00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:19.236 A:middle
effect and have them just scroll

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:19.636 A:middle
normally.

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:24.486 A:middle
Finally, we have peripheral

00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:25.006 A:middle
movement.

00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.536 A:middle
The weather app on iOS has

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:29.106 A:middle
subtle animations that play in

00:11:29.106 --> 00:11:30.756 A:middle
the background to indicate the

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.166 A:middle
current weather condition.

00:11:32.616 --> 00:11:33.596 A:middle
You cans see on the left that

00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:35.146 A:middle
the clouds are sort of drifting

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:36.296 A:middle
through the air and the sun is

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:38.416 A:middle
sort of shimmering and shining.

00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:39.816 A:middle
But if you're scanning the

00:11:39.816 --> 00:11:41.086 A:middle
forecast below, then this

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:43.026 A:middle
animation is in your peripheral

00:11:43.026 --> 00:11:44.526 A:middle
view, and this can be

00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:46.226 A:middle
problematic in the same way that

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:48.176 A:middle
reading while riding in a car

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:49.406 A:middle
can make you feel sick.

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:51.656 A:middle
The horizontal motion above your

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:53.036 A:middle
area of focus triggers a

00:11:53.036 --> 00:11:54.386 A:middle
reaction in your brain.

00:11:55.016 --> 00:11:56.806 A:middle
With reduced motion on, we

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:57.686 A:middle
disable the background

00:11:57.686 --> 00:11:58.276 A:middle
animation.

00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:01.326 A:middle
Now typically we don't want to
