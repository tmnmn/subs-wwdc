00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:02.276 A:middle
Now this is a particularly good

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.936 A:middle
example, because we've taken a

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:05.746 A:middle
sample of the user's wallpaper

00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:06.936 A:middle
so that we can color the

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:08.486 A:middle
backdrop, and they could still

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:10.396 A:middle
feel personalized and contextual

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:12.176 A:middle
to the device, but we still get

00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:13.616 A:middle
that increased contrast and

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.306 A:middle
legibility of having a solid

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:15.756 A:middle
background.

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.776 A:middle
As a developer, you can cater

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:20.065 A:middle
your own use of blurring and

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:21.846 A:middle
transparency by checking whether

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:23.106 A:middle
or not the reduced transparency

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:24.676 A:middle
setting is enabled and adapting

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:25.596 A:middle
your UI accordingly.

00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:28.136 A:middle
On iOS, you would use is reduce

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.866 A:middle
transparency enabled on UI

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:32.576 A:middle
accessibility, and on macOS,

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.326 A:middle
accessibility display should

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:36.116 A:middle
reduce transparency on NS

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:36.706 A:middle
Workspace.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:39.656 A:middle
Next, I'd like to talk about

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:40.436 A:middle
contrast.

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:43.756 A:middle
Contrast between content and

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:45.486 A:middle
it's background is hugely

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:46.506 A:middle
important when it comes to

00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:47.456 A:middle
perceivability.

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:49.546 A:middle
As colors get closer to one

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:51.106 A:middle
another, they become more

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:52.406 A:middle
difficult to distinguish.

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:54.886 A:middle
As well, certain colors that are

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:56.756 A:middle
legible at bigger sizes don't

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:58.056 A:middle
work when content is scaled

00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:58.436 A:middle
down.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.296 A:middle
For example, with text, the
