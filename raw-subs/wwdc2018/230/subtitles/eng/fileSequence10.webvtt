screen echo effect in messages,

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.756 A:middle
which I'm going to show now, we

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:04.336 A:middle
can see that content is spinning

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:06.006 A:middle
along the Z axis while also

00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:07.816 A:middle
changing in scale, and these

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.096 A:middle
types of motions paired together

00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:10.116 A:middle
can cause issues.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:12.556 A:middle
In the case of message effects,

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:14.006 A:middle
if reduced motion is enabled,

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:15.476 A:middle
then we provide the user with a

00:10:15.476 --> 00:10:18.086 A:middle
specific prompt to play the

00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:19.786 A:middle
message effect instead of having

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:20.506 A:middle
it autoplay.

00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:21.426 A:middle
So they can choose whether or

00:10:21.426 --> 00:10:23.076 A:middle
not they want to see it.

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:25.556 A:middle
Next, we have plane-shifting

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:26.316 A:middle
animations.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:28.116 A:middle
What I want to show here is the

00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:29.616 A:middle
Safari tabs animation.

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:31.336 A:middle
So I'm going to tap on the show

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:33.346 A:middle
tabs button, and you see that

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:34.786 A:middle
the plane of the web cards is

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:36.726 A:middle
shifted to simulate a 3D space.

00:10:37.496 --> 00:10:38.696 A:middle
And on the right, we have the

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:40.486 A:middle
reduced animation, which again

00:10:40.486 --> 00:10:42.536 A:middle
is a simple cross fade, but we

00:10:42.536 --> 00:10:44.996 A:middle
also blink the card so that you

00:10:44.996 --> 00:10:46.666 A:middle
have the context of which one

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:49.536 A:middle
you're coming from that you got

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:53.000 A:middle
in the original animation.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.186 A:middle
Multidirectional or multispeed

00:10:56.246 --> 00:10:57.636 A:middle
motion is another trigger.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.496 A:middle
I'm going to show the movement

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:00.646 A:middle
of the messages bubbles in a
