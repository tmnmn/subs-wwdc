00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.196 A:middle
increment and decrement

00:27:00.196 --> 00:27:00.916 A:middle
functionality.

00:27:01.456 --> 00:27:02.836 A:middle
First, we'd like to override

00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:04.396 A:middle
accessibility traits to return

00:27:04.396 --> 00:27:08.826 A:middle
the adjustable trait.

00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:10.086 A:middle
Let's first implement

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:11.096 A:middle
accessibility increment.

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:16.366 A:middle
We want our increment function

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:17.616 A:middle
to scroll the collection view

00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:17.996 A:middle
forward.

00:27:18.376 --> 00:27:19.536 A:middle
So let's create a function that

00:27:19.536 --> 00:27:19.976 A:middle
does exactly that.

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:29.126 A:middle
Here, I have a function called

00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:30.606 A:middle
accessibility scroll collection

00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:30.806 A:middle
view.

00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:32.926 A:middle
It takes in a bullion, which

00:27:32.926 --> 00:27:34.036 A:middle
determines if the collection

00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:35.196 A:middle
view will scroll forwards or

00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:35.746 A:middle
backwards.

00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:37.786 A:middle
Let's dive into this function.

00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:39.866 A:middle
I get a reference to my

00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:42.256 A:middle
container view, my current dog,

00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:44.086 A:middle
and my list of all the dogs.

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.176 A:middle
If I'm moving forwards, I get

00:27:47.176 --> 00:27:49.116 A:middle
the index of my current dog, and

00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:50.796 A:middle
I validate that it doesn't

00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:53.326 A:middle
exceed out of bounds, and if

00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:54.896 A:middle
doesn't, I'll ask my collection

00:27:54.896 --> 00:27:55.906 A:middle
view to scroll forward by one

00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:56.366 A:middle
index.

00:27:57.286 --> 00:27:58.696 A:middle
I'll do something similar if I'm

00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:01.006 A:middle
going backwards except I'll make
