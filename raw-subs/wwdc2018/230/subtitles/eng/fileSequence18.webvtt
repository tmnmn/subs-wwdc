00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:01.076 A:middle
currently, using swiping we

00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:02.006 A:middle
aren't able to reach the

00:18:02.006 --> 00:18:03.376 A:middle
favorite or gallery buttons

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.496 A:middle
until we hit the very end of the

00:18:04.496 --> 00:18:04.976 A:middle
carousel.

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:06.556 A:middle
This isn't a great or

00:18:06.556 --> 00:18:08.066 A:middle
exceptional experience because

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:09.526 A:middle
it really limits my ability to

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:10.896 A:middle
favorite or view the galleries

00:18:10.896 --> 00:18:12.326 A:middle
for virtually all of the dogs in

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
the carousel.

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.366 A:middle
I'll place my finger over the

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:16.936 A:middle
modal view now to activate the

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:17.596 A:middle
gallery button.

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:19.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Show gallery.

00:18:19.406 --> 00:18:20.376 A:middle
Show gallery.

00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:22.006 A:middle
Picture one of Bro.

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:22.816 A:middle
Image.

00:18:23.626 --> 00:18:24.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's scroll through our

00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:24.826 A:middle
gallery.

00:18:25.196 --> 00:18:26.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Picture two of Bro.

00:18:26.876 --> 00:18:28.356 A:middle
Picture three of Bro.

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:29.576 A:middle
Pinky.

00:18:30.646 --> 00:18:31.126 A:middle
Layla.

00:18:32.556 --> 00:18:34.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, we were successfully able

00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:35.096 A:middle
to scroll through the gallery

00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:36.916 A:middle
with VoiceOver but focus went

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.366 A:middle
behind the modal view to the

00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:39.496 A:middle
content in the background.

00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:41.286 A:middle
This experience might seem

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.626 A:middle
workable because it gets the

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:43.786 A:middle
user to the content that they

00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:45.736 A:middle
need to, but it's not great or

00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:47.306 A:middle
exceptional because allowing

00:18:47.306 --> 00:18:48.596 A:middle
focus to go behind the modal

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:50.046 A:middle
view is confusing and

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.096 A:middle
distracting for the user.

00:18:51.846 --> 00:18:53.356 A:middle
I elected the modal view now by

00:18:53.356 --> 00:18:56.326 A:middle
double tapping on the close

00:18:56.676 --> 00:18:56.896 A:middle
button.

00:18:56.996 --> 00:18:58.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Close, Layla.

00:18:59.816 --> 00:19:01.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's swipe through our stats
