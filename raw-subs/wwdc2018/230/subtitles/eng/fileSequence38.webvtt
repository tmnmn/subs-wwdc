and modelling the interaction

00:38:01.216 --> 00:38:02.896 A:middle
around this experience, and in

00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:04.686 A:middle
doing so, we've lifted a huge

00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:06.036 A:middle
cognitive burden off the user.

00:38:06.636 --> 00:38:08.256 A:middle
Your users will love this extra

00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:09.496 A:middle
bit of effort you put towards

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.226 A:middle
the accessibility of the app so

00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:12.196 A:middle
they can love it as much as

00:38:12.196 --> 00:38:12.786 A:middle
anyone else.

00:38:13.306 --> 00:38:14.076 A:middle
I'd like to hand it back to

00:38:14.076 --> 00:38:16.436 A:middle
Skyler now.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Bhavya.

00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:23.826 A:middle
Hopefully Bhavya's demo

00:38:23.826 --> 00:38:25.756 A:middle
demonstrated for you how small

00:38:25.756 --> 00:38:27.106 A:middle
tweaks can transform the

00:38:27.106 --> 00:38:28.546 A:middle
accessibility experience for the

00:38:28.546 --> 00:38:28.936 A:middle
better.

00:38:29.786 --> 00:38:30.866 A:middle
It's important to note that

00:38:30.866 --> 00:38:32.796 A:middle
creating custom interfaces for

00:38:32.796 --> 00:38:34.176 A:middle
the accessibility of your app is

00:38:34.176 --> 00:38:35.836 A:middle
not always the right answer.

00:38:36.456 --> 00:38:38.266 A:middle
Sometimes the simple fix is the

00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:40.996 A:middle
best fix, but what you really

00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:42.436 A:middle
should be doing when making your

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:44.716 A:middle
apps accessible is thinking

00:38:44.716 --> 00:38:46.376 A:middle
through beyond the surface level

00:38:46.376 --> 00:38:47.856 A:middle
what it will really mean for

00:38:47.856 --> 00:38:49.486 A:middle
someone who's using an assistive

00:38:49.486 --> 00:38:53.036 A:middle
technology to use your app.

00:38:53.276 --> 00:38:54.476 A:middle
To wrap this up, I'd like to

00:38:54.476 --> 00:38:55.556 A:middle
return to where we started

00:38:55.556 --> 00:38:55.916 A:middle
today.

00:38:56.696 --> 00:38:58.676 A:middle
Usable is a great first step for

00:38:58.676 --> 00:39:00.866 A:middle
making apps accessible, but we
