00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.296 A:middle
For example, with text, the

00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:01.586 A:middle
letters bleed together more

00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:03.106 A:middle
easily at smaller sizes.

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.026 A:middle
Now you can compute the contrast

00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:07.816 A:middle
ratio between a particular color

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:09.436 A:middle
combination to see whether or

00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:10.886 A:middle
not it's going to be legible,

00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:12.046 A:middle
and we followed the

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.406 A:middle
recommendations laid out in the

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:14.796 A:middle
web content accessibility

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:16.506 A:middle
guidelines that states that the

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:18.296 A:middle
minimum contrast ratio you

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:20.756 A:middle
should aim for is 4.5 to 1.

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
Obviously, the highest contrast

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:24.766 A:middle
that you're going to be able to

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:26.206 A:middle
get is between black and white,

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:28.876 A:middle
which comes out to be 21 to 1

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.566 A:middle
and obviously works great at all

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:31.356 A:middle
text sizes.

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.176 A:middle
Now let's take a look at a shade

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:33.606 A:middle
of gray.

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
This particular gray will work

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:38.506 A:middle
great for larger text, but it

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:39.966 A:middle
isn't so great for smaller text

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:40.996 A:middle
because your eyes can't

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:41.966 A:middle
distinguish the shapes of the

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:42.676 A:middle
letter forms.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:45.566 A:middle
It's contrast ratio 4.5 to 1 is

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:47.246 A:middle
right on the line of passable.

00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:49.346 A:middle
Let's like take a look at one

00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:49.906 A:middle
last gray.

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:52.686 A:middle
It may not be apparent on this

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.926 A:middle
really large display, but this

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.926 A:middle
text is really hard to see on a

00:05:57.926 --> 00:05:59.806 A:middle
small device, even at a large

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:00.576 A:middle
font size.
