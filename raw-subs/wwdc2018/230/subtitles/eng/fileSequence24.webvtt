00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:01.896 A:middle
You can return an array of

00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:03.886 A:middle
custom actions for a given view,

00:24:04.806 --> 00:24:06.726 A:middle
and then for each action, you

00:24:06.726 --> 00:24:08.356 A:middle
have a name, which is conveyed

00:24:08.356 --> 00:24:09.626 A:middle
to the user as what's going to

00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:11.116 A:middle
happen when they activate that

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:13.666 A:middle
action, and a target selector

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.446 A:middle
relationship, which will execute

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:17.586 A:middle
the action in your code.

00:24:17.806 --> 00:24:19.056 A:middle
So we'll make that whole shelter

00:24:19.056 --> 00:24:20.696 A:middle
view accessible and add custom

00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:21.626 A:middle
actions to it for getting the

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:24.056 A:middle
location and calling.

00:24:24.456 --> 00:24:25.496 A:middle
Finally, we have the gallery

00:24:25.496 --> 00:24:25.776 A:middle
view.

00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:28.186 A:middle
When Bhavya brought this up, we

00:24:28.186 --> 00:24:29.386 A:middle
could swipe through all of the

00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:31.936 A:middle
elements in the background, and

00:24:31.936 --> 00:24:33.746 A:middle
though this view apps modal,

00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:36.326 A:middle
that isn't the case, because

00:24:36.326 --> 00:24:37.966 A:middle
instead of housing this view in

00:24:37.966 --> 00:24:39.336 A:middle
a view controller and presenting

00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:41.466 A:middle
it modally, we instead opted to

00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:43.146 A:middle
just add it on top of a view

00:24:43.146 --> 00:24:43.766 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:46.506 A:middle
And so since the content in the

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:48.106 A:middle
background is still visible,

00:24:48.716 --> 00:24:49.786 A:middle
VoiceOver doesn't know that it

00:24:49.786 --> 00:24:50.516 A:middle
should exclude it.

00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:52.736 A:middle
Although everything in the

00:24:52.736 --> 00:24:54.046 A:middle
gallery is accessible to

00:24:54.046 --> 00:24:56.006 A:middle
VoiceOver, it gets confusing to

00:24:56.006 --> 00:24:57.996 A:middle
the user whose lost the context

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.136 A:middle
of where they are and what

00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.566 A:middle
effect their actions are having.
