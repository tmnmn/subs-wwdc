00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:01.326 A:middle
Now typically we don't want to

00:12:01.326 --> 00:12:03.766 A:middle
just remove all animation, so of

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:04.576 A:middle
course we have a setting that

00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:05.816 A:middle
you can check to see if motion

00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:07.566 A:middle
should be reduced and adapt

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:08.186 A:middle
accordingly.

00:12:09.116 --> 00:12:10.596 A:middle
On iOS, you check is reduced

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.926 A:middle
motion enabled, and on macOS,

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:14.606 A:middle
check accessibility display

00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:15.606 A:middle
should reduce motion.

00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:18.046 A:middle
It's important to note that

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:19.936 A:middle
simply removing an animation is

00:12:19.936 --> 00:12:21.216 A:middle
often not an adequate

00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
experience.

00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:23.966 A:middle
You don't want to lessen the

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:24.686 A:middle
experience.

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:27.156 A:middle
You just want to add something

00:12:27.156 --> 00:12:28.806 A:middle
else equally fun or engaging but

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:29.876 A:middle
different that works for the

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:30.266 A:middle
user.

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:33.416 A:middle
Finally, I'd like to finish

00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.586 A:middle
talking about design by

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:36.306 A:middle
addressing UI complexity.

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:39.236 A:middle
Apps play key roles in our lives

00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:40.696 A:middle
now, and it's critically

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:42.366 A:middle
important for all of us that our

00:12:42.366 --> 00:12:44.246 A:middle
technology is simple and easy to

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
use, that it enhances our lives

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:47.856 A:middle
instead of adding extra

00:12:47.856 --> 00:12:48.836 A:middle
unnecessary burden.

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:52.336 A:middle
In the United States alone, one

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:53.336 A:middle
in six children have a

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:55.276 A:middle
developmental disability ranging

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:56.306 A:middle
from speech and language

00:12:56.306 --> 00:12:58.016 A:middle
impairments to more serious

00:12:58.016 --> 00:12:59.306 A:middle
developmental disabilities like

00:12:59.306 --> 00:12:59.896 A:middle
autism.
