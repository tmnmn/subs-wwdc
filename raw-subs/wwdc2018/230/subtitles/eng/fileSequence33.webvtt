00:32:59.986 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
And that's it for the dog stats

00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:04.056 A:middle
view.

00:33:05.336 --> 00:33:06.876 A:middle
Next, let's work on adding some

00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:08.426 A:middle
context to the call and open

00:33:08.426 --> 00:33:09.436 A:middle
location buttons.

00:33:10.056 --> 00:33:12.546 A:middle
I'll head over to the shelter

00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:14.906 A:middle
info view where I have a

00:33:14.906 --> 00:33:16.016 A:middle
reference to the name of my

00:33:16.016 --> 00:33:18.416 A:middle
shelter, the map button, and the

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:18.916 A:middle
call button.

00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:22.236 A:middle
We'd like the actions of both of

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:24.166 A:middle
these buttons to be custom

00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:25.316 A:middle
actions on their containing

00:33:25.316 --> 00:33:27.246 A:middle
view, and to achieve this, we

00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:28.486 A:middle
can start by exposing that

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:29.246 A:middle
containing view as an

00:33:29.246 --> 00:33:30.216 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:35.566 A:middle
Let's go ahead and give this a

00:33:35.566 --> 00:33:36.756 A:middle
descriptive label, which would

00:33:36.756 --> 00:33:38.000 A:middle
be the name of the shelter.

00:33:42.686 --> 00:33:43.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Finally, let's override

00:33:43.876 --> 00:33:45.436 A:middle
accessibility custom actions.

00:33:50.056 --> 00:33:51.296 A:middle
Within this function, we'll

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:53.536 A:middle
create two custom actions, the

00:33:53.536 --> 00:33:55.516 A:middle
map action and the call action.

00:33:56.456 --> 00:33:58.276 A:middle
VoiceOver will describe these as

00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:59.936 A:middle
open address in maps and call,
