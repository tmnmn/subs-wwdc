00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:02.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can also swipe from left to

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:03.516 A:middle
right to get to the favorite and

00:36:03.516 --> 00:36:04.676 A:middle
gallery buttons like this.

00:36:05.186 --> 00:36:07.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Favorite, off, button, show

00:36:07.756 --> 00:36:09.066 A:middle
gallery, button.

00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:12.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, not only is every dog in

00:36:12.046 --> 00:36:13.356 A:middle
the carousel accessible to me

00:36:13.406 --> 00:36:14.726 A:middle
but so are the favorite and

00:36:14.726 --> 00:36:16.226 A:middle
gallery buttons from every dog

00:36:16.226 --> 00:36:16.856 A:middle
in the carousel.

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.546 A:middle
I can swipe once more from left

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:21.236 A:middle
to right to skip the carousel

00:36:21.236 --> 00:36:22.656 A:middle
and get to the stats view like

00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:23.076 A:middle
this.

00:36:23.726 --> 00:36:25.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Name, Pinky.

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:26.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I don't have to navigate

00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:27.716 A:middle
to the whole carousel.

00:36:28.376 --> 00:36:29.376 A:middle
This feels like a much better

00:36:29.376 --> 00:36:30.086 A:middle
experience now.

00:36:31.136 --> 00:36:31.896 A:middle
Let's go ahead and keep

00:36:31.896 --> 00:36:33.036 A:middle
navigating through our stats

00:36:33.036 --> 00:36:34.006 A:middle
view to see what the experience

00:36:34.006 --> 00:36:34.376 A:middle
is like.

00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:35.886 A:middle
I'm going to swipe from left to

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:37.016 A:middle
right to navigate through it.

00:36:37.626 --> 00:36:38.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Breed, mixed.

00:36:39.486 --> 00:36:41.736 A:middle
Age, 7.0 years.

00:36:43.036 --> 00:36:44.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Since this information is

00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:45.246 A:middle
grouped together now, it

00:36:45.366 --> 00:36:46.486 A:middle
provides me with way more

00:36:46.486 --> 00:36:48.816 A:middle
context and navigation is faster

00:36:48.816 --> 00:36:50.116 A:middle
since I don't have to navigate

00:36:50.116 --> 00:36:50.886 A:middle
through each and every

00:36:50.886 --> 00:36:51.676 A:middle
individual label.

00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:54.466 A:middle
I'll place my finger over the

00:36:54.466 --> 00:36:55.336 A:middle
name of the shelter now.

00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:57.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Skyler's animal shelter.

00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:00.316 A:middle
Actions available.
