00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:01.216 A:middle
accessible into four areas of

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:06.616 A:middle
focus, cognitive, motor, vision,

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.526 A:middle
and hearing.

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:10.846 A:middle
Now we have a bunch of great

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:12.326 A:middle
features that we work on to

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:14.086 A:middle
address all of these areas, but

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:16.396 A:middle
at the end of the day, it's the

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:18.536 A:middle
work that you do in tandem with

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.106 A:middle
our assistive technologies that

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.796 A:middle
make our platforms stellar

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:22.826 A:middle
places for people with

00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:23.536 A:middle
disabilities.

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.866 A:middle
Making sure that all the great

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.376 A:middle
content you work on is

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.476 A:middle
accessible to everyone creates a

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:31.636 A:middle
better, more inclusive community

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
for all of us and fundamentally

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.186 A:middle
improves the lives of millions

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.236 A:middle
of people around the world.

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:39.746 A:middle
For today's talk, we're going to

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:41.666 A:middle
skip past a lot of the basics of

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.876 A:middle
making apps accessible.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:45.026 A:middle
However, if this is your first

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.966 A:middle
exposure to accessibility or

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.116 A:middle
you've never checked out any of

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:49.866 A:middle
our accessibility APIs before,

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:51.526 A:middle
then I highly recommend that you

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:52.876 A:middle
check out some of the sessions

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:53.806 A:middle
from last year's WWDC.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:56.156 A:middle
There's still a lot that you're

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:57.306 A:middle
going to be able to gain from

00:01:57.306 --> 00:01:58.016 A:middle
our session.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.626 A:middle
It may just feel like it's going

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:01.546 A:middle
a little fast for you because
