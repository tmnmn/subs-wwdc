00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:00.586 A:middle
make sure that VoiceOver can

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.936 A:middle
reach every element on screen.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.596 A:middle
So let's turn on VoiceOver now

00:17:04.935 --> 00:17:06.846 A:middle
and see how a nonsighted or low

00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:09.236 A:middle
vision user would digest all of

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:12.000 A:middle
this complexity.

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:15.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:17.205 A:middle
Exceptional Dogs.

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:18.165 A:middle
Pinky.

00:17:19.096 --> 00:17:20.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So VoiceOver lands on the

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:21.396 A:middle
image and correctly announces

00:17:21.396 --> 00:17:22.116 A:middle
the name of the dog.

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:22.836 A:middle
Great.

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.965 A:middle
I'm going to swipe from left to

00:17:24.965 --> 00:17:26.016 A:middle
right now to scroll through the

00:17:26.016 --> 00:17:26.496 A:middle
carousel.

00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:29.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Layla, Bro, Pudding.

00:17:30.726 --> 00:17:34.156 A:middle
Favorite off button, Pudding,

00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:35.176 A:middle
Bro.

00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:37.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So VoiceOver was able to

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.096 A:middle
correctly scroll through the

00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:40.276 A:middle
carousel, but we weren't able to

00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:41.656 A:middle
reach the favorite button until

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:42.486 A:middle
we hit the very end of the

00:17:42.486 --> 00:17:43.016 A:middle
carousel.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.176 A:middle
I could, of course, still get to

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:46.416 A:middle
the favorite button by placing

00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:47.656 A:middle
my finger on it like this.

00:17:48.236 --> 00:17:50.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Favorite off button.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:51.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; But it's important to

00:17:51.656 --> 00:17:52.976 A:middle
remember that this is not how a

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:54.006 A:middle
typical VoiceOver user

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:54.606 A:middle
navigates.

00:17:55.206 --> 00:17:57.296 A:middle
Rather, VoiceOver users swipe to

00:17:57.296 --> 00:17:58.936 A:middle
reach to the next element, and

00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:01.076 A:middle
currently, using swiping we
