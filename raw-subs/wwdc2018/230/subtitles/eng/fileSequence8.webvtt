00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:00.486 A:middle
that and instead encourage you

00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
to check out some of the

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:03.186 A:middle
fantastic resources that we have

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:04.726 A:middle
to figure out the best way to

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:06.566 A:middle
get dynamic type working in your

00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:07.856 A:middle
own apps.

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:11.026 A:middle
Now for some, changing the size

00:08:11.026 --> 00:08:13.296 A:middle
of text is overkill, but the

00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:15.246 A:middle
default weight of fonts and

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.526 A:middle
glyphs can still make it

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:17.396 A:middle
difficult to read.

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.616 A:middle
So on iOS there's a setting for

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
enabling bold text, which will

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.806 A:middle
also increase the stroke weight

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:23.436 A:middle
of glyphs.

00:08:24.456 --> 00:08:26.566 A:middle
If you're using stand built-in

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:28.816 A:middle
UI controls and a system font,

00:08:29.206 --> 00:08:30.386 A:middle
then it's likely that you don't

00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:31.866 A:middle
need to do anything to get bold

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.166 A:middle
text working in your app, but if

00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:35.256 A:middle
you're using your own text

00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:37.756 A:middle
solution or a custom font, or

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:38.996 A:middle
you simply want to do something

00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.696 A:middle
like making the dividing lines

00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:41.996 A:middle
in your app thicker when bold

00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:43.826 A:middle
text is on, then you can check

00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:44.646 A:middle
whether or not the setting is

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:46.336 A:middle
enabled and adapt as necessary.

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:50.096 A:middle
Next, we have motion.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:53.606 A:middle
Animation is fun, and it often

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:55.096 A:middle
makes content feel more alive.

00:08:55.096 --> 00:08:57.006 A:middle
It can provide a direct

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.976 A:middle
correlation between user

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.876 A:middle
interaction and what effects
