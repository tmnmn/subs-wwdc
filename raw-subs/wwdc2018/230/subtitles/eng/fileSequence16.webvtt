00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.406 A:middle
At the top, I have a carousel

00:16:00.406 --> 00:16:02.216 A:middle
like UI, which is essentially a

00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:03.346 A:middle
collection view of all the

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:04.206 A:middle
different dogs that I can

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:04.506 A:middle
browse.

00:16:05.796 --> 00:16:06.946 A:middle
In the bottom left corner, I

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:08.156 A:middle
have a favorite button so that I

00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:09.456 A:middle
can favorite particular dogs I

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.246 A:middle
like, and in the bottom right

00:16:11.246 --> 00:16:12.726 A:middle
corner, I have a gallery button,

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:14.226 A:middle
which brings up a modal view

00:16:14.426 --> 00:16:15.516 A:middle
with additional photos of the

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.000 A:middle
dog.

00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:20.026 A:middle
However, not all dogs have a

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:20.736 A:middle
gallery button.

00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:22.546 A:middle
Notice how this button fades

00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:25.156 A:middle
away as swipe to Layla, who has

00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:26.046 A:middle
no additional pictures.

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:29.026 A:middle
Beneath the carousel I have a

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:30.476 A:middle
stats view with information

00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:31.956 A:middle
about the dog like its name and

00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:32.336 A:middle
breed.

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:34.236 A:middle
Notice how this information

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:35.836 A:middle
updates as I swipe to the next

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:36.546 A:middle
dog in the carousel.

00:16:38.316 --> 00:16:40.476 A:middle
Finally, at the bottom I have

00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:41.806 A:middle
the name of the shelter with two

00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:42.946 A:middle
buttons which can open the

00:16:42.946 --> 00:16:44.366 A:middle
location of the shelter in maps

00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
or call the location.

00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:51.266 A:middle
So there's quite a bit going on

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:52.106 A:middle
here in terms of visual

00:16:52.106 --> 00:16:54.676 A:middle
complexity, but Skyler and I

00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:56.236 A:middle
done our due diligence, and

00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:57.556 A:middle
we've sprinkled in a little bit

00:16:57.556 --> 00:16:59.526 A:middle
of accessibility, just enough to

00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:00.586 A:middle
make sure that VoiceOver can
