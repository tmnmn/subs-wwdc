00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:01.546 A:middle
a little fast for you because

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:02.816 A:middle
today we're going to focus on

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.456 A:middle
going beyond the basics, and I

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:07.306 A:middle
want to start by focusing in on

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:09.966 A:middle
this one word, usable.

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:13.276 A:middle
Usable is great, making sure

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:14.656 A:middle
that all of the content of your

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.116 A:middle
app is even visible to an

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:17.606 A:middle
assistive technology is a

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:18.796 A:middle
critical first step.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:21.466 A:middle
But when it comes down to it, we

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.036 A:middle
don't want our apps to just be

00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:24.196 A:middle
usable, right.

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:25.786 A:middle
No one's going to be out there

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:27.576 A:middle
bragging that their app is

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:28.356 A:middle
usable.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:31.396 A:middle
They want it to be exceptional.

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:33.696 A:middle
We want people who use them to

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:35.296 A:middle
be delighted when they do.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:37.336 A:middle
It may not be clear to you

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:38.926 A:middle
exactly what that means when it

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.796 A:middle
comes to accessibility, and

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:41.806 A:middle
that's what we're here to talk

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:43.536 A:middle
about today and hopefully

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.326 A:middle
provide you with some helpful

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:46.836 A:middle
guidance on how to do that.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.286 A:middle
I'd like to focus on two main

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.416 A:middle
areas and the different

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:52.616 A:middle
considerations that you'll want

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:54.666 A:middle
to make for each when evaluating

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:56.196 A:middle
the accessibility of your own

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:56.406 A:middle
app.

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:59.336 A:middle
First, visual design, and

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
second, the way that an
