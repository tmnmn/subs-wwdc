00:20:58.246 --> 00:21:00.056 A:middle
accessibility element to create

00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:01.766 A:middle
a new element in place of the

00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:02.476 A:middle
collection view.

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:04.696 A:middle
UI accessibility element is a

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.406 A:middle
class used to create custom

00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:08.356 A:middle
elements oftentimes for

00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:09.606 A:middle
representing parts of your UI

00:21:09.606 --> 00:21:10.726 A:middle
that are inaccessible, like

00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:12.036 A:middle
something you've drawn in Core

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:12.986 A:middle
Graphics for instance.

00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:15.976 A:middle
But we can also leverage it to

00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:17.436 A:middle
create a custom experience,

00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:18.386 A:middle
which is what we're going to do

00:21:18.386 --> 00:21:18.966 A:middle
in this case.

00:21:20.236 --> 00:21:21.576 A:middle
We'll need to return any custom

00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:23.246 A:middle
elements from the accessibility

00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:24.806 A:middle
elements property for the view

00:21:24.806 --> 00:21:25.696 A:middle
that would contain them.

00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:27.216 A:middle
This tells our assistive

00:21:27.216 --> 00:21:30.686 A:middle
technology what the accessible

00:21:30.686 --> 00:21:32.596 A:middle
sub elements of a given view are

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:33.806 A:middle
and the order that they should

00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:34.456 A:middle
be navigable.

00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:37.746 A:middle
So if we get our custom element

00:21:37.746 --> 00:21:39.186 A:middle
in place, we can swipe to the

00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:40.386 A:middle
content for each dog easily.

00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:40.786 A:middle
Great.

00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:43.606 A:middle
But then how do we change dogs?

00:21:45.266 --> 00:21:46.326 A:middle
Well, we can take advantage of

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:47.596 A:middle
accessibility increment and

00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:48.866 A:middle
accessibility decrement.

00:21:49.276 --> 00:21:50.966 A:middle
By adding the adjustable trait

00:21:50.966 --> 00:21:52.936 A:middle
to our custom element, we'll let

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:54.386 A:middle
the assistive technique know

00:21:54.386 --> 00:21:55.756 A:middle
that our element responds to

00:21:55.756 --> 00:21:57.376 A:middle
these callbacks so that in the

00:21:57.376 --> 00:21:59.286 A:middle
case of VoiceOver when a user

00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:00.586 A:middle
swipes up or down with their
