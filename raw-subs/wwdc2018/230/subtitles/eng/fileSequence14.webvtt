00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.506 A:middle
just as important for people who

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.966 A:middle
use assistive technologies like

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.236 A:middle
VoiceOver or Switch Control.

00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:05.486 A:middle
So I'd like now to spend some

00:14:05.486 --> 00:14:06.616 A:middle
time speaking to how you can

00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:08.216 A:middle
improve the experience for those

00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:09.426 A:middle
accessibility users.

00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:12.306 A:middle
The experience for assistive

00:14:12.306 --> 00:14:13.796 A:middle
tech like VoiceOver and Switch

00:14:13.796 --> 00:14:15.346 A:middle
Control can be quite different

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:16.476 A:middle
from your typical user

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:17.256 A:middle
experience.

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:19.326 A:middle
VoiceOver uses many gestures

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:21.256 A:middle
like swipes and multifinger

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:22.556 A:middle
taps,

00:14:25.076 --> 00:14:26.806 A:middle
while Switch Control scans

00:14:26.806 --> 00:14:28.516 A:middle
groups and offers logical quick

00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:29.256 A:middle
actions.

00:14:29.726 --> 00:14:31.386 A:middle
For both, there are built-in

00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:32.756 A:middle
equivalents for any standard

00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:35.626 A:middle
gesture or interaction, but what

00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:37.086 A:middle
makes experiencing an app with

00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:38.446 A:middle
these technologies exceptional?

00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:40.486 A:middle
We want to go from the bare

00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:43.576 A:middle
minimum of it works to it works

00:14:43.576 --> 00:14:43.896 A:middle
well.

00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:46.736 A:middle
While despite the fact that

00:14:46.736 --> 00:14:48.486 A:middle
assistive tech users experience

00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:49.996 A:middle
your app in ways that are

00:14:49.996 --> 00:14:51.756 A:middle
different, the same design

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:53.256 A:middle
principles that drive a good

00:14:53.256 --> 00:14:53.976 A:middle
experience for a

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.646 A:middle
nonaccessibility user applies

00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:55.906 A:middle
here.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.146 A:middle
You want easy navigation,

00:14:58.526 --> 00:14:59.726 A:middle
predictable behavior,

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:02.386 A:middle
prioritizing our action, and
