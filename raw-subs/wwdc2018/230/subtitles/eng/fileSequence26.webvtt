00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:01.296 A:middle
houses our collection view of

00:26:01.296 --> 00:26:02.876 A:middle
the dogs, our favorite button,

00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:04.016 A:middle
and our gallery button.

00:26:04.406 --> 00:26:06.096 A:middle
As Skyler mentioned, we'd like

00:26:06.096 --> 00:26:07.166 A:middle
to implement the increment and

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.616 A:middle
decrement functionality so that

00:26:08.616 --> 00:26:09.996 A:middle
we can swipe up and down to

00:26:09.996 --> 00:26:10.986 A:middle
scroll through our carousel.

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:13.146 A:middle
To do this, we can create a

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:14.946 A:middle
property on this class called

00:26:14.946 --> 00:26:16.416 A:middle
carousel accessibility element,

00:26:17.246 --> 00:26:18.276 A:middle
which will be a custom UI

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:19.516 A:middle
accessibility element that

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:20.676 A:middle
supports those gestures.

00:26:21.286 --> 00:26:23.496 A:middle
Let's implement carousel

00:26:23.496 --> 00:26:24.466 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:26:28.836 --> 00:26:30.336 A:middle
This will be a subclass of UI

00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:31.376 A:middle
accessibility element.

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.136 A:middle
It also needs to know about the

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:34.216 A:middle
current dog object it's

00:26:34.216 --> 00:26:35.476 A:middle
representing, so let's create a

00:26:35.476 --> 00:26:36.846 A:middle
property for that.

00:26:38.216 --> 00:26:40.556 A:middle
We'll give it an initializer

00:26:40.556 --> 00:26:43.766 A:middle
also, and let's give it some

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:45.306 A:middle
basic accessibility like the

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:48.926 A:middle
label and the value.

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:50.476 A:middle
Our label will be dog picker,

00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:52.386 A:middle
and the value will be a

00:26:52.386 --> 00:26:53.476 A:middle
combination of the name of the

00:26:53.476 --> 00:26:55.226 A:middle
dog and it's favorited status.

00:26:55.776 --> 00:26:59.046 A:middle
Okay. Let's get into the

00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.196 A:middle
increment and decrement
