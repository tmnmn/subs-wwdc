00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:00.576 A:middle
font size.

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.216 A:middle
It's contrast ratio of 2.9 to 1

00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:04.676 A:middle
is just too low.

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:09.486 A:middle
And you can use the built-in

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:11.106 A:middle
tool in our accessibility

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:13.926 A:middle
inspector in Xcode to show you

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:15.916 A:middle
what the contrast ratio between

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:17.896 A:middle
a particular color combination

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:19.856 A:middle
is and what text sizes that

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
color combo passes for.

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:22.386 A:middle
And we follow the same

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:23.456 A:middle
guidelines that I mentioned

00:06:23.456 --> 00:06:24.386 A:middle
before in this tool.

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:27.016 A:middle
However, even with a ratio that

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:29.736 A:middle
exceeds the recommended contrast

00:06:29.736 --> 00:06:32.766 A:middle
ratio of 4.5 to 1, for people

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:34.186 A:middle
with low vision conditions,

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:35.906 A:middle
colors that meet the bar can

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:37.216 A:middle
still be problematic when it

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:38.196 A:middle
comes to legibility.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.626 A:middle
So we provide a setting for

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:42.266 A:middle
increasing the contrast across

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:42.826 A:middle
the system.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.016 A:middle
In previous versions of iOS,

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:46.646 A:middle
this setting was referred to as

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:47.616 A:middle
darken colors.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.506 A:middle
So in your code you can use is

00:06:49.506 --> 00:06:51.236 A:middle
darker system colors enabled to

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:51.616 A:middle
check.

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:52.896 A:middle
Though if you're using a

00:06:52.896 --> 00:06:54.696 A:middle
standard UIKit control that you

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:56.516 A:middle
set a tint color on, you will

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:57.786 A:middle
actually get this work for free.

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:00.646 A:middle
On a macOS, you can use
