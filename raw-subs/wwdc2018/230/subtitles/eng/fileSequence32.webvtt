00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:02.716 A:middle
With the references to both the

00:32:02.716 --> 00:32:04.106 A:middle
title and it's corresponding

00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:05.756 A:middle
value, I can now create an

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:07.136 A:middle
accessibility element, which

00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:08.436 A:middle
encompasses the information for

00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:09.000 A:middle
both of these together.

00:32:21.336 --> 00:32:22.216 A:middle
I'll start by creating my

00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:24.006 A:middle
accessibility element here, and

00:32:24.006 --> 00:32:25.456 A:middle
I'll set it's label and it's

00:32:25.456 --> 00:32:27.366 A:middle
accessibility frame to be a

00:32:27.366 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
combination of the corresponding

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:31.066 A:middle
values of both the title and the

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:32.636 A:middle
value.

00:32:33.476 --> 00:32:34.876 A:middle
I'll add this element to my

00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:38.066 A:middle
array of elements, and once I'm

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:40.126 A:middle
done looping over all the title

00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:42.266 A:middle
and value pairs, at the end I'll

00:32:42.266 --> 00:32:43.686 A:middle
set my cache equal to this

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:45.036 A:middle
array, and I'll return these

00:32:45.036 --> 00:32:45.476 A:middle
elements.

00:32:46.056 --> 00:32:48.486 A:middle
One thing we need to remember to

00:32:48.486 --> 00:32:50.356 A:middle
do is to reset our cache every

00:32:50.356 --> 00:32:51.876 A:middle
time the dog object on this gets

00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:53.656 A:middle
updated so that we can compute

00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:54.946 A:middle
the new elements for the new

00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:55.236 A:middle
dog.

00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:58.596 A:middle
To do that, I can simply set it

00:32:58.596 --> 00:32:59.346 A:middle
to no over here.

00:32:59.986 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
And that's it for the dog stats
