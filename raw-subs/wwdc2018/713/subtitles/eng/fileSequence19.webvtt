00:18:59.356 --> 00:19:01.566 A:middle
just like our built-in models

00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:02.826 A:middle
that provide the existing

00:19:02.826 --> 00:19:04.956 A:middle
functionality for NLP.

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:09.696 A:middle
So what will happen is data

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:10.306 A:middle
comes in.

00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:12.976 A:middle
You pass it to Natural Language,

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:16.226 A:middle
which will use that model and do

00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:18.936 A:middle
everything necessary to get all

00:19:18.936 --> 00:19:20.806 A:middle
of the labels out and then pass

00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:22.706 A:middle
back either a label, single

00:19:22.706 --> 00:19:24.196 A:middle
label for a classifier or a

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:27.106 A:middle
sequence of labels for a tagger.

00:19:27.656 --> 00:19:32.316 A:middle
And so how do you do this in

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:33.296 A:middle
Natural Language API?

00:19:34.326 --> 00:19:36.176 A:middle
First thing you have to do is

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.366 A:middle
just locate that model in your

00:19:38.366 --> 00:19:40.296 A:middle
application's resources, and

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:41.636 A:middle
then you create an instance of a

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:43.406 A:middle
class in Natural Language called

00:19:43.456 --> 00:19:45.626 A:middle
ML Model from it.

00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:48.026 A:middle
And then, well, the simplest

00:19:48.026 --> 00:19:49.036 A:middle
thing you can do with it, at

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:51.396 A:middle
least for a classifier, is just

00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:52.976 A:middle
pass it in a chunk of text and

00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:53.756 A:middle
get a label out.

00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:55.886 A:middle
But the more interesting thing

00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:59.116 A:middle
is that you can use these models

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:02.226 A:middle
with NLTagger in exactly the
