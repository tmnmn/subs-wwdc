00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.136 A:middle
supports all the fundamental

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:01.966 A:middle
building blocks that

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:03.866 A:middle
NSLinguisticTagger does but with

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:05.976 A:middle
significantly better and easier

00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:07.516 A:middle
to use APIs.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:09.726 A:middle
In order to provide some of

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:11.336 A:middle
these APIs and go over them, I'm

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:12.346 A:middle
going to illustrate them with

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:13.506 A:middle
hypothetical apps.

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:16.396 A:middle
So the first app that we have

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.356 A:middle
here is an app that you wrote,

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:20.976 A:middle
and as part of the app, you

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.656 A:middle
enable a social messaging or

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:23.936 A:middle
peer-to-peer messaging feature.

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:26.586 A:middle
And an add-on feature in this

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:28.586 A:middle
app that you've created is the

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.446 A:middle
ability to show the right

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:30.966 A:middle
stickers.

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:33.046 A:middle
So based on the content of the

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:34.936 A:middle
message, which in this case is

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:36.116 A:middle
"It's getting late, I'm tired,

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:37.216 A:middle
we'll pick it up tomorrow

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
morning, good night."

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:39.866 A:middle
Your app shows the appropriate

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:40.116 A:middle
sticker.

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.706 A:middle
You parsed this text, and you

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:42.596 A:middle
bring up the sticker.

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.166 A:middle
The user can attach it and send

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:44.976 A:middle
it as a response.

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:46.286 A:middle
So all of this is great.

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:47.376 A:middle
This app has been doing really

00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:47.626 A:middle
well.

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:48.426 A:middle
You've been getting rave

00:03:48.426 --> 00:03:48.936 A:middle
reviews.

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:51.436 A:middle
But you also get feedback that

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:52.776 A:middle
your app is not multilingual.

00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:55.266 A:middle
So it so happens that users are

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.426 A:middle
bilingual these days.

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:57.546 A:middle
They tend to communicate in

00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:59.186 A:middle
several different languages, and

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:00.226 A:middle
your app, when it gets the
