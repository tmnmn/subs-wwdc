00:20:59.886 --> 00:21:01.436 A:middle
return the tags to you and will

00:21:01.436 --> 00:21:03.616 A:middle
do all the other things that

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:05.116 A:middle
NLTagger does automatically,

00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
like language identification,

00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:08.246 A:middle
tokenization and so on and so

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:08.526 A:middle
forth.

00:21:08.526 --> 00:21:12.386 A:middle
So I want to show this to you in

00:21:12.386 --> 00:21:14.016 A:middle
a simple hypothetical example.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.686 A:middle
And this hypothetical example is

00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:21.266 A:middle
an app that users will use to

00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:23.076 A:middle
store bookmarks to articles they

00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:24.526 A:middle
may have run across and then

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:26.056 A:middle
might be intending to read later

00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:26.296 A:middle
on.

00:21:27.236 --> 00:21:28.836 A:middle
But the problem with this

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:29.866 A:middle
application as it currently

00:21:29.866 --> 00:21:32.066 A:middle
stands is that the list of

00:21:32.066 --> 00:21:33.626 A:middle
bookmarks is just one long list

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:34.996 A:middle
with no organization to it.

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:37.176 A:middle
Wouldn't it be nice if we could

00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:39.056 A:middle
automatically classify these

00:21:39.056 --> 00:21:41.046 A:middle
articles and put them into some

00:21:41.046 --> 00:21:42.726 A:middle
organization according to topic?

00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
Well, we can train a classifier

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:46.276 A:middle
to do that for us.

00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:48.346 A:middle
And the other thing is that the

00:21:48.346 --> 00:21:49.526 A:middle
articles, when we look at them,

00:21:49.856 --> 00:21:51.346 A:middle
it's a long stream of text.

00:21:52.386 --> 00:21:53.666 A:middle
Maybe we'd like to highlight

00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:55.966 A:middle
some interesting things in those

00:21:55.966 --> 00:21:58.286 A:middle
articles like for example names.

00:21:58.796 --> 00:22:01.596 A:middle
Well, we have provided built-in
