00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:00.226 A:middle
your app, when it gets the

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:01.886 A:middle
message in Chinese, simply

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:03.886 A:middle
doesn't know what to do with it.

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.246 A:middle
So how can we use natural

00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:06.346 A:middle
language to overcome this

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:06.756 A:middle
problem?

00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:09.816 A:middle
Well, we can do this with two

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.266 A:middle
simple calls to two different

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:11.636 A:middle
APIs.

00:04:12.216 --> 00:04:13.256 A:middle
The first is language

00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:13.986 A:middle
identification.

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:16.106 A:middle
With the new Natural Language

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:17.396 A:middle
framework, you start off by

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:18.696 A:middle
importing Natural Language.

00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:21.226 A:middle
You create an instance of

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.146 A:middle
NLLanguageRecognizer class.

00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:25.456 A:middle
You attach the string that you

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.476 A:middle
would like to process, and you

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:28.676 A:middle
simply call the dominant

00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:29.436 A:middle
language API.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.256 A:middle
Now this will return the single

00:04:32.256 --> 00:04:34.596 A:middle
best hypothesis in terms of

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:35.746 A:middle
language for the string.

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:38.036 A:middle
So the output here is

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:39.446 A:middle
essentially simplified Chinese.

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:41.856 A:middle
Now in Natural Language, we also

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:42.906 A:middle
support a new API.

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:44.766 A:middle
There are instances where you

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:46.046 A:middle
would like to know the top-end

00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:47.506 A:middle
hypothesis for a particular

00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:47.876 A:middle
string.

00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:49.996 A:middle
So you'd like to know what are

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:51.396 A:middle
the top languages along with

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:52.796 A:middle
their associated probabilities.

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.776 A:middle
So you can envision using this

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:55.476 A:middle
in several different

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:56.906 A:middle
applications where there's a lot

00:04:56.906 --> 00:04:58.636 A:middle
of multilinguality, and you want

00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:00.066 A:middle
that leeway in terms of what
