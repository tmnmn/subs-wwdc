00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:00.016 A:middle
So the first of model we're

00:11:00.016 --> 00:11:02.366 A:middle
supporting is a text classifier.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.376 A:middle
A text classifier takes a chunk

00:11:05.376 --> 00:11:07.146 A:middle
of text, maybe it's a sentence

00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:09.126 A:middle
or a paragraph or an entire

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:11.226 A:middle
document, and applies a label to

00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:11.366 A:middle
it.

00:11:11.786 --> 00:11:13.376 A:middle
Examples of this in our existing

00:11:13.376 --> 00:11:15.286 A:middle
APIs are things like language

00:11:15.286 --> 00:11:16.466 A:middle
identification, script

00:11:16.466 --> 00:11:17.216 A:middle
identification.

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:19.436 A:middle
The second type of model we

00:11:19.436 --> 00:11:21.846 A:middle
support is a word tagger, and a

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:23.836 A:middle
word tagger takes a sentence

00:11:23.886 --> 00:11:25.856 A:middle
considered as a sequence of

00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:28.196 A:middle
words, and then applies a label

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:30.386 A:middle
to each word in a sentence in

00:11:30.386 --> 00:11:32.366 A:middle
context, and examples of

00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:34.916 A:middle
existing APIs are things like

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:36.576 A:middle
speech tagging and named entity

00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:37.116 A:middle
recognition.

00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:39.316 A:middle
But those are sort of general

00:11:39.396 --> 00:11:42.656 A:middle
purpose examples of these kinds

00:11:42.656 --> 00:11:43.336 A:middle
of models.

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:45.616 A:middle
You can do a lot more with them

00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:47.236 A:middle
if you have a special purpose

00:11:47.236 --> 00:11:48.446 A:middle
model for your specific

00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:49.006 A:middle
application.

00:11:49.006 --> 00:11:50.036 A:middle
Let me give you some

00:11:50.036 --> 00:11:51.366 A:middle
hypothetical examples.

00:11:51.956 --> 00:11:53.576 A:middle
So, for text classification,

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:55.556 A:middle
suppose you're dealing with user

00:11:55.556 --> 00:11:57.066 A:middle
reviews, and you want to know

00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:59.406 A:middle
automatically whether a given

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:02.016 A:middle
review is a positive review or a
