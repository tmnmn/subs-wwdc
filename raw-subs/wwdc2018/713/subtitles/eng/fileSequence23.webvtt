00:22:59.026 --> 00:23:00.446 A:middle
articles according to topic.

00:23:00.856 --> 00:23:01.896 A:middle
So this is some of what the

00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:03.136 A:middle
training data looks like.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:05.466 A:middle
Each training example is a chunk

00:23:05.466 --> 00:23:07.106 A:middle
of text and the appropriate

00:23:07.106 --> 00:23:10.386 A:middle
label by topic, entertainment,

00:23:10.386 --> 00:23:12.016 A:middle
politics, sports, and so on and

00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:13.026 A:middle
so forth.

00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:18.436 A:middle
And I also have some training

00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:21.486 A:middle
data to train a word tagger that

00:23:21.486 --> 00:23:25.136 A:middle
will recognize product names in

00:23:25.136 --> 00:23:25.836 A:middle
sentences.

00:23:26.256 --> 00:23:27.766 A:middle
So this training data is pretty

00:23:27.766 --> 00:23:28.106 A:middle
simple.

00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:31.486 A:middle
Each example consists of a

00:23:31.486 --> 00:23:32.736 A:middle
sentence considered as a

00:23:32.736 --> 00:23:34.326 A:middle
sequence of tokens and then a

00:23:34.326 --> 00:23:35.936 A:middle
sequence of labels, and each

00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:38.456 A:middle
label is either none, it's not a

00:23:38.456 --> 00:23:40.716 A:middle
product name, or prod, it is a

00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:43.436 A:middle
product name.

00:23:43.696 --> 00:23:46.066 A:middle
So, let's try to train with

00:23:46.106 --> 00:23:46.436 A:middle
these.

00:23:47.186 --> 00:23:50.406 A:middle
So first thing I want to do is

00:23:50.926 --> 00:23:52.726 A:middle
bring up a playground that I

00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:55.786 A:middle
have using Create ML, and this

00:23:55.826 --> 00:23:58.576 A:middle
playground will just load.

00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.826 A:middle
In this case, this is my product
