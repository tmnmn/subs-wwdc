00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:01.516 A:middle
really seriously, and this is a

00:37:01.516 --> 00:37:03.216 A:middle
remarkable opportunity to use

00:37:03.216 --> 00:37:04.456 A:middle
machine learning completely on

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:05.546 A:middle
device to protect user's

00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:05.996 A:middle
privacy.

00:37:06.226 --> 00:37:09.126 A:middle
So in that vein, Natural

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:10.716 A:middle
Language is another step towards

00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:11.976 A:middle
privacy preserving machine

00:37:11.976 --> 00:37:13.556 A:middle
learning but in this case apply

00:37:13.556 --> 00:37:14.846 A:middle
to NLP.

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:19.266 A:middle
So in summary, we talked about a

00:37:19.266 --> 00:37:20.986 A:middle
new framework called Natural

00:37:20.986 --> 00:37:21.746 A:middle
Language framework.

00:37:22.126 --> 00:37:23.726 A:middle
It's tightly integrated with the

00:37:23.726 --> 00:37:24.936 A:middle
Apple machine learning

00:37:24.936 --> 00:37:25.626 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:37:25.626 --> 00:37:27.196 A:middle
You can now train models using

00:37:27.196 --> 00:37:29.536 A:middle
Create ML and then use those

00:37:29.536 --> 00:37:30.906 A:middle
models either with the Core ML

00:37:30.906 --> 00:37:32.816 A:middle
APIs or with Natural Language.

00:37:33.826 --> 00:37:35.446 A:middle
The models that we generate

00:37:35.446 --> 00:37:36.996 A:middle
using Natural Language and the

00:37:36.996 --> 00:37:38.386 A:middle
APIs are highly performed and

00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:40.226 A:middle
optimized on Apple hardware

00:37:40.326 --> 00:37:41.516 A:middle
across all the platforms.

00:37:41.976 --> 00:37:44.866 A:middle
And finally, it supports privacy

00:37:45.026 --> 00:37:46.066 A:middle
because all of the machine

00:37:46.066 --> 00:37:47.706 A:middle
learning in NLP happens on

00:37:47.706 --> 00:37:48.296 A:middle
user's device.

00:37:48.916 --> 00:37:52.076 A:middle
So there's more information

00:37:52.076 --> 00:37:52.376 A:middle
here.

00:37:52.376 --> 00:37:53.836 A:middle
We have a Natural Language lab

00:37:53.836 --> 00:37:55.396 A:middle
tomorrow, so we encourage you to

00:37:55.396 --> 00:37:57.016 A:middle
try out these APIs and come talk

00:37:57.016 --> 00:37:58.726 A:middle
to us and ask us questions about

00:37:58.726 --> 00:38:00.096 A:middle
where you'd like enhancements or
