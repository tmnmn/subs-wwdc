00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.826 A:middle
In this case, this is my product

00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:01.496 A:middle
word tagger.

00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:02.886 A:middle
It'll load the training data,

00:24:03.796 --> 00:24:05.206 A:middle
create a word tagger from it,

00:24:05.886 --> 00:24:07.036 A:middle
and write it out to disk.

00:24:07.036 --> 00:24:08.356 A:middle
So let me just fire that off,

00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:10.626 A:middle
and let it start running.

00:24:11.206 --> 00:24:14.326 A:middle
It's loaded the data, and so

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:16.176 A:middle
under the hood, we automatically

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:17.966 A:middle
handle all of the tokenization,

00:24:17.966 --> 00:24:19.086 A:middle
the feature extraction.

00:24:19.466 --> 00:24:20.316 A:middle
We do the training.

00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:22.596 A:middle
This is a fairly small model, so

00:24:22.596 --> 00:24:24.116 A:middle
it doesn't take all that long to

00:24:24.116 --> 00:24:27.796 A:middle
train, and I have it set to

00:24:27.796 --> 00:24:29.366 A:middle
automatically write my model out

00:24:29.366 --> 00:24:35.956 A:middle
to my desktop, and there it is.

00:24:36.196 --> 00:24:36.486 A:middle
All right.

00:24:36.486 --> 00:24:37.436 A:middle
So that's one model.

00:24:38.636 --> 00:24:40.636 A:middle
Now I have another playground

00:24:40.636 --> 00:24:41.876 A:middle
here that's set up to train my

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:42.786 A:middle
text classifier.

00:24:43.136 --> 00:24:44.076 A:middle
As you can see, it looks very

00:24:44.076 --> 00:24:44.516 A:middle
similar.

00:24:45.046 --> 00:24:47.836 A:middle
Load the training data, create a

00:24:47.836 --> 00:24:49.396 A:middle
text classifier from it, and

00:24:49.396 --> 00:24:50.266 A:middle
write it out to disk.

00:24:51.716 --> 00:24:52.786 A:middle
So I start that off.

00:24:53.426 --> 00:24:56.876 A:middle
And again, automatically natural

00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.006 A:middle
language is loading all the

00:24:58.006 --> 00:25:00.126 A:middle
data, tokenizing it, extracting
