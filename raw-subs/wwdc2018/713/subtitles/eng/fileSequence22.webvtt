00:21:58.796 --> 00:22:01.596 A:middle
Well, we have provided built-in

00:22:01.596 --> 00:22:03.156 A:middle
name identity recognition for

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.666 A:middle
names of people, places, and

00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:07.406 A:middle
organizations, but maybe we also

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:08.426 A:middle
want to highlight names of

00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:10.016 A:middle
products, so we could train a

00:22:10.076 --> 00:22:12.366 A:middle
custom word tagger to identify

00:22:12.366 --> 00:22:14.086 A:middle
those names for us.

00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:16.726 A:middle
So let me go over to the demo

00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:17.086 A:middle
machine.

00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:25.746 A:middle
And so here's our application as

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.586 A:middle
it stands before we apply any

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:29.116 A:middle
natural language processing.

00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:30.706 A:middle
As you can see, even just one

00:22:30.706 --> 00:22:32.736 A:middle
long list of articles on the

00:22:32.736 --> 00:22:35.456 A:middle
side and a big chunk of text for

00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:36.606 A:middle
our article on the right.

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.486 A:middle
Well let's fix that.

00:22:38.716 --> 00:22:42.506 A:middle
So, let's go into -- so the

00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:44.996 A:middle
first part of training a model

00:22:45.516 --> 00:22:48.776 A:middle
is data, and fortunately, I have

00:22:48.776 --> 00:22:49.576 A:middle
some very hard-working

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:50.976 A:middle
colleagues at Apple who have

00:22:50.976 --> 00:22:52.696 A:middle
collected for me some training

00:22:52.696 --> 00:22:54.446 A:middle
data to train two models.

00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:57.066 A:middle
The first model is a text

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:59.026 A:middle
classifier that will classify

00:22:59.026 --> 00:23:00.446 A:middle
articles according to topic.
