00:27:59.936 --> 00:28:01.176 A:middle
those into my application.

00:28:02.116 --> 00:28:05.286 A:middle
Let's take this one and drag it

00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:06.146 A:middle
right in.

00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:14.676 A:middle
Okay. And let's take this one

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:19.786 A:middle
and drag it in, and Xcode will

00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:21.116 A:middle
automatically compile these and

00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:22.546 A:middle
include them in my application.

00:28:22.846 --> 00:28:25.656 A:middle
So all I have to do is build and

00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:25.946 A:middle
run it.

00:28:31.386 --> 00:28:34.336 A:middle
And let's hide that.

00:28:34.926 --> 00:28:36.796 A:middle
Here's my new application, and

00:28:36.796 --> 00:28:38.096 A:middle
you'll notice that my list of

00:28:38.096 --> 00:28:40.386 A:middle
articles is all neatly sorted

00:28:40.506 --> 00:28:47.166 A:middle
automatically by topic, and if I

00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:49.596 A:middle
go in and take a look at one of

00:28:49.596 --> 00:28:51.396 A:middle
these articles, you'll notice

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.556 A:middle
that names are highlighted in

00:28:53.556 --> 00:28:55.296 A:middle
it, and you can see, using our

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:56.566 A:middle
built-in name identity

00:28:56.566 --> 00:28:57.976 A:middle
recognition, we highlight names

00:28:57.976 --> 00:28:59.026 A:middle
of people, places, and

00:28:59.026 --> 00:29:00.806 A:middle
