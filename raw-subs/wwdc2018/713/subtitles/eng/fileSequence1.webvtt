00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:02.206 A:middle
through the NLP APIs available

00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:03.736 A:middle
in NSLinguisticTagger.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:06.706 A:middle
NSLinguisticTagger, as most of

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:07.906 A:middle
you are familiar with or have

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.426 A:middle
used at some point, is a class

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:12.266 A:middle
and foundation that provides the

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:13.636 A:middle
fundamental building blocks for

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:13.916 A:middle
NLP.

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:15.646 A:middle
Everything from language

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:17.376 A:middle
identification to organization,

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.306 A:middle
part of speech tagging, and so

00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:19.973 A:middle
on.

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:21.426 A:middle
We achieve this in

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:23.546 A:middle
NSLinguisticTagger by seamlessly

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:25.346 A:middle
blending linguistics and machine

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.386 A:middle
learning behind the scenes.

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:28.996 A:middle
So you, as a developer, can just

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:30.856 A:middle
focus on using these APIs and

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.206 A:middle
focus on your task.

00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:34.066 A:middle
All that's great.

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:36.016 A:middle
So what's new in NLP for this

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:36.216 A:middle
year?

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:38.346 A:middle
Well, we are delighted to

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:39.356 A:middle
announce that we have a

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:40.816 A:middle
brand-new framework for NLP

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:42.446 A:middle
called Natural Language.

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
Natural Language is now going to

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:47.116 A:middle
be a one-stop shop for doing all

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:49.536 A:middle
things NLP on device across all

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:50.486 A:middle
Apple platforms.

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:52.856 A:middle
Natural Language has some really

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:54.496 A:middle
cool features, and let me talk

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:55.396 A:middle
about each of those.

00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:58.846 A:middle
First, it has a completely

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:01.476 A:middle
redesigned API surface, so it
