00:25:58.366 --> 00:26:00.396 A:middle
Again, I have to find the model

00:26:00.546 --> 00:26:03.366 A:middle
in my bundles resources, create

00:26:03.366 --> 00:26:05.536 A:middle
an NL model for it, and then

00:26:05.536 --> 00:26:07.586 A:middle
create an NLTagger, and this

00:26:07.736 --> 00:26:09.826 A:middle
NLTagger I'm specifying two

00:26:09.826 --> 00:26:10.376 A:middle
schemes.

00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:11.986 A:middle
The first is the built-in name

00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:14.876 A:middle
type scheme to do name identity

00:26:14.876 --> 00:26:16.426 A:middle
recognition, and the second one

00:26:16.426 --> 00:26:18.176 A:middle
is my custom product tag scheme,

00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:19.486 A:middle
and they'll both function in

00:26:19.486 --> 00:26:20.576 A:middle
exactly the same way.

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:23.006 A:middle
And then I just have to tell

00:26:23.096 --> 00:26:24.766 A:middle
that tagger to use my custom

00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:26.866 A:middle
model for my custom scheme.

00:26:27.716 --> 00:26:29.176 A:middle
Now if I supported multiple

00:26:29.176 --> 00:26:30.286 A:middle
languages, I might have more

00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:31.956 A:middle
than one model in here for this

00:26:31.956 --> 00:26:32.216 A:middle
scheme.

00:26:32.806 --> 00:26:38.426 A:middle
And then what I'm going to do is

00:26:38.426 --> 00:26:40.306 A:middle
highlight text in this article

00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:42.466 A:middle
that is located, determined to

00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:43.896 A:middle
be a name of one sort or

00:26:43.896 --> 00:26:44.266 A:middle
another.

00:26:44.566 --> 00:26:46.586 A:middle
So I'm going to get a mutable

00:26:46.586 --> 00:26:47.716 A:middle
attributed string, and I'm going

00:26:47.716 --> 00:26:49.026 A:middle
to add some attributes to it.

00:26:50.106 --> 00:26:51.996 A:middle
So I'll take this string of that

00:26:52.206 --> 00:26:53.246 A:middle
mutable attributed string,

00:26:53.246 --> 00:26:56.196 A:middle
attach that to my tagger, and

00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:57.496 A:middle
then I'm going to do a couple of

00:26:57.496 --> 00:26:59.216 A:middle
enumerations over tags.

00:26:59.676 --> 00:27:01.916 A:middle
The first one uses the built-in
