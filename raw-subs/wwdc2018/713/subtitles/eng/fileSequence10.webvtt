00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.306 A:middle
Well, if that's the case, then

00:10:01.356 --> 00:10:02.566 A:middle
there's at least a reasonable

00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
chance that you can train a

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:08.216 A:middle
machine learning model to do

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:09.686 A:middle
that sort of analysis in your

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:11.206 A:middle
app automatically for you,

00:10:11.646 --> 00:10:14.166 A:middle
giving it examples that it can

00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:16.576 A:middle
train and learn from and produce

00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:18.396 A:middle
a model that can do that

00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:19.156 A:middle
analysis.

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:23.316 A:middle
Now, there are many, many types

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:24.776 A:middle
of machine learning models for

00:10:24.826 --> 00:10:26.176 A:middle
NLP, and there are many

00:10:26.176 --> 00:10:27.206 A:middle
different ways of training it.

00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:28.606 A:middle
Probably many of you are already

00:10:28.606 --> 00:10:29.546 A:middle
training machine learning

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.516 A:middle
models, but our task here has

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:35.286 A:middle
been to produce ways to make

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:36.806 A:middle
this sort of training really,

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:39.056 A:middle
really easy and to make it

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:41.036 A:middle
integrate really well with the

00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:42.696 A:middle
Natural Language framework and

00:10:42.696 --> 00:10:43.146 A:middle
APIs.

00:10:43.556 --> 00:10:45.626 A:middle
So with that in mind, we are

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:47.826 A:middle
supporting two types of models

00:10:48.366 --> 00:10:50.776 A:middle
that we think support a broad

00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:53.016 A:middle
range of functionality and that

00:10:53.016 --> 00:10:55.216 A:middle
work well with our paradigm in

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:57.386 A:middle
NLTagger of applying labels to

00:10:57.386 --> 00:10:58.476 A:middle
pieces of text.

00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:00.016 A:middle
So the first of model we're
