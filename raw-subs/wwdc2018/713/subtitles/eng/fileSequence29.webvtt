organizations, but if you look a

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:03.456 A:middle
little further, you can see that

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:05.696 A:middle
it has used our custom product

00:29:05.696 --> 00:29:07.546 A:middle
tagger to highlight the names of

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:10.056 A:middle
products like iPad, MacBook,

00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:12.386 A:middle
iPad mini, and so forth.

00:29:13.256 --> 00:29:16.606 A:middle
So this shows how easy it is to

00:29:16.606 --> 00:29:18.966 A:middle
train your own custom models and

00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:21.346 A:middle
to use them with the natural

00:29:21.346 --> 00:29:22.866 A:middle
language APIs.

[ Applause ]

00:29:31.046 --> 00:29:32.836 A:middle
So now I'm going to turn things

00:29:32.886 --> 00:29:34.486 A:middle
back over to Vivek to talk about

00:29:34.486 --> 00:29:36.236 A:middle
some important considerations

00:29:36.286 --> 00:29:37.646 A:middle
for training models.

00:29:40.516 --> 00:29:43.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:45.316 A:middle
Thank you, Doug, for telling us

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:46.536 A:middle
how to use these custom NLP

00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:46.966 A:middle
models.

00:29:46.966 --> 00:29:48.646 A:middle
We are really excited to sort of

00:29:48.646 --> 00:29:50.646 A:middle
have a very tight integration of

00:29:50.646 --> 00:29:52.686 A:middle
natural language with Create ML

00:29:52.686 --> 00:29:54.146 A:middle
and the Core ML [inaudible], and

00:29:54.146 --> 00:29:55.246 A:middle
we hope that you do some really

00:29:55.246 --> 00:29:56.416 A:middle
unbelievable things with this

00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:57.316 A:middle
new API.

00:29:57.316 --> 00:30:00.156 A:middle
So I'd like to shift attention
