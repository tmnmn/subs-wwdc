00:32:59.296 --> 00:33:00.056 A:middle
to do other things.

00:33:00.596 --> 00:33:03.976 A:middle
In terms of machine learning

00:33:03.976 --> 00:33:06.586 A:middle
algorithms, we support two

00:33:06.586 --> 00:33:07.516 A:middle
different options.

00:33:07.966 --> 00:33:09.636 A:middle
We can specify this for text

00:33:09.636 --> 00:33:10.216 A:middle
classification.

00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:11.416 A:middle
So for text classification, we

00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:12.486 A:middle
have two different choices.

00:33:12.966 --> 00:33:14.326 A:middle
One is maxEnt, which is an

00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:15.506 A:middle
abbreviation for Maximum

00:33:15.506 --> 00:33:15.956 A:middle
Entropy.

00:33:16.586 --> 00:33:18.596 A:middle
In NLP, we call maxEnt is

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:19.576 A:middle
essentially a multinomial

00:33:19.576 --> 00:33:20.666 A:middle
logistic regression model.

00:33:20.906 --> 00:33:22.326 A:middle
We just call it Maximum Entropy

00:33:22.326 --> 00:33:22.986 A:middle
in NLP feed.

00:33:23.836 --> 00:33:25.666 A:middle
The other one is CRF, which is

00:33:25.666 --> 00:33:27.046 A:middle
an abbreviation for Conditional

00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:27.546 A:middle
Random Feed.

00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:29.606 A:middle
The choice of these two

00:33:29.606 --> 00:33:30.916 A:middle
algorithms really depends upon

00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:31.496 A:middle
your task.

00:33:31.946 --> 00:33:34.026 A:middle
So we encourage you to try both

00:33:34.026 --> 00:33:35.426 A:middle
these options, build the models.

00:33:35.426 --> 00:33:38.556 A:middle
Now in terms of word tagging,

00:33:38.966 --> 00:33:40.316 A:middle
that is one default option,

00:33:40.346 --> 00:33:41.386 A:middle
which is a conditional random

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:41.626 A:middle
feed.

00:33:41.996 --> 00:33:43.496 A:middle
When you instantiate an ML word

00:33:43.566 --> 00:33:46.146 A:middle
tagger, specify data to it, the

00:33:46.146 --> 00:33:48.176 A:middle
default model that you get is a

00:33:48.176 --> 00:33:49.096 A:middle
conditional random feed.

00:33:49.956 --> 00:33:51.686 A:middle
Now as I mentioned, the choice

00:33:51.686 --> 00:33:52.736 A:middle
of these algorithms really

00:33:52.736 --> 00:33:54.626 A:middle
depends on your task, but what

00:33:54.626 --> 00:33:56.626 A:middle
I'd like to emphasize is sort of

00:33:56.626 --> 00:33:58.196 A:middle
draw [inaudible] between your

00:33:58.196 --> 00:33:59.536 A:middle
conventional development

00:33:59.536 --> 00:33:59.996 A:middle
process.
