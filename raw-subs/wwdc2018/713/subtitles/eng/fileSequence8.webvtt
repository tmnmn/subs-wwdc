00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:01.386 A:middle
search experience in your app.

00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:04.976 A:middle
So there's a lot more

00:08:04.976 --> 00:08:06.256 A:middle
information about how to use

00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:06.666 A:middle
these APIs.

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:07.906 A:middle
You can go to the developer

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.326 A:middle
documentation and find more

00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:09.936 A:middle
information.

00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:11.926 A:middle
What I'd like to emphasize here

00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:15.106 A:middle
is NSLinguisticTagger is still

00:08:15.106 --> 00:08:17.006 A:middle
supported, but the future of NLP

00:08:17.006 --> 00:08:18.596 A:middle
is in Natural Language.

00:08:18.596 --> 00:08:20.296 A:middle
So we recommend that and

00:08:20.296 --> 00:08:22.026 A:middle
encourage you to move to Natural

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:23.566 A:middle
Language so that you can get all

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:24.896 A:middle
the latest functionalities of

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:26.226 A:middle
NLP in this framework.

00:08:26.996 --> 00:08:29.616 A:middle
Now let's shift gears and look

00:08:29.616 --> 00:08:31.996 A:middle
at a situation where you have an

00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:34.525 A:middle
idea for an app, or you need a

00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:36.376 A:middle
functionality within your app

00:08:36.376 --> 00:08:37.666 A:middle
that Natural Language does not

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:38.076 A:middle
support.

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:40.106 A:middle
What do you do?

00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:42.876 A:middle
So you can certainly create

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:44.936 A:middle
something, which will be great,

00:08:45.306 --> 00:08:46.356 A:middle
but what if we gave you the

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:48.176 A:middle
tools to make that much easier?

00:08:50.756 --> 00:08:53.376 A:middle
To talk about custom NLP models

00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:54.656 A:middle
and how to build custom NLP

00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:56.766 A:middle
models using Create ML and use

00:08:56.766 --> 00:08:58.706 A:middle
the subsequent models, which are

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.126 A:middle
essentially Code ML models in
