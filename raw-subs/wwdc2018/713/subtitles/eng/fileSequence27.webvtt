00:26:59.676 --> 00:27:01.916 A:middle
The first one uses the built-in

00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:03.926 A:middle
name-type scheme for name

00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:05.576 A:middle
identity recognition of people,

00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:07.576 A:middle
places, and organizations, and

00:27:07.576 --> 00:27:08.686 A:middle
if I find something that's

00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:11.436 A:middle
tagged as a person or place or

00:27:11.436 --> 00:27:13.226 A:middle
organization, then I'm going to

00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:14.946 A:middle
add an attribute to the

00:27:14.946 --> 00:27:17.326 A:middle
attributed string that will give

00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:17.976 A:middle
it some color.

00:27:20.256 --> 00:27:21.576 A:middle
And then we can do exactly the

00:27:21.576 --> 00:27:23.696 A:middle
same thing with our custom

00:27:23.696 --> 00:27:24.046 A:middle
model.

00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:26.336 A:middle
We're going to enumerate using

00:27:26.336 --> 00:27:28.176 A:middle
our custom product tag scheme,

00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:31.386 A:middle
and in that case, if we find

00:27:31.386 --> 00:27:32.516 A:middle
something that's labeled with

00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:34.586 A:middle
our custom product tag, then I

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
can add color to it in exactly

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:37.786 A:middle
the same way.

00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:41.026 A:middle
So you can use custom models

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:44.326 A:middle
with Natural Language API just

00:27:44.516 --> 00:27:45.916 A:middle
in the same way that you use

00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:46.916 A:middle
built-in models.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:48.736 A:middle
Now, let's go back to our

00:27:48.736 --> 00:27:50.936 A:middle
playground, and we see that the

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:52.986 A:middle
model training has finished, and

00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:54.496 A:middle
in fact there are now two models

00:27:54.496 --> 00:27:55.996 A:middle
showing up on my desktop.

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:59.936 A:middle
So all I need to do is drag

00:27:59.936 --> 00:28:01.176 A:middle
those into my application.
