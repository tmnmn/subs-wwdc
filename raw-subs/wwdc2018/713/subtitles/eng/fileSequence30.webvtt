00:29:57.316 --> 00:30:00.156 A:middle
So I'd like to shift attention

00:30:00.156 --> 00:30:01.406 A:middle
now again and talk about

00:30:01.406 --> 00:30:01.996 A:middle
performance.

00:30:02.446 --> 00:30:04.106 A:middle
So as I mentioned before,

00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:05.656 A:middle
Natural Language is available

00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:08.166 A:middle
across all Apple platforms, and

00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.226 A:middle
it also offers you what we call

00:30:10.226 --> 00:30:12.296 A:middle
as standardized text processing.

00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:14.296 A:middle
So let's take a moment again to

00:30:14.296 --> 00:30:15.636 A:middle
understand what we mean by this.

00:30:16.426 --> 00:30:17.686 A:middle
Now if you were to look at a

00:30:17.686 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
conventional machine learning

00:30:18.876 --> 00:30:20.786 A:middle
pipeline that didn't use Create

00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:22.236 A:middle
ML, where would you start?

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:23.526 A:middle
You would start with some amount

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:24.336 A:middle
of training data.

00:30:25.346 --> 00:30:26.136 A:middle
You would take this training

00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:26.426 A:middle
data.

00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:27.436 A:middle
You would tokenize this data.

00:30:27.436 --> 00:30:28.716 A:middle
You'd probably extract some

00:30:28.716 --> 00:30:29.246 A:middle
features.

00:30:29.506 --> 00:30:30.896 A:middle
This is really important for

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:32.076 A:middle
languages like Chinese and

00:30:32.076 --> 00:30:33.676 A:middle
Japanese where tokenization is

00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:34.286 A:middle
very important.

00:30:34.926 --> 00:30:36.386 A:middle
You would throw that into your

00:30:36.386 --> 00:30:37.236 A:middle
favorite machine learning

00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:40.236 A:middle
toolkit, and you'd get a machine

00:30:40.236 --> 00:30:41.516 A:middle
learning model out of it.

00:30:41.966 --> 00:30:43.226 A:middle
Now in order to use that machine

00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:44.196 A:middle
learning model on an Apple

00:30:44.196 --> 00:30:45.756 A:middle
device, you'd have to convert

00:30:45.756 --> 00:30:47.146 A:middle
that into a Core ML model.

00:30:47.606 --> 00:30:48.736 A:middle
So what would you do?

00:30:48.906 --> 00:30:49.716 A:middle
You would use a Core ML

00:30:49.716 --> 00:30:50.746 A:middle
converter to do this.

00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:53.176 A:middle
This is sort of the training

00:30:53.176 --> 00:30:55.426 A:middle
procedure in order to get from

00:30:55.426 --> 00:30:57.386 A:middle
data to a model and deploy it on

00:30:57.386 --> 00:30:59.896 A:middle
an Apple device.

00:30:59.896 --> 00:31:02.486 A:middle
Now, at inference time, what you
