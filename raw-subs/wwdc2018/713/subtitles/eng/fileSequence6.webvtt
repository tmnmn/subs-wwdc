00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.456 A:middle
Now let's look at a different

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:01.046 A:middle
sort of an API.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:02.206 A:middle
I mean language identification

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:03.586 A:middle
and tokenization are good, but

00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:05.406 A:middle
we would also like to use auto

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:06.636 A:middle
speech tagging, named entity

00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:07.746 A:middle
recognition, and so on.

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:09.616 A:middle
So let me illustrate how to use

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:10.936 A:middle
named entity recognition API

00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:14.106 A:middle
again with the hypothetical app.

00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:15.276 A:middle
So here's an app.

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:17.026 A:middle
It's a news recommendation app.

00:06:17.646 --> 00:06:18.906 A:middle
So as part of this app, your

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:20.576 A:middle
user has been going and reading

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:21.906 A:middle
a lot of things about the royal

00:06:21.906 --> 00:06:23.206 A:middle
wedding, so a really curious

00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:23.456 A:middle
user.

00:06:23.456 --> 00:06:24.326 A:middle
They want to find everything

00:06:24.326 --> 00:06:25.076 A:middle
about the royal wedding.

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:26.806 A:middle
So they've perused a lot of

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:28.886 A:middle
pages in your app, and then they

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:30.556 A:middle
go on to the search bar, and

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.556 A:middle
they type Harry.

00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
And what they see is completely

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:35.756 A:middle
things that are not pertinent to

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:37.026 A:middle
what they've been looking for.

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:38.686 A:middle
You get Harry Potter and so on

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:39.246 A:middle
and so forth.

00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:42.376 A:middle
What you'd like to see is Prince

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.036 A:middle
Harry, something related to the

00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:44.716 A:middle
royal wedding.

00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:46.656 A:middle
So now you can overcome this

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.436 A:middle
issue in your app by using the

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.056 A:middle
name entity recognition API.

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:52.776 A:middle
Again, as I mentioned, the

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:54.346 A:middle
syntax here is very familiar.

00:06:54.586 --> 00:06:56.006 A:middle
Those of you who have been used

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:57.506 A:middle
to using NSLinguisticTagger,

00:06:57.776 --> 00:06:58.836 A:middle
they should look familiar and

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.276 A:middle
feel familiar, but it's much
