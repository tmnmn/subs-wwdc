&gt;&gt; Hello and good afternoon

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.406 A:middle
everyone.

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:29.096 A:middle
Welcome to our session on

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.336 A:middle
natural language processing.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:32.226 A:middle
I'm delighted to see so many of

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:33.836 A:middle
you here today, and I'm really

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:35.356 A:middle
excited to tell you about some

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:36.896 A:middle
of the new and cool features

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:38.206 A:middle
we've been working in the NLP

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:39.526 A:middle
space for you.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.066 A:middle
I'm Vivek, and I'll be jointly

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.526 A:middle
presenting this session with my

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:44.676 A:middle
colleague, Doug Davidson.

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:47.756 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.646 A:middle
Last year, we placed your app

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:52.166 A:middle
center stage and told you how

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.336 A:middle
you could harness the power of

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:56.426 A:middle
NLP to make your apps smarter

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:57.186 A:middle
and more intelligent.

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.926 A:middle
We did this by walking you
