00:35:59.446 --> 00:36:01.306 A:middle
robust enough to handle it.

00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:02.646 A:middle
That's a question that you ought

00:36:02.646 --> 00:36:03.366 A:middle
to ask yourself.

00:36:04.006 --> 00:36:06.066 A:middle
And the final step is well in a

00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:07.156 A:middle
conventional development

00:36:07.156 --> 00:36:09.086 A:middle
workflow you write patches, you

00:36:09.086 --> 00:36:11.516 A:middle
fix bugs, and you update your

00:36:11.516 --> 00:36:11.656 A:middle
app.

00:36:12.406 --> 00:36:13.576 A:middle
How do you do that with machine

00:36:13.576 --> 00:36:13.846 A:middle
learning?

00:36:14.096 --> 00:36:17.686 A:middle
Well, the way to do that or fix

00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:19.416 A:middle
issues with machine learning is

00:36:19.416 --> 00:36:21.276 A:middle
to find out where your models do

00:36:21.276 --> 00:36:22.876 A:middle
not perform well, and you have

00:36:22.876 --> 00:36:24.076 A:middle
to supplement it with the right

00:36:24.076 --> 00:36:24.706 A:middle
sort of data.

00:36:25.206 --> 00:36:26.776 A:middle
By adding data and retraining

00:36:26.776 --> 00:36:28.346 A:middle
your model, you can essentially

00:36:28.346 --> 00:36:29.716 A:middle
get a new model out.

00:36:29.716 --> 00:36:31.046 A:middle
So it's, as I mentioned, it's

00:36:31.046 --> 00:36:32.266 A:middle
very similar to sort of the

00:36:32.266 --> 00:36:34.196 A:middle
development workflow, and they

00:36:34.266 --> 00:36:34.676 A:middle
are very [inaudible].

00:36:34.676 --> 00:36:36.306 A:middle
So you can think of it as part

00:36:36.306 --> 00:36:37.786 A:middle
of your fabric if you're

00:36:38.176 --> 00:36:39.466 A:middle
employing machine learning

00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:40.906 A:middle
models as part of your app, you

00:36:40.906 --> 00:36:42.596 A:middle
can just combine it with the

00:36:42.596 --> 00:36:43.506 A:middle
word process itself.

00:36:44.006 --> 00:36:46.876 A:middle
The last thing I'd like to

00:36:46.876 --> 00:36:48.736 A:middle
emphasize here is privacy.

00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:50.706 A:middle
So everything that you saw in

00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:53.086 A:middle
this session, all of the machine

00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:54.576 A:middle
learning and Natural Language

00:36:54.576 --> 00:36:56.726 A:middle
processing happens completely on

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:57.146 A:middle
device.

00:36:57.946 --> 00:36:59.246 A:middle
So we at Apple take privacy

00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:01.516 A:middle
really seriously, and this is a
