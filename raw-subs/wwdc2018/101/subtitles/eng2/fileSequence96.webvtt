01:35:59.576 --> 01:36:02.396 A:middle
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

01:36:03.506 --> 01:36:05.636 A:middle
And we want as many Mac users as

01:36:05.676 --> 01:36:07.186 A:middle
possible to have access to our

01:36:07.186 --> 01:36:09.126 A:middle
latest software, and that's why

01:36:09.286 --> 01:36:10.876 A:middle
six years ago with the

01:36:10.876 --> 01:36:13.156 A:middle
introduction of OS 10 Mavericks,

01:36:13.486 --> 01:36:15.096 A:middle
we began offering our macOS

01:36:15.096 --> 01:36:17.566 A:middle
updates free for Mac users.

01:36:17.566 --> 01:36:19.656 A:middle
And 2013 was also the year that

01:36:19.656 --> 01:36:21.236 A:middle
we first introduced our

01:36:21.236 --> 01:36:23.106 A:middle
California naming theme.

01:36:24.036 --> 01:36:25.986 A:middle
Now after spending a year by the

01:36:25.986 --> 01:36:28.036 A:middle
ocean, we not only modernized

01:36:28.076 --> 01:36:29.876 A:middle
the look and feel of macOS, but

01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:32.206 A:middle
we headed to the mountains with

01:36:32.206 --> 01:36:34.016 A:middle
macOS Yosemite.

01:36:35.266 --> 01:36:38.076 A:middle
Now, as you may be aware, our

01:36:38.076 --> 01:36:39.646 A:middle
naming of Mac releases is

01:36:39.646 --> 01:36:41.616 A:middle
handled by our crack marketing

01:36:41.616 --> 01:36:44.766 A:middle
organization, and as you've

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:46.456 A:middle
probably noticed, they went on a

01:36:46.736 --> 01:36:49.006 A:middle
four-year mountain-bound bender.

01:36:50.936 --> 01:36:52.176 A:middle
[laughter] In El Capitan we

01:36:52.176 --> 01:36:54.336 A:middle
added metal, our ground-breaking

01:36:54.336 --> 01:36:55.626 A:middle
graphics technology.

01:36:56.136 --> 01:36:57.696 A:middle
In Sierra, we brought Siri to

01:36:57.696 --> 01:36:58.936 A:middle
the Mac and extended our

01:36:58.936 --> 01:37:00.706 A:middle
capabilities and continuity.
