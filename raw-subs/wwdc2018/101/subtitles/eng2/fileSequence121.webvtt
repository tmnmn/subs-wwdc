02:00:58.956 --> 02:01:00.886 A:middle
performance and realism in 3D

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.386 A:middle
rendering and gaming.

02:01:02.846 --> 02:01:04.276 A:middle
Now this beautiful forest you

02:01:04.276 --> 02:01:06.106 A:middle
see here, this isn't a video

02:01:06.106 --> 02:01:06.686 A:middle
capture.

02:01:07.346 --> 02:01:09.676 A:middle
This is from Unity's new Book of

02:01:09.676 --> 02:01:11.606 A:middle
the Dead interactive demo, and

02:01:11.606 --> 02:01:13.816 A:middle
it's being rendered live right

02:01:13.866 --> 02:01:16.956 A:middle
now on a MacBook with an eGPU

02:01:16.956 --> 02:01:18.546 A:middle
powering this display.

02:01:18.646 --> 02:01:19.796 A:middle
I mean doesn't this look

02:01:19.796 --> 02:01:19.976 A:middle
amazing?

02:01:20.516 --> 02:01:25.206 A:middle
[ Applause ]

02:01:25.706 --> 02:01:26.966 A:middle
Now, of course because this is

02:01:27.026 --> 02:01:28.986 A:middle
rendered live, we can check

02:01:29.016 --> 02:01:30.436 A:middle
what's up ahead, so let's start

02:01:30.436 --> 02:01:30.796 A:middle
walking.

02:01:32.206 --> 02:01:33.726 A:middle
Now Unity is using Metal's

02:01:33.956 --> 02:01:36.586 A:middle
unified graphics and compute to

02:01:36.646 --> 02:01:39.076 A:middle
generate real-time lighting and

02:01:39.106 --> 02:01:41.556 A:middle
complex post-processing effects.

02:01:43.186 --> 02:01:46.696 A:middle
So cool. And that's all rendered

02:01:46.816 --> 02:01:49.096 A:middle
live on a MacBook running with

02:01:49.096 --> 02:01:50.096 A:middle
an eGPU.

02:01:50.096 --> 02:01:50.976 A:middle
It's pretty great.

02:01:51.516 --> 02:01:56.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

02:01:57.046 --> 02:01:58.056 A:middle
Now another place where we're

02:01:58.056 --> 02:01:59.356 A:middle
doing incredible acceleration

02:01:59.356 --> 02:02:01.366 A:middle
with Metal is in machine
