The next release of iOS is, you

00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:05.086 A:middle
guessed it, iOS 12.

00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:08.416 A:middle
Now, our customers, of course,

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:10.936 A:middle
are going to receive iOS 12 as a

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:12.786 A:middle
free software update.

00:10:13.326 --> 00:10:15.296 A:middle
Now, it's easy to forget now,

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:17.456 A:middle
but iOS pioneered this approach

00:10:17.506 --> 00:10:18.816 A:middle
of helping you get more out of

00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:20.476 A:middle
the device you already own

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:21.826 A:middle
through free updates.

00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:23.116 A:middle
And some of those updates have

00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:24.466 A:middle
been really quite profound.

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:27.116 A:middle
Like the App Store, giving us a

00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:29.116 A:middle
whole new way to discover and

00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:29.946 A:middle
download apps.

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:31.866 A:middle
It itself was delivered via

00:10:31.906 --> 00:10:33.666 A:middle
software update, as were the

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:35.546 A:middle
folders we used to organize

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:36.196 A:middle
those apps.

00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:38.076 A:middle
And can you imagine living

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:41.026 A:middle
without Find My iPhone or

00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:42.786 A:middle
iMessage with its end-to-end

00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:44.796 A:middle
securely encrypted messaging.

00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:47.196 A:middle
Or the revolution in iPad

00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:49.356 A:middle
productivity with Slide Over,

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:52.586 A:middle
Split View, and Drag and Drop,

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:54.806 A:middle
or AR, changing the way we

00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:56.426 A:middle
interact with the world around

00:10:56.426 --> 00:10:58.666 A:middle
us, all delivered via software

00:10:58.666 --> 00:10:59.176 A:middle
updates.

00:10:59.176 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
And of course we want to get
