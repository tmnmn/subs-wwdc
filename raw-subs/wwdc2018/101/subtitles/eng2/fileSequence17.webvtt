00:16:59.816 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
USDZ format.

00:17:01.606 --> 00:17:02.816 A:middle
It's actually a pretty big deal.

00:17:02.816 --> 00:17:05.915 A:middle
There is now a way to deliver AR

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:08.356 A:middle
experiences across the entire

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:09.226 A:middle
iOS experience.

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:13.086 A:middle
And so today we are actually

00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:15.396 A:middle
announcing that we are going to

00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:17.665 A:middle
bring native USDZ support to

00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:18.976 A:middle
Adobe's Creative Cloud.

00:17:19.516 --> 00:17:22.915 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:26.126 A:middle
With Creative Cloud, designers

00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:28.086 A:middle
and developers will now be able

00:17:28.086 --> 00:17:30.686 A:middle
to use familiar apps, apps that

00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:31.886 A:middle
they know and love, like

00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:33.886 A:middle
Photoshop or Dimension, to

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.436 A:middle
create amazing AR content and

00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:38.596 A:middle
bring it easily via USDZ.

00:17:38.596 --> 00:17:41.506 A:middle
And of course, we are not going

00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:42.296 A:middle
to stop there.

00:17:42.906 --> 00:17:44.356 A:middle
We are going to bring the power

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.186 A:middle
of immersive design to Creative

00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:48.706 A:middle
Cloud with a new set of services

00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:50.726 A:middle
and applications including a

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:53.006 A:middle
brand-new iOS application that's

00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:55.316 A:middle
going to let all of you design

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.226 A:middle
amazing AR experiences quickly.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.526 A:middle
So, you will be able to bring in
