01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.546 A:middle
making for an even more powerful

01:14:01.546 --> 01:14:03.116 A:middle
Siri watch phase.

01:14:04.286 --> 01:14:06.306 A:middle
Now currently to talk to Siri

01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:07.236 A:middle
you raise your wrist and you

01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:08.386 A:middle
say, hey Siri.

01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:09.576 A:middle
And when you think about this,

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:10.896 A:middle
it's quite a strong signal when

01:14:10.896 --> 01:14:12.166 A:middle
you raise your wrist and talk to

01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:12.836 A:middle
your watch.

01:14:12.836 --> 01:14:13.746 A:middle
It's kind of like when someone's

01:14:13.746 --> 01:14:14.796 A:middle
standing right in front of you,

01:14:14.966 --> 01:14:15.766 A:middle
you don't need to say hey

01:14:15.766 --> 01:14:16.676 A:middle
because you have their attention

01:14:16.676 --> 01:14:18.486 A:middle
already, so we're bringing this

01:14:18.486 --> 01:14:20.636 A:middle
same social cue to Siri on the

01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:23.116 A:middle
watch so you no longer need to

01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:23.856 A:middle
say, hey Siri.

01:14:24.886 --> 01:14:26.046 A:middle
You just raise your wrist and

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:26.596 A:middle
talk to Siri.

01:14:32.316 --> 01:14:32.776 A:middle
[applause] Now we're also

01:14:32.776 --> 01:14:33.376 A:middle
bringing a number of

01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:34.956 A:middle
improvements to Notifications,

01:14:35.306 --> 01:14:36.536 A:middle
which are now more actionable

01:14:36.536 --> 01:14:37.246 A:middle
and interactive.

01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:38.906 A:middle
So, for example, with this

01:14:38.906 --> 01:14:40.516 A:middle
notification from Quantis, you

01:14:40.516 --> 01:14:41.556 A:middle
can check in and share your

01:14:41.556 --> 01:14:42.856 A:middle
flight details right from the

01:14:42.856 --> 01:14:43.646 A:middle
notification.

01:14:44.516 --> 01:14:45.536 A:middle
After you finish a ride with

01:14:45.536 --> 01:14:47.136 A:middle
Dee, you can scroll down.

01:14:47.256 --> 01:14:48.646 A:middle
You can rate your ride and pay

01:14:48.646 --> 01:14:50.256 A:middle
with Apple Pay right there in

01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:51.016 A:middle
the notification.

01:14:51.856 --> 01:14:53.076 A:middle
And with this one from Yelp that

01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:54.356 A:middle
your table is ready, if you need

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.616 A:middle
a bit more time, you can extend

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:56.916 A:middle
the reservation out a bit just

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:57.576 A:middle
by tapping here.

01:14:58.116 --> 01:14:59.556 A:middle
So super easy now to interact

01:14:59.556 --> 01:15:00.506 A:middle
right in place inside
