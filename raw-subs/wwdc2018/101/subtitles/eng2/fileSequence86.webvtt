01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:02.486 A:middle
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you

01:26:02.486 --> 01:26:04.626 A:middle
the latest in audio technology,

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:07.976 A:middle
Dolby Atmos.

01:26:10.516 --> 01:26:15.116 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:26:15.616 --> 01:26:18.316 A:middle
With Atmos, you get room-filling

01:26:18.316 --> 01:26:18.806 A:middle
sound.

01:26:19.106 --> 01:26:20.636 A:middle
The perfect complement to the

01:26:20.686 --> 01:26:23.066 A:middle
stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K.

01:26:23.736 --> 01:26:25.806 A:middle
Now what makes Atmos so special

01:26:26.396 --> 01:26:27.786 A:middle
is that unlike a traditional

01:26:27.846 --> 01:26:28.946 A:middle
surround sound setup, where

01:26:28.946 --> 01:26:30.366 A:middle
sound is assigned to channels

01:26:30.366 --> 01:26:31.536 A:middle
like the left or the right,

01:26:32.876 --> 01:26:34.676 A:middle
Dolby Atmos has the ability to

01:26:34.676 --> 01:26:36.726 A:middle
completely immerse you.

01:26:37.236 --> 01:26:38.786 A:middle
Atmos moves sound in

01:26:38.786 --> 01:26:39.966 A:middle
three-dimensional space,

01:26:40.396 --> 01:26:41.756 A:middle
creating an experience with

01:26:41.836 --> 01:26:44.006 A:middle
powerful audio that flows all

01:26:44.006 --> 01:26:44.406 A:middle
around you.

01:26:45.026 --> 01:26:46.686 A:middle
It puts you right in the center

01:26:46.686 --> 01:26:47.346 A:middle
of the action.

01:26:48.406 --> 01:26:50.116 A:middle
All this with a home theater

01:26:50.116 --> 01:26:52.376 A:middle
setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos

01:26:52.376 --> 01:26:54.566 A:middle
enabled soundbar and an Apple TV

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:54.956 A:middle
4K.

01:26:55.786 --> 01:26:58.556 A:middle
In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only

01:26:58.556 --> 01:26:59.766 A:middle
streaming player to be both

01:26:59.816 --> 01:27:01.436 A:middle
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos
