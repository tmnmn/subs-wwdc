01:42:59.586 --> 01:43:01.066 A:middle
Actions that you act on the

01:43:01.066 --> 01:43:02.126 A:middle
current photo.

01:43:02.356 --> 01:43:03.586 A:middle
So, for instance, if I have a

01:43:03.586 --> 01:43:05.326 A:middle
photo like this and I want to

01:43:05.326 --> 01:43:07.026 A:middle
edit it, I don't have to open it

01:43:07.026 --> 01:43:07.956 A:middle
and go through a new app.

01:43:08.486 --> 01:43:10.476 A:middle
I can rotate it right here

01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:12.446 A:middle
inside the finder.

01:43:12.706 --> 01:43:14.076 A:middle
It's really powerful.

01:43:14.266 --> 01:43:15.786 A:middle
Now this sidebar is available in

01:43:15.786 --> 01:43:16.916 A:middle
other views of the finder.

01:43:17.336 --> 01:43:18.486 A:middle
So for instance, I'm just going

01:43:18.486 --> 01:43:19.746 A:middle
to bring up the preview pane

01:43:19.746 --> 01:43:21.106 A:middle
here, and I'm going to do a

01:43:21.106 --> 01:43:25.136 A:middle
multi selection of a PDF as well

01:43:25.136 --> 01:43:27.116 A:middle
as several images, and you'll

01:43:27.116 --> 01:43:28.366 A:middle
notice that the quick actions

01:43:28.366 --> 01:43:30.566 A:middle
area is contextual, so it shows

01:43:30.566 --> 01:43:32.716 A:middle
me create PDF as an option.

01:43:33.126 --> 01:43:34.406 A:middle
I'm going to click create PDF,

01:43:34.406 --> 01:43:36.176 A:middle
and it's going to assemble all

01:43:36.176 --> 01:43:38.256 A:middle
of these photos into a PDF just

01:43:38.256 --> 01:43:39.406 A:middle
like that.

01:43:39.406 --> 01:43:41.306 A:middle
But what's really great is these

01:43:41.306 --> 01:43:43.496 A:middle
actions are also customizable,

01:43:43.936 --> 01:43:45.396 A:middle
so you can create automator

01:43:45.396 --> 01:43:47.446 A:middle
actions and assign them to

01:43:47.446 --> 01:43:50.036 A:middle
buttons here inside of Finder.

01:43:50.546 --> 01:43:51.616 A:middle
So you'll notice that now that I

01:43:51.616 --> 01:43:53.596 A:middle
have this PDF selected, I have

01:43:53.596 --> 01:43:55.426 A:middle
an option to run a custom

01:43:55.426 --> 01:43:56.576 A:middle
automator action that I've

01:43:56.576 --> 01:43:58.526 A:middle
created called Watermark PDF.

01:43:59.526 --> 01:44:01.256 A:middle
When I click it, my custom
