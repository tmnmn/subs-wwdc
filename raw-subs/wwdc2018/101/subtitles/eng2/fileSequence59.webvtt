the members of the Facetime

00:59:28.556 --> 00:59:30.416 A:middle

they're already on a group

00:59:31.256 --> 00:59:33.506 A:middle
Facetime call, so I'm just going

00:59:33.996 --> 00:59:39.036 A:middle
to join right in.

00:59:39.996 --> 00:59:40.636 A:middle
Hey everybody.

00:59:41.556 --> 00:59:42.666 A:middle

UI with these big gorgeous tiles

00:59:49.606 --> 00:59:51.196 A:middle
right up front where you see

some of the leaders of the

00:59:52.436 --> 00:59:53.816 A:middle
Facetime team, and down at the

bottom there's and area we call

00:59:55.586 --> 00:59:57.226 A:middle
the roster that contains

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:57.906 A:middle
everybody else.
