better experiences for our

customers to help them live a

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:05.396 A:middle
better day.

00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:08.266 A:middle
And these experiences of course

00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:09.996 A:middle
are expressed through our four

00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:11.736 A:middle
amazing platforms.

iOS.

00:09:25.016 --> 00:09:26.936 A:middle
