01:38:00.656 --> 01:38:00.726 A:middle
now.

01:38:02.796 --> 01:38:05.846 A:middle
So here we are live in macOS

01:38:06.196 --> 01:38:08.536 A:middle
Mojave, and I'd like to show you

01:38:09.276 --> 01:38:11.006 A:middle
a new side of Mojave.

01:38:12.056 --> 01:38:14.216 A:middle
We call it dark mode.

01:38:15.516 --> 01:38:22.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:38:23.276 --> 01:38:25.476 A:middle
And as you see, dark mode is not

01:38:25.476 --> 01:38:27.096 A:middle
just about the dock or the menu

01:38:27.096 --> 01:38:27.386 A:middle
bar.

01:38:27.386 --> 01:38:28.506 A:middle
It extends to your Windows

01:38:28.506 --> 01:38:30.146 A:middle
Chrome, your sidebar, and even

01:38:30.146 --> 01:38:32.196 A:middle
the content of the Windows, and

01:38:32.196 --> 01:38:33.526 A:middle
it's so great for Pros.

01:38:33.526 --> 01:38:35.256 A:middle
It makes photographic content

01:38:35.706 --> 01:38:38.356 A:middle
absolutely pop off the screen.

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.116 A:middle
It's just gorgeous.

01:38:40.896 --> 01:38:44.116 A:middle
It's so nice.

01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:46.386 A:middle
And this is great not just for

01:38:46.386 --> 01:38:48.636 A:middle
photography but when working on

01:38:48.726 --> 01:38:51.076 A:middle
presentations or documents.

01:38:51.586 --> 01:38:53.106 A:middle
It's also great doing ordinary

01:38:53.166 --> 01:38:53.506 A:middle
things.

01:38:53.566 --> 01:38:54.706 A:middle
Maybe you're working in a dark

01:38:54.706 --> 01:38:55.246 A:middle
environment.

01:38:55.786 --> 01:38:57.166 A:middle
Just look at calendar.

01:38:58.166 --> 01:39:00.736 A:middle
Even mail in dark mode.
