00:26:57.656 --> 00:27:00.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, that doesn't look too

00:27:00.336 --> 00:27:00.426 A:middle
good.

00:27:00.426 --> 00:27:01.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Anders, I've got a situation.

00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:04.236 A:middle
I'm going to need your help over

00:27:04.236 --> 00:27:04.716 A:middle
here.

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:05.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, okay.

00:27:05.446 --> 00:27:06.686 A:middle
I've got a firetruck.

00:27:06.686 --> 00:27:06.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:27:07.606 --> 00:27:09.026 A:middle
You put out those flames while--

00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.246 A:middle
oh, oh dear.

00:27:10.806 --> 00:27:11.666 A:middle
Somebody's got themselves

00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:13.786 A:middle
trapped on the roof, so I'm

00:27:13.886 --> 00:27:15.326 A:middle
going to use this helicopter to

00:27:16.276 --> 00:27:18.286 A:middle
go and pick up these clowns.

00:27:19.176 --> 00:27:21.516 A:middle
[music] How are you getting on

00:27:22.036 --> 00:27:23.186 A:middle
down there Anders?

00:27:23.456 --> 00:27:25.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm almost done, almost done.

00:27:26.366 --> 00:27:27.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Those guys are safe.

00:27:27.966 --> 00:27:30.456 A:middle
And the flames look like they're

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:31.206 A:middle
almost out.

00:27:33.056 --> 00:27:34.926 A:middle
Perfect, we did it.

00:27:36.416 --> 00:27:37.246 A:middle
Yeah. What?

00:27:38.516 --> 00:27:41.936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:42.436 --> 00:27:44.316 A:middle
And we've even unlocked a new

00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:45.276 A:middle
item for our collection.

00:27:46.486 --> 00:27:47.646 A:middle
But the fun doesn't need to end

00:27:47.646 --> 00:27:50.226 A:middle
there because with ARKit 2, we

00:27:50.226 --> 00:27:53.166 A:middle
get to save our entire world

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:56.136 A:middle
back into our physical set and

00:27:56.136 --> 00:27:57.326 A:middle
pick up where we left off.

00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:00.856 A:middle
[applause] All right.
