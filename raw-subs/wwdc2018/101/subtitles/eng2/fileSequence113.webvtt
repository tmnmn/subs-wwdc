these like buttons and share

01:53:00.486 --> 01:53:02.586 A:middle
buttons and these comment

01:53:02.716 --> 01:53:03.246 A:middle
fields.

01:53:03.896 --> 01:53:05.876 A:middle
Well, it turns out these can be

01:53:05.876 --> 01:53:07.816 A:middle
used to track you, whether you

01:53:07.816 --> 01:53:10.516 A:middle
click on them or not, and so

01:53:10.516 --> 01:53:12.416 A:middle
this year we are shutting that

01:53:12.496 --> 01:53:12.976 A:middle
down.

01:53:14.516 --> 01:53:21.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:53:22.056 --> 01:53:23.026 A:middle
Now if you do want to interact

01:53:23.026 --> 01:53:23.966 A:middle
with one of these or one of

01:53:23.966 --> 01:53:25.526 A:middle
these apps tries to access that

01:53:25.526 --> 01:53:28.186 A:middle
information, you'll get this,

01:53:28.186 --> 01:53:30.416 A:middle
and you can decide to keep your

01:53:30.416 --> 01:53:31.426 A:middle
information private.

01:53:32.386 --> 01:53:37.116 A:middle
Now next let's talk about

01:53:37.216 --> 01:53:37.896 A:middle
Fingerprinting.

01:53:38.486 --> 01:53:40.776 A:middle
You know, data companies are

01:53:40.776 --> 01:53:43.106 A:middle
clever and relentless, and in

01:53:43.106 --> 01:53:45.936 A:middle
addition to cookies, they use

01:53:45.936 --> 01:53:47.016 A:middle
another method called

01:53:47.016 --> 01:53:47.876 A:middle
Fingerprinting.

01:53:48.246 --> 01:53:49.336 A:middle
And here's how it works.

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:51.346 A:middle
Just like you can be identified

01:53:51.346 --> 01:53:53.516 A:middle
by a fingerprint, it turns out

01:53:53.516 --> 01:53:55.456 A:middle
that when you browse the web,

01:53:55.816 --> 01:53:57.476 A:middle
you're device can be identify by

01:53:57.476 --> 01:53:59.516 A:middle
