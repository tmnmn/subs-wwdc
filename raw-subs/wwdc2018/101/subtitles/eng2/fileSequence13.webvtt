00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:00.376 A:middle
And while it's still early days,

00:13:00.376 --> 00:13:01.996 A:middle
we're really pleased with some

00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:03.146 A:middle
of the results we're seeing.

00:13:03.336 --> 00:13:04.306 A:middle
And so I'd like to share some

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:04.616 A:middle
with you.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.486 A:middle
And I'm going to use an example

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:07.966 A:middle
of a popular phone from a few

00:13:07.966 --> 00:13:08.556 A:middle
years ago.

00:13:08.646 --> 00:13:10.466 A:middle
This is the iPhone 6Plus.

00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:13.086 A:middle
Now on that device, iOS 12

00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:13.966 A:middle
delivers a number of

00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:15.096 A:middle
improvements across common

00:13:15.096 --> 00:13:15.826 A:middle
operations.

00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:17.846 A:middle
You'll see that apps launch up

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.306 A:middle
to 40 percent faster.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.136 A:middle
The keyboard can come up up to

00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:22.966 A:middle
50 percent faster, and you can

00:13:22.966 --> 00:13:25.206 A:middle
slide to take a photo at up to

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:26.726 A:middle
70 percent faster.

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:32.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:35.176 A:middle
Now our deepest focus this year

00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:37.306 A:middle
is optimizing the system when

00:13:37.306 --> 00:13:38.576 A:middle
it's under load, and that's

00:13:38.576 --> 00:13:39.546 A:middle
where you need performance the

00:13:39.546 --> 00:13:41.856 A:middle
most and where iOS 12 really

00:13:41.856 --> 00:13:42.436 A:middle
shines.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.826 A:middle
Now, we've put iOS 12 through

00:13:44.826 --> 00:13:46.936 A:middle
our stress test, and we saw in

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:48.836 A:middle
those conditions Share Sheet

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:51.086 A:middle
coming up twice as fast and apps

00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:53.436 A:middle
launching twice as fast.

00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:55.526 A:middle
These are big, big improvements.

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.496 A:middle
Now this took changes-- thank

00:13:57.496 --> 00:13:57.986 A:middle
you very much.

00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:00.696 A:middle
This took improvements in many,
