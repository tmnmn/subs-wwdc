02:11:58.136 --> 02:12:00.676 A:middle
he could, and I'm like just buy

02:12:00.676 --> 02:12:00.976 A:middle
the burger.

02:12:01.066 --> 02:12:02.306 A:middle
And he's like no, that's three

02:12:02.306 --> 02:12:03.436 A:middle
bucks that I could put towards

02:12:03.436 --> 02:12:03.746 A:middle
the app.

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:06.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Jeremy went out to build the

02:12:06.136 --> 02:12:07.426 A:middle
first version of Yelp, and it

02:12:07.426 --> 02:12:08.696 A:middle
was a total bust, a total

02:12:08.696 --> 02:12:08.976 A:middle
failure.

02:12:09.046 --> 02:12:11.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; She tried really hard on a

02:12:11.726 --> 02:12:13.646 A:middle
couple different titles, and

02:12:13.646 --> 02:12:14.816 A:middle
you've never heard of them.

02:12:14.816 --> 02:12:16.556 A:middle
And, you know, that's a really

02:12:16.556 --> 02:12:16.976 A:middle
rough feeling.

02:12:17.126 --> 02:12:18.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was definitely a low

02:12:18.966 --> 02:12:20.576 A:middle
point for Jeremy because it was

02:12:20.576 --> 02:12:22.756 A:middle
like, hey we got to retool and

02:12:22.756 --> 02:12:22.976 A:middle
try again.

02:12:23.176 --> 02:12:25.146 A:middle
What Jeremy did notice in the

02:12:25.146 --> 02:12:26.556 A:middle
data was that people loved

02:12:26.556 --> 02:12:28.396 A:middle
writing comments, and that was

02:12:28.396 --> 02:12:30.066 A:middle
really the genesis of the second

02:12:30.066 --> 02:12:31.646 A:middle
version of Yelp, which worked.

02:12:32.086 --> 02:12:33.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You have to be really okay

02:12:33.666 --> 02:12:35.186 A:middle
with waking up to failure and

02:12:35.186 --> 02:12:36.836 A:middle
then at the end of a whole bunch

02:12:36.836 --> 02:12:37.856 A:middle
of failures is something that's

02:12:37.856 --> 02:12:37.976 A:middle
great.

02:12:40.046 --> 02:12:41.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tessa didn't really think I

02:12:41.726 --> 02:12:42.976 A:middle
want to make an app.

02:12:43.146 --> 02:12:44.836 A:middle
Tessa found a problem, a food

02:12:44.836 --> 02:12:46.386 A:middle
waste which you could use the

02:12:46.386 --> 02:12:47.976 A:middle
app to help to solve.

02:12:48.046 --> 02:12:49.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Emma's grandma was diagnosed

02:12:49.916 --> 02:12:50.856 A:middle
with Alzheimer's.

02:12:51.076 --> 02:12:52.406 A:middle
She even forgot my daughter's

02:12:52.406 --> 02:12:52.836 A:middle
birthday.

02:12:53.536 --> 02:12:55.286 A:middle
So Emma tried to search for an

02:12:55.286 --> 02:12:55.916 A:middle
app that would help,

02:12:56.046 --> 02:12:56.976 A:middle
but she couldn't find it.

02:12:57.066 --> 02:13:00.136 A:middle
So she said, you know, why don't
