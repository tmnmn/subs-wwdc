01:36:58.936 --> 01:37:00.706 A:middle
capabilities and continuity.

01:37:01.266 --> 01:37:03.466 A:middle
And last year with High Sierra,

01:37:03.666 --> 01:37:05.566 A:middle
we focused on deep technology,

01:37:05.676 --> 01:37:07.326 A:middle
preparing the Mac for future

01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:07.886 A:middle
innovation.

01:37:08.596 --> 01:37:10.146 A:middle
Well this year, we made some

01:37:10.146 --> 01:37:13.246 A:middle
striking changes to macOS, and

01:37:13.246 --> 01:37:15.446 A:middle
we've left the high country for

01:37:15.446 --> 01:37:17.306 A:middle
a place entirely different but

01:37:17.306 --> 01:37:20.046 A:middle
not less beautiful and here

01:37:20.046 --> 01:37:22.046 A:middle
still in California, and I'd

01:37:22.046 --> 01:37:23.286 A:middle
like to take you there now.

01:37:24.156 --> 01:37:30.176 A:middle
Our next release of macOS is

01:37:30.176 --> 01:37:32.006 A:middle
macOS Mojave.

01:37:33.516 --> 01:37:39.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:37:40.056 --> 01:37:41.946 A:middle
Now, Mojave is beautiful during

01:37:41.946 --> 01:37:43.366 A:middle
the day, but what really

01:37:43.366 --> 01:37:45.486 A:middle
captured our imagination was the

01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:47.886 A:middle
beauty of the desert at night.

01:37:48.936 --> 01:37:52.566 A:middle
And this inspired one of our

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:55.156 A:middle
most distinctive new features,

01:37:55.826 --> 01:37:59.726 A:middle
and I'd like to show it to you
