00:48:53.516 --> 00:49:01.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:03.106 A:middle
And once you've reached your

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.246 A:middle
limit, instead of the app,

00:49:04.826 --> 00:49:06.146 A:middle
you'll see this.

00:49:06.146 --> 00:49:07.146 A:middle
It's time to move on.

00:49:07.706 --> 00:49:08.596 A:middle
Now, we'll let you grant

00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:09.746 A:middle
yourself and extension if you

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:11.396 A:middle
want, but we'll give you a

00:49:11.396 --> 00:49:12.796 A:middle
reminder later to move along.

00:49:13.056 --> 00:49:15.586 A:middle
Now, this is also in sync across

00:49:15.676 --> 00:49:16.996 A:middle
your iPhone and iPad, so your

00:49:16.996 --> 00:49:18.796 A:middle
limits apply to your total

00:49:18.796 --> 00:49:19.386 A:middle
usage.

00:49:19.686 --> 00:49:20.536 A:middle
And we think this is going to be

00:49:20.536 --> 00:49:23.626 A:middle
helpful for many people, but

00:49:23.686 --> 00:49:25.556 A:middle
especially for some kids.

00:49:26.246 --> 00:49:28.006 A:middle
And we know this is something

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.266 A:middle
that can help families achieve

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.986 A:middle
the right balance for them.

00:49:31.266 --> 00:49:32.476 A:middle
And of course it starts with

00:49:32.476 --> 00:49:33.856 A:middle
providing your kids with great

00:49:33.856 --> 00:49:34.956 A:middle
information so they get an

00:49:34.956 --> 00:49:36.496 A:middle
activity report of their own,

00:49:36.496 --> 00:49:39.366 A:middle
but as a parent, you get one as

00:49:39.366 --> 00:49:43.076 A:middle
well on your device, and based

00:49:43.076 --> 00:49:44.606 A:middle
on what you see, you have the

00:49:44.606 --> 00:49:47.216 A:middle
option of creating allowances.

00:49:48.516 --> 00:49:54.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:49:55.056 --> 00:49:56.596 A:middle
Now you have many options.

00:49:56.686 --> 00:49:58.416 A:middle
One of them is downtime, time

00:49:58.416 --> 00:49:59.406 A:middle
when you want your kids to

00:49:59.446 --> 00:50:00.926 A:middle
unplug altogether.
