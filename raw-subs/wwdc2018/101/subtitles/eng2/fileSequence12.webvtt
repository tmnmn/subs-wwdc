Now, delivering all of these

00:12:09.446 --> 00:12:10.976 A:middle
features across such a wide

00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:12.506 A:middle
range of devices will

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.386 A:middle
maintaining high performance is

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:15.976 A:middle
a challenge we take really

00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:19.506 A:middle
seriously, and so for iOS 12, we

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.546 A:middle

00:12:30.446 --> 00:12:32.396 A:middle
making improvements, to make

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.906 A:middle
your device faster and more

00:12:33.906 --> 00:12:35.936 A:middle
responsive, and because we want

00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:37.386 A:middle
these changes to be available to

00:12:37.386 --> 00:12:39.326 A:middle
the full range of our customers,

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:41.996 A:middle
iOS 12 will be available on all

00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:43.976 A:middle
the same devices as iOS 11.

supported by an Apple release,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.526 A:middle
and we're focusing our efforts

00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:57.036 A:middle
especially on the oldest

00:12:57.036 --> 00:12:57.736 A:middle
