00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:00.366 A:middle
things like messaging, ride

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:02.116 A:middle
sharing, and payments.

00:32:02.626 --> 00:32:03.966 A:middle
But we wanted to make Siri able

00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:05.956 A:middle
to do much more for you, and

00:32:05.956 --> 00:32:07.516 A:middle
we're doing that by taking

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:09.226 A:middle
advantage of the power of apps

00:32:09.356 --> 00:32:11.106 A:middle
with a new feature we call

00:32:11.106 --> 00:32:11.986 A:middle
Shortcuts.

00:32:12.536 --> 00:32:14.586 A:middle
Now with shortcuts any app can

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:17.016 A:middle
expose quick actions to Siri.

00:32:17.276 --> 00:32:18.736 A:middle
Let's look at some examples.

00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:20.746 A:middle
Now say you have the Tile app

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:22.116 A:middle
because you're always losing

00:32:22.116 --> 00:32:22.856 A:middle
your keys.

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.016 A:middle
Well, the Tile app can expose

00:32:25.266 --> 00:32:27.446 A:middle
the option to add a shortcut to

00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:28.156 A:middle
Siri.

00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:30.126 A:middle
And you can assign your own

00:32:30.236 --> 00:32:32.136 A:middle
phrase, such as I lost my keys

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:33.596 A:middle
would be a good choice, and when

00:32:33.596 --> 00:32:36.026 A:middle
you then say it, Siri will

00:32:36.026 --> 00:32:38.846 A:middle
automatically activate Tile and

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:40.266 A:middle
show you right in the Siri UI

00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:42.086 A:middle
start ringing your Tile just

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:42.656 A:middle
like that.

00:32:42.716 --> 00:32:43.676 A:middle
It's really great.

00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:44.016 A:middle
[applause]

00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:47.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:48.126 --> 00:32:49.676 A:middle
Of course there's so many uses

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:50.606 A:middle
for this kind of thing.

00:32:50.606 --> 00:32:52.286 A:middle
You could say game time to get

00:32:52.286 --> 00:32:53.546 A:middle
your team's schedule from

00:32:53.836 --> 00:32:56.176 A:middle
TeamSnap or help me relax to

00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:58.496 A:middle
kick off a meditation or order

00:32:58.496 --> 00:33:00.766 A:middle
my groceries to order your
