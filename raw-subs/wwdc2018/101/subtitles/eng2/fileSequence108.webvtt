01:47:59.716 --> 01:48:03.806 A:middle
So I can take one like this, and

01:48:03.806 --> 01:48:06.726 A:middle
when I do, I can select use

01:48:06.796 --> 01:48:08.736 A:middle
photo, and it apps directly in

01:48:08.736 --> 01:48:09.446 A:middle
my document.

01:48:09.446 --> 01:48:09.966 A:middle
Isn't that cool?

01:48:10.516 --> 01:48:14.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:48:15.236 --> 01:48:16.296 A:middle
Now, this works as well for

01:48:16.296 --> 01:48:17.516 A:middle
scanning documents.

01:48:18.166 --> 01:48:19.496 A:middle
So here I have a place where I

01:48:19.496 --> 01:48:20.656 A:middle
could use a scan.

01:48:21.376 --> 01:48:23.236 A:middle
Once again, I'm going to select

01:48:24.016 --> 01:48:25.956 A:middle
from the menu and this time scan

01:48:25.956 --> 01:48:26.466 A:middle
document.

01:48:26.746 --> 01:48:28.676 A:middle
Again, my camera lights up, this

01:48:28.676 --> 01:48:29.886 A:middle
time right in my document

01:48:29.926 --> 01:48:30.326 A:middle
scanner.

01:48:31.036 --> 01:48:32.246 A:middle
I just scan like this.

01:48:32.246 --> 01:48:34.546 A:middle
I can save it.

01:48:35.616 --> 01:48:37.596 A:middle
And my scan goes immediately,

01:48:37.596 --> 01:48:39.956 A:middle
and I think I forgot to push the

01:48:39.956 --> 01:48:40.516 A:middle
save button.

01:48:40.516 --> 01:48:41.556 A:middle
Sorry about that everybody.

01:48:42.046 --> 01:48:42.846 A:middle
There you go, appears

01:48:42.846 --> 01:48:44.176 A:middle
immediately in my document.

01:48:44.856 --> 01:48:45.326 A:middle
Thank you.

01:48:48.616 --> 01:48:49.886 A:middle
[applause] And so just like that

01:48:50.526 --> 01:48:53.496 A:middle
I can take photos, stills, and

01:48:53.586 --> 01:48:55.976 A:middle
even capture video, and this is

01:48:55.976 --> 01:48:57.486 A:middle
a quick look at some great new

01:48:57.486 --> 01:48:58.936 A:middle
features in Mojave.
