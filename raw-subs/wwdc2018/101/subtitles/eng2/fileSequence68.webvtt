01:07:59.866 --> 01:08:00.496 A:middle
Now when you're doing

01:08:06.156 --> 01:08:06.556 A:middle
[applause]-- now when you do

01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:07.696 A:middle
want to go do a workout, there's

01:08:07.696 --> 01:08:08.886 A:middle
a lot of workout types you can

01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:10.606 A:middle
choose from, and they all have

01:08:10.656 --> 01:08:11.876 A:middle
custom algorithms to measure

01:08:11.876 --> 01:08:13.466 A:middle
things like calorie burn, pace,

01:08:13.466 --> 01:08:15.216 A:middle
distance, elevation gain, and

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.076 A:middle
when you're swimming, it even

01:08:16.076 --> 01:08:17.416 A:middle
counts laps and detects which

01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:18.526 A:middle
swim strokes you're using.

01:08:18.756 --> 01:08:20.376 A:middle
And with Gym Kit, your metrics

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:21.756 A:middle
are in sync with your favorite

01:08:21.756 --> 01:08:22.395 A:middle
gym equipment.

01:08:22.626 --> 01:08:23.546 A:middle
And we're really excited to

01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:24.486 A:middle
bring more enhancements to

01:08:24.486 --> 01:08:27.046 A:middle
workouts in watchOS 5, starting

01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:28.296 A:middle
with a new workout type for

01:08:28.296 --> 01:08:28.926 A:middle
yoga.

01:08:29.116 --> 01:08:30.336 A:middle
Now this works primarily from

01:08:30.336 --> 01:08:32.725 A:middle
your heart rate, and we

01:08:32.725 --> 01:08:34.256 A:middle
calibrate this to your fitness

01:08:34.256 --> 01:08:35.595 A:middle
through the rest of your day, so

01:08:35.595 --> 01:08:36.526 A:middle
now you can more accurately

01:08:36.526 --> 01:08:38.095 A:middle
track those yoga sessions

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.616 A:middle
including those intense Vinyasa

01:08:39.656 --> 01:08:40.026 A:middle
sessions.

01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:42.685 A:middle
New we've also added a new

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.166 A:middle
workout type for hiking.

01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:45.986 A:middle
This takes into account pace and

01:08:45.986 --> 01:08:47.676 A:middle
heart rate and elevation gain so

01:08:47.776 --> 01:08:48.805 A:middle
you can more accurately get

01:08:48.805 --> 01:08:50.055 A:middle
exercise credit while you're

01:08:50.055 --> 01:08:51.756 A:middle
hiking on steep terrain or

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:52.626 A:middle
really long stages.

01:08:53.336 --> 01:08:56.725 A:middle
And Apple watch has become a

01:08:56.725 --> 01:08:58.536 A:middle
really great running companion

01:08:58.536 --> 01:08:59.816 A:middle
especially now that we've added

01:08:59.816 --> 01:09:01.746 A:middle
GPS and cellular and music
