00:50:59.376 --> 00:51:01.196 A:middle
of our devices, and that's

00:51:01.446 --> 00:51:02.356 A:middle
communication.

00:51:02.356 --> 00:51:04.716 A:middle
And we'll start with messages.

00:51:05.566 --> 00:51:07.516 A:middle
Messages has given us fun ways

00:51:07.516 --> 00:51:09.366 A:middle
to express ourselves with emoji

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:12.116 A:middle
and now Animoji, and one of the

00:51:12.116 --> 00:51:14.116 A:middle
things that make Animoji so fun

00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:15.706 A:middle
is how expressive they are, you

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:17.666 A:middle
know, from smiles to frowns, to

00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:19.236 A:middle
nods of the head and blinking of

00:51:19.236 --> 00:51:19.726 A:middle
the eye.

00:51:20.326 --> 00:51:22.626 A:middle
Animoji does such an amazing job

00:51:22.626 --> 00:51:23.896 A:middle
tracking our expressions.

00:51:23.896 --> 00:51:25.586 A:middle
And this year, we're taking

00:51:25.586 --> 00:51:27.456 A:middle
Animoji to a whole new level,

00:51:27.456 --> 00:51:29.606 A:middle
the breakthrough new technology

00:51:29.676 --> 00:51:32.326 A:middle
we call Tongue Detection.

00:51:35.606 --> 00:51:36.096 A:middle
[applause] That's right.

00:51:36.796 --> 00:51:38.426 A:middle
Now, you can make your favorite

00:51:38.426 --> 00:51:40.546 A:middle
Animoji do this.

00:51:41.856 --> 00:51:43.126 A:middle
We're all going to be sticking

00:51:43.126 --> 00:51:44.606 A:middle
out our tongues to our phones in

00:51:44.606 --> 00:51:45.276 A:middle
the near future.

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.116 A:middle
Now, we've also, we're also

00:51:48.116 --> 00:51:49.486 A:middle
introducing some great new

00:51:49.486 --> 00:51:50.906 A:middle
Animoji that I think you're all

00:51:50.906 --> 00:51:52.726 A:middle
going to love, like ghost,

00:51:54.136 --> 00:51:59.906 A:middle
koala, tiger, and T-Rex.
