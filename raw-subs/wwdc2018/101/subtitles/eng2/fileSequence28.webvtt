[applause] All right.

00:28:01.116 --> 00:28:01.706 A:middle
That's awesome.

00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:03.896 A:middle
So much fun.

00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:05.286 A:middle
But what makes this truly

00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:06.856 A:middle
amazing is how with just a

00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:09.166 A:middle
single Lego creation and ARKit 2

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.546 A:middle
it really opens up those

00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:12.046 A:middle
creative play possibilities.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:14.466 A:middle
So look out for more Lego AR

00:28:14.466 --> 00:28:16.016 A:middle
experiences in the App Store

00:28:16.436 --> 00:28:17.176 A:middle
later this year.

00:28:17.216 --> 00:28:17.976 A:middle
Thank you very much everybody.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:21.706 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:23.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Isn't that great?

00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.916 A:middle
So that's our update on AR and

00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:26.586 A:middle
iOS 12.

00:28:27.136 --> 00:28:28.726 A:middle
Next, I'd like to turn to

00:28:28.866 --> 00:28:29.466 A:middle
Photos.

00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:32.556 A:middle
You know, over a trillion photos

00:28:32.596 --> 00:28:34.656 A:middle
are captured on iPhone each

00:28:34.656 --> 00:28:38.516 A:middle
year, and Photos is the best way

00:28:38.586 --> 00:28:41.096 A:middle
to relive and share those

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:41.706 A:middle
moments.

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:43.996 A:middle
This year we're making photos

00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:45.916 A:middle
even better, and it starts with

00:28:45.916 --> 00:28:46.566 A:middle
Search.

00:28:47.066 --> 00:28:49.126 A:middle
Search has powerful object and

00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:50.166 A:middle
scene recognition.

00:28:50.616 --> 00:28:51.766 A:middle
It lets you search for photos

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:53.106 A:middle
based on things like searching

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:55.716 A:middle
for cars or dogs or flowers, and

00:28:55.716 --> 00:28:56.836 A:middle
that's a great way to explore

00:28:56.836 --> 00:28:59.256 A:middle
your library, but in iOS 12,

00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:01.456 A:middle
Search now starts working for
