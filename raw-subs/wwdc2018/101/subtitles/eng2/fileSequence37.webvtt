00:36:59.766 --> 00:37:00.226 A:middle
[applause] It's pretty cool.

00:37:01.516 --> 00:37:06.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:07.046 --> 00:37:08.146 A:middle
So I would love to be on that

00:37:08.146 --> 00:37:09.466 A:middle
vacation, but I should, I don't

00:37:09.466 --> 00:37:10.966 A:middle
know, probably finish this demo,

00:37:11.076 --> 00:37:13.076 A:middle
so let's head back to work, and

00:37:13.076 --> 00:37:14.296 A:middle
I can show you how the Shortcut

00:37:14.296 --> 00:37:15.716 A:middle
app can help me with my commute

00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:16.556 A:middle
home.

00:37:18.126 --> 00:37:19.866 A:middle
We start in the Gallery where

00:37:19.866 --> 00:37:21.106 A:middle
there's hundreds of premade

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:22.566 A:middle
shortcuts that you can download,

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:23.946 A:middle
or we can hop over to the

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:25.466 A:middle
library, and I've got a bunch of

00:37:25.466 --> 00:37:26.536 A:middle
shortcuts here, but I want to

00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:27.756 A:middle
show you my heading home

00:37:27.756 --> 00:37:28.136 A:middle
shortcut.

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:31.246 A:middle
You can see that it's just

00:37:31.246 --> 00:37:32.226 A:middle
really a series of steps.

00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:34.556 A:middle
It grabs my location and travel

00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:36.586 A:middle
time, and it sends my ETA to my

00:37:36.586 --> 00:37:37.236 A:middle
roommate.

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:39.446 A:middle
It sets my HomeKit thermostat to

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:41.026 A:middle
70 degrees, and it turns on my

00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:41.466 A:middle
fan.

00:37:41.996 --> 00:37:43.336 A:middle
And last, it gets directions

00:37:43.336 --> 00:37:44.626 A:middle
home with Apple maps with the

00:37:44.626 --> 00:37:45.916 A:middle
best route to avoid traffic.

00:37:46.376 --> 00:37:48.386 A:middle
Now this is already pretty cool,

00:37:48.656 --> 00:37:50.656 A:middle
but I happen to be an NPR News

00:37:50.826 --> 00:37:52.426 A:middle
junkie, so I should probably

00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:53.696 A:middle
just add that to my shortcut to

00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:55.046 A:middle
save me some trouble on the ride

00:37:55.046 --> 00:37:55.286 A:middle
home.

00:37:55.626 --> 00:37:58.146 A:middle
Let's tap search, and there's a

00:37:58.146 --> 00:37:59.686 A:middle
bunch I can add here, but I can

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:02.126 A:middle
just tap Siri suggestions, and
