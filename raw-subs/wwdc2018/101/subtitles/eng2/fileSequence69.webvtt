streaming.

01:09:02.366 --> 01:09:03.496 A:middle
And we're making this an even

01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:04.886 A:middle
better experience now for

01:09:04.886 --> 01:09:06.166 A:middle
training runs and races.

01:09:06.706 --> 01:09:07.666 A:middle
In addition to current and

01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:09.066 A:middle
average pace, you now have the

01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:10.456 A:middle
option to keep track of your

01:09:10.456 --> 01:09:12.126 A:middle
rolling mile pace, which is how

01:09:12.126 --> 01:09:13.435 A:middle
fast you ran the immediately

01:09:13.435 --> 01:09:14.265 A:middle
preceding mile.

01:09:14.986 --> 01:09:16.176 A:middle
You can also now set a custom

01:09:16.176 --> 01:09:17.876 A:middle
pace alert, so your Apple watch

01:09:17.876 --> 01:09:18.816 A:middle
will tap you when you're above

01:09:18.816 --> 01:09:19.716 A:middle
or below the pace that you've

01:09:19.716 --> 01:09:20.026 A:middle
set.

01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.236 A:middle
And finally, runners will now

01:09:22.236 --> 01:09:23.746 A:middle
get cadence so you can see your

01:09:23.746 --> 01:09:24.836 A:middle
current steps per minute.

01:09:24.836 --> 01:09:26.366 A:middle
We're really excited for runners

01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:27.506 A:middle
to try these out.

01:09:28.676 --> 01:09:28.906 A:middle
Now--

[ Applause ]

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:35.526 A:middle
Now there are sometimes when you

01:09:35.526 --> 01:09:36.576 A:middle
forget to start a workout on

01:09:36.576 --> 01:09:37.446 A:middle
watch, but you've started

01:09:37.446 --> 01:09:39.176 A:middle
working out, and to solve this

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:40.816 A:middle
now, we're adding automatic

01:09:40.816 --> 01:09:41.765 A:middle
workout detection.

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:47.555 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:48.975 A:middle
So your Apple Watch will now

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:50.106 A:middle
offer to start tracking your

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:51.256 A:middle
workout if it senses that you're

01:09:51.256 --> 01:09:51.856 A:middle
beginning one.

01:09:52.036 --> 01:09:53.326 A:middle
And even if you press start

01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:54.866 A:middle
sometime after you began working

01:09:54.866 --> 01:09:56.546 A:middle
out, you'll get retroactive

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:57.706 A:middle
credit for the workouts that you

01:09:57.706 --> 01:09:58.026 A:middle
did.
