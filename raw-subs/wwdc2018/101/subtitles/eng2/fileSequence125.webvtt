[ Applause ]

02:05:00.866 --> 02:05:02.526 A:middle
We love the Mac because it's,

02:05:02.706 --> 02:05:04.206 A:middle
and we love macOS because it's

02:05:04.326 --> 02:05:08.006 A:middle
explicitly created that a unique

02:05:08.006 --> 02:05:10.196 A:middle
characteristics of Mac hardware,

02:05:10.196 --> 02:05:11.616 A:middle
like the ergonomics of the

02:05:11.696 --> 02:05:13.536 A:middle
keyboard and the trackpad, the

02:05:13.536 --> 02:05:15.486 A:middle
flexibility in displays and

02:05:15.486 --> 02:05:17.416 A:middle
storage and because of the power

02:05:17.416 --> 02:05:18.076 A:middle
it exposes.

02:05:18.076 --> 02:05:19.036 A:middle
It makes the Mac able to

02:05:19.036 --> 02:05:20.686 A:middle
accomplish almost anything.

02:05:21.256 --> 02:05:22.926 A:middle
So we think that this question

02:05:22.926 --> 02:05:24.126 A:middle
is actually coming from

02:05:24.186 --> 02:05:24.986 A:middle
something else.

02:05:26.056 --> 02:05:28.126 A:middle
You know, Mac users have access

02:05:28.126 --> 02:05:31.026 A:middle
to a rich set of great native

02:05:31.026 --> 02:05:32.576 A:middle
applications, apps that take

02:05:33.006 --> 02:05:35.076 A:middle
full advantage of the power of

02:05:35.076 --> 02:05:36.176 A:middle
Mac technologies.

02:05:36.786 --> 02:05:38.976 A:middle
But Mac users also use apps

02:05:39.006 --> 02:05:40.356 A:middle
based on other technologies.

02:05:40.896 --> 02:05:42.766 A:middle
We routinely access web-based

02:05:42.766 --> 02:05:44.626 A:middle
experiences like Netflix that

02:05:44.626 --> 02:05:46.636 A:middle
build on WebKit, the

02:05:46.636 --> 02:05:48.416 A:middle
standards-based web technology

02:05:48.416 --> 02:05:50.396 A:middle
in Safari, and we also run

02:05:50.666 --> 02:05:52.776 A:middle
sometimes cross-platform games

02:05:53.166 --> 02:05:55.786 A:middle
built on technology like metal.

02:05:55.786 --> 02:05:58.616 A:middle
And all of these platforms

02:05:58.816 --> 02:06:00.136 A:middle
enrich the Mac user's
