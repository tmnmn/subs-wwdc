Anders.

00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:03.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. I will add a bank over

00:26:03.176 --> 00:26:03.356 A:middle
here.

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:05.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Very nice, I like it.

00:26:05.956 --> 00:26:08.716 A:middle
How about taking this for a

00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:13.256 A:middle
spin.

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:15.176 A:middle
Let's just look at all those

00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:16.606 A:middle
rich details you can see on the

00:26:16.606 --> 00:26:20.566 A:middle
outside of the building and even

00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:23.536 A:middle
on the inside.

00:26:23.536 --> 00:26:25.376 A:middle
Yeah, I think I'm going to add

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:25.856 A:middle
this guy.

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:27.256 A:middle
He's definitely going to keep

00:26:27.256 --> 00:26:27.956 A:middle
the bank safe.

00:26:30.316 --> 00:26:32.476 A:middle
Oh look, my character's hungry.

00:26:33.056 --> 00:26:33.926 A:middle
Let's take him over to the

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:34.426 A:middle
bakery.

00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:36.116 A:middle
Well let's see what they have.

00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:39.086 A:middle
Because now with ARKit 2, we get

00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:40.746 A:middle
to see inside our physical

00:26:40.996 --> 00:26:43.026 A:middle
creations and check out all the

00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:44.206 A:middle
details that were hidden before.

00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:46.596 A:middle
We've got a ballerina, a little

00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:49.336 A:middle
music session going on, and

00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:50.636 A:middle
let's make a bathroom-- oops

00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:51.086 A:middle
sorry.

00:26:51.186 --> 00:26:52.616 A:middle
Moving on.

00:26:52.616 --> 00:26:54.126 A:middle
Oh, another play trigger in the

00:26:54.126 --> 00:26:54.576 A:middle
bakery.

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:56.146 A:middle
Let's see what happens when I

00:26:56.186 --> 00:26:56.726 A:middle
click on this.

00:26:56.726 --> 00:26:57.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Um, fresh [inaudible].

00:26:57.656 --> 00:27:00.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, that doesn't look too
