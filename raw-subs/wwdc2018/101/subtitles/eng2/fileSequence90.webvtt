ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

01:30:00.626 --> 01:30:02.836 A:middle
more, but it used to be really

01:30:02.836 --> 01:30:04.896 A:middle
painful to set up, having to

01:30:04.896 --> 01:30:06.156 A:middle
authenticate each app

01:30:06.376 --> 01:30:07.146 A:middle

I'm sure all of you have seen

01:30:08.516 --> 01:30:09.926 A:middle
that six-digit code you have to

01:30:20.256 --> 01:30:21.566 A:middle
the apps your subscription

01:30:21.566 --> 01:30:22.186 A:middle
supports.

Charter Spectrum [applause]--

01:30:47.616 --> 01:30:51.586 A:middle

01:30:51.586 --> 01:30:52.816 A:middle
Charter Spectrum will be the

01:30:52.926 --> 01:30:54.236 A:middle
first to support zero sign-on
