00:24:54.516 --> 00:25:01.596 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:25:02.096 --> 00:25:03.676 A:middle
And just look at all of those

00:25:03.676 --> 00:25:05.226 A:middle
rich details we can now bring

00:25:05.226 --> 00:25:08.086 A:middle
into our sets, because when we

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:09.886 A:middle
combine physical and digital

00:25:09.886 --> 00:25:12.226 A:middle
together like this, it really

00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:13.616 A:middle
opens up those creative play

00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:14.326 A:middle
possibilities.

00:25:14.426 --> 00:25:16.976 A:middle
And there's so much to do here.

00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:19.606 A:middle
Did you see these icons of the

00:25:19.606 --> 00:25:20.746 A:middle
people and objects?

00:25:21.626 --> 00:25:22.896 A:middle
Well they represent missions and

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.196 A:middle
stories that we can explore.

00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:27.386 A:middle
And with a world as rich and as

00:25:27.386 --> 00:25:28.866 A:middle
immersive as this, who wouldn't

00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:29.446 A:middle
want to play?

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:30.926 A:middle
So let's add a character.

00:25:31.226 --> 00:25:33.216 A:middle
How about this little guy here?

00:25:33.216 --> 00:25:36.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome back, let's go on an

00:25:36.046 --> 00:25:36.316 A:middle
adventure.

00:25:36.316 --> 00:25:36.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:37.696 A:middle
Let's go on an adventure.

00:25:37.696 --> 00:25:39.846 A:middle
But going on an adventure with

00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:42.456 A:middle
friends is often way more fun.

00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:44.216 A:middle
Anders, why don't you pop in

00:25:44.216 --> 00:25:44.506 A:middle
here.

00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:45.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm always up for an

00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:48.106 A:middle
adventure.

00:25:48.386 --> 00:25:48.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:51.606 A:middle
Because now with ARKit 2's

00:25:51.706 --> 00:25:53.706 A:middle
multiuser support, we get to

00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:56.086 A:middle
play with up to four friends in

00:25:56.156 --> 00:25:58.016 A:middle
the same space.

00:25:58.016 --> 00:25:58.916 A:middle
Let's go ahead and add a few

00:25:58.976 --> 00:25:59.816 A:middle
things from our collection,

00:25:59.816 --> 00:26:00.126 A:middle
Anders.
