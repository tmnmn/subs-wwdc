00:32:58.496 --> 00:33:00.766 A:middle
my groceries to order your

00:33:00.766 --> 00:33:01.326 A:middle
usual.

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:03.876 A:middle
You know, with millions of apps,

00:33:03.906 --> 00:33:05.546 A:middle
Shortcut enables incredible

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:07.096 A:middle
possibilities for how you use

00:33:07.096 --> 00:33:07.656 A:middle
Siri.

00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:10.756 A:middle
Now, as you know, Siri is more

00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:11.526 A:middle
than just a voice.

00:33:11.526 --> 00:33:12.936 A:middle
Siri is working all the time in

00:33:12.936 --> 00:33:14.286 A:middle
the background to make proactive

00:33:14.376 --> 00:33:16.276 A:middle
suggestions for you even before

00:33:16.276 --> 00:33:19.776 A:middle
you ask, and now with Shortcut,

00:33:20.196 --> 00:33:21.656 A:middle
Siri can do so much more.

00:33:22.036 --> 00:33:23.406 A:middle
So, for instance, let's say you

00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:24.926 A:middle
order a coffee every morning at

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.676 A:middle
Phil's before you go to work.

00:33:27.126 --> 00:33:28.856 A:middle
Well now, Siri can suggest right

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:30.336 A:middle
on your lock screen that you do

00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:30.596 A:middle
that.

00:33:30.596 --> 00:33:32.666 A:middle
You tap on it, and you can place

00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:34.746 A:middle
the order right from there.

00:33:35.196 --> 00:33:36.546 A:middle
Or if when you get to the gym

00:33:36.746 --> 00:33:38.056 A:middle
you use Active to track

00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.146 A:middle
workouts, well that suggestion

00:33:40.146 --> 00:33:41.686 A:middle
will appear right on your lock

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.066 A:middle
screen.

00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:43.436 A:middle
And this even works when you

00:33:43.436 --> 00:33:44.596 A:middle
pull down into Search.

00:33:44.886 --> 00:33:46.316 A:middle
You'll get great suggestions.

00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:47.876 A:middle
Like say you're running late for

00:33:47.876 --> 00:33:49.306 A:middle
a meeting, well Siri will

00:33:49.356 --> 00:33:50.956 A:middle
suggest you text the meeting

00:33:50.956 --> 00:33:51.536 A:middle
organizer.

00:33:51.536 --> 00:33:54.026 A:middle
Or when you go to the movie,

00:33:54.026 --> 00:33:55.616 A:middle
suggest that you turn on Do Not

00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:56.436 A:middle
Disturb.

00:33:56.436 --> 00:33:57.586 A:middle
That's just being considerate.

00:33:58.296 --> 00:34:01.096 A:middle
And remind you to call grandma
