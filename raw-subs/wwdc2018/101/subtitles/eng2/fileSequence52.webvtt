00:52:00.546 --> 00:52:05.036 A:middle
But we wanted to take Animoji

00:52:05.286 --> 00:52:07.566 A:middle
even further by making them even

00:52:07.566 --> 00:52:08.366 A:middle
more personal.

00:52:09.636 --> 00:52:11.676 A:middle
So I'm thrilled today to

00:52:11.676 --> 00:52:13.546 A:middle
announce the arrival of the era

00:52:13.546 --> 00:52:16.176 A:middle
of Memoji.

00:52:17.076 --> 00:52:17.696 A:middle
[applause] That's right.

00:52:19.486 --> 00:52:23.726 A:middle
With Memoji you can create your

00:52:23.816 --> 00:52:25.526 A:middle
very own personalized Animoji.

00:52:26.516 --> 00:52:31.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:52:32.046 --> 00:52:34.616 A:middle
Now, these Animoji can look like

00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:38.126 A:middle
you or the real you.

00:52:39.586 --> 00:52:41.816 A:middle
And we've worked hard to build a

00:52:41.966 --> 00:52:43.696 A:middle
deep set of customization

00:52:43.696 --> 00:52:45.216 A:middle
options to let our customers

00:52:45.466 --> 00:52:48.916 A:middle
create an incredibly diverse set

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.076 A:middle
of Memoji.

00:52:50.666 --> 00:52:52.296 A:middle
It's really incredible what you

00:52:52.296 --> 00:52:53.026 A:middle
can create.

00:52:54.106 --> 00:52:55.436 A:middle
And we've designed a beautiful

00:52:55.436 --> 00:52:57.026 A:middle
new experience to create these

00:52:57.026 --> 00:52:58.616 A:middle
Memoji that makes the process

00:52:58.756 --> 00:53:00.586 A:middle
fun and easy.
