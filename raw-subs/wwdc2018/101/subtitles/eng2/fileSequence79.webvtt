01:18:59.036 --> 01:19:02.026 A:middle
Now, I can tap it here and see

01:19:02.026 --> 01:19:03.756 A:middle
if she's found somewhere great

01:19:03.756 --> 01:19:04.966 A:middle
for us to go.

01:19:04.966 --> 01:19:06.536 A:middle
Oh yeah, this looks beautiful.

01:19:06.946 --> 01:19:08.616 A:middle
I'm already in, but I can

01:19:08.616 --> 01:19:09.986 A:middle
continue to scroll through the

01:19:09.986 --> 01:19:11.676 A:middle
site and maybe read a little bit

01:19:11.676 --> 01:19:13.556 A:middle
more about the retreat, even

01:19:13.556 --> 01:19:14.536 A:middle
check the dates to make sure

01:19:14.536 --> 01:19:15.136 A:middle
that they work.

01:19:15.136 --> 01:19:16.656 A:middle
And I can do all that right here

01:19:16.656 --> 01:19:18.796 A:middle
from my wrist.

01:19:19.516 --> 01:19:23.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:19:24.236 --> 01:19:25.536 A:middle
Let me show you the enhancements

01:19:25.536 --> 01:19:26.656 A:middle
that we've made to the new Siri

01:19:26.656 --> 01:19:27.156 A:middle
watch face.

01:19:27.256 --> 01:19:29.086 A:middle
At the top here, you see the

01:19:29.086 --> 01:19:30.366 A:middle
workout that I'm in right now,

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.216 A:middle
and when I'm ready to get back

01:19:32.216 --> 01:19:33.146 A:middle
to it, I can just tap.

01:19:33.796 --> 01:19:35.526 A:middle
Next up is Glow Baby, because

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:36.736 A:middle
it's about this time each day

01:19:36.736 --> 01:19:38.186 A:middle
that I check the app to see if

01:19:38.186 --> 01:19:39.176 A:middle
my husband has logged our

01:19:39.176 --> 01:19:39.816 A:middle
one-year-old's nap.

01:19:41.006 --> 01:19:42.156 A:middle
Oh, good job, baby.

01:19:42.156 --> 01:19:44.096 A:middle
You slept two hours, and you

01:19:44.096 --> 01:19:45.216 A:middle
parents know that good naps

01:19:45.346 --> 01:19:46.476 A:middle
equal good nights, so I'm

01:19:46.476 --> 01:19:48.326 A:middle
looking forward to that.

01:19:48.326 --> 01:19:50.716 A:middle
AR. As I scroll through my day,

01:19:50.816 --> 01:19:52.666 A:middle
I can see my next meeting.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:54.296 A:middle
I can see traffic and directions

01:19:54.296 --> 01:19:55.506 A:middle
to places that I'm going later

01:19:55.506 --> 01:19:55.956 A:middle
today.

01:19:55.956 --> 01:19:58.556 A:middle
Here's that dinner that Siri

found in my calendar, and
