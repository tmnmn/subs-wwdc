We love these updates, and we

00:43:02.276 --> 00:43:05.096 A:middle
think you will too, but we also

00:43:05.226 --> 00:43:08.926 A:middle
have a smart and safe way to use

00:43:08.926 --> 00:43:09.846 A:middle
your apps in the car.

00:43:09.986 --> 00:43:11.866 A:middle
I think you know I'm talking

00:43:11.866 --> 00:43:12.996 A:middle
about Car Play.

00:43:13.726 --> 00:43:14.976 A:middle
Car Play already supports

00:43:15.036 --> 00:43:16.676 A:middle
third-party audio and voice

00:43:16.796 --> 00:43:18.366 A:middle
messaging, you know, voice

00:43:18.366 --> 00:43:20.826 A:middle
calling and messaging apps, you

00:43:20.826 --> 00:43:21.446 A:middle
problem know that.

00:43:22.106 --> 00:43:23.546 A:middle
But what you might not know is

00:43:23.546 --> 00:43:26.226 A:middle
with IOS 12, Car Play will also

00:43:26.226 --> 00:43:27.886 A:middle
support third-party navigation

00:43:27.886 --> 00:43:27.976 A:middle
apps.

00:43:28.516 --> 00:43:34.346 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:36.396 A:middle
So now you have even more

00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:37.996 A:middle
choices when you use Car Play.

00:43:38.996 --> 00:43:40.386 A:middle
That is a really quick look at

00:43:40.386 --> 00:43:42.386 A:middle
some of our app dates, and

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:43.806 A:middle
Craig, back to you.

00:43:43.806 --> 00:43:43.873 A:middle
[applause]

00:43:43.873 --> 00:43:44.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Susan.

00:43:50.926 --> 00:43:52.526 A:middle
[applause] Well, now I'd like to

00:43:52.526 --> 00:43:53.766 A:middle
take a moment to talk about

00:43:53.766 --> 00:43:55.186 A:middle
something that's on a lot of

00:43:55.186 --> 00:43:56.576 A:middle
people's minds lately.

00:43:57.416 --> 00:43:59.646 A:middle
You know, iPhone and iPad are

00:43:59.646 --> 00:44:01.246 A:middle
some of the most powerful tools
