&gt;&gt; As a parent, no better thing

02:14:03.406 --> 02:14:04.396 A:middle
is letting your kids do what

02:14:04.396 --> 02:14:05.626 A:middle
they want to do, because it

02:14:05.686 --> 02:14:06.576 A:middle
isn't how much money you've

02:14:06.576 --> 02:14:06.906 A:middle
made.

02:14:07.056 --> 02:14:08.926 A:middle
It's really changes you've left

02:14:08.926 --> 02:14:09.466 A:middle

02:14:09.676 --> 02:14:11.336 A:middle

of change behind.

pleased that some of the

developers are in the audience

02:14:34.426 --> 02:14:35.136 A:middle
this morning.

02:14:35.656 --> 02:14:38.186 A:middle
Their stories are great examples

02:14:38.186 --> 02:14:40.886 A:middle
of all of your passion and your

02:14:40.886 --> 02:14:41.766 A:middle
creativity.

We love the work you do and the

02:14:45.216 --> 02:14:47.536 A:middle
impact that it has on the world.

02:14:48.336 --> 02:14:50.436 A:middle
