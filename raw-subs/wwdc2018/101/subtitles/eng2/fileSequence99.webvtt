01:38:58.166 --> 01:39:00.736 A:middle
Even mail in dark mode.

01:39:00.856 --> 01:39:01.626 A:middle
It's so great.

01:39:02.606 --> 01:39:04.206 A:middle
And I think some of us are going

01:39:04.206 --> 01:39:05.446 A:middle
to want to run dark mode just

01:39:05.446 --> 01:39:07.126 A:middle
because it's so cool.

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:09.826 A:middle
I mean your emoji look great.

01:39:09.826 --> 01:39:11.326 A:middle
Your photos look great.

01:39:11.516 --> 01:39:13.586 A:middle
I mean check out your album art

01:39:13.956 --> 01:39:16.766 A:middle
and music or your For You feed

01:39:17.406 --> 01:39:18.286 A:middle
in Apple Music.

01:39:18.706 --> 01:39:19.956 A:middle
But I think one audience that's

01:39:19.956 --> 01:39:21.366 A:middle
going to especially appreciate

01:39:21.366 --> 01:39:22.526 A:middle
dark mode are some of you here

01:39:22.526 --> 01:39:24.746 A:middle
in this room, our developers,

01:39:25.366 --> 01:39:26.796 A:middle
because Expo looks fantastic in

01:39:27.116 --> 01:39:27.656 A:middle
dark mode.

01:39:28.516 --> 01:39:33.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:39:33.596 --> 01:39:35.746 A:middle
Whether it's your source code or

01:39:35.746 --> 01:39:37.396 A:middle
even interface builder and all

01:39:37.396 --> 01:39:39.466 A:middle
of its inspectors, they just

01:39:39.466 --> 01:39:41.826 A:middle
look fantastic in black.

01:39:41.826 --> 01:39:44.666 A:middle
And that's a quick look at dark

01:39:44.666 --> 01:39:44.966 A:middle
mode.

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:49.286 A:middle
Now, we were so inspired by this

01:39:49.656 --> 01:39:51.926 A:middle
changing desktop wallpaper that

01:39:52.206 --> 01:39:53.576 A:middle
we decided to add a new feature

01:39:53.576 --> 01:39:54.966 A:middle
to Mojave that I think you'll

01:39:54.966 --> 01:39:55.726 A:middle
enjoy.

01:39:56.396 --> 01:39:58.676 A:middle
It's called dynamic desktop, and

01:39:58.676 --> 01:39:59.576 A:middle
when you're using it, you're

01:39:59.576 --> 01:40:01.836 A:middle
desktop actually subtly changes
