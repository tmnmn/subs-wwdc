02:01:59.356 --> 02:02:01.366 A:middle
with Metal is in machine

02:02:01.366 --> 02:02:01.756 A:middle
learning.

02:02:02.236 --> 02:02:04.886 A:middle
And today ML specialists usually

02:02:04.886 --> 02:02:07.336 A:middle
use one of these third-party

02:02:07.336 --> 02:02:09.116 A:middle
libraries to train their models

02:02:09.206 --> 02:02:11.396 A:middle
using servers, and now it turns

02:02:11.396 --> 02:02:13.236 A:middle
out we can accelerate tools like

02:02:13.306 --> 02:02:14.476 A:middle
this with our new Metal

02:02:14.476 --> 02:02:15.866 A:middle
performance shaders.

02:02:16.036 --> 02:02:17.616 A:middle
We're seeing speedups of up to

02:02:17.616 --> 02:02:20.176 A:middle
20 times and using the GPU with

02:02:20.176 --> 02:02:21.606 A:middle
Metal instead of CPU-based

02:02:21.606 --> 02:02:22.166 A:middle
training.

02:02:22.496 --> 02:02:23.826 A:middle
And while speeding these tools

02:02:23.826 --> 02:02:25.446 A:middle
up is great, we actually thing

02:02:25.446 --> 02:02:26.916 A:middle
there's a better way for most

02:02:26.916 --> 02:02:29.226 A:middle
developers, and that's training

02:02:29.226 --> 02:02:31.146 A:middle
on the Mac you already have

02:02:31.496 --> 02:02:33.836 A:middle
using a great new tool we call

02:02:33.836 --> 02:02:34.726 A:middle
Create ML.

02:02:35.516 --> 02:02:39.536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

02:02:40.036 --> 02:02:41.816 A:middle
Now, Create ML is designed to

02:02:41.906 --> 02:02:43.816 A:middle
let you train without being a

02:02:43.816 --> 02:02:45.126 A:middle
machine learning expert.

02:02:45.566 --> 02:02:47.466 A:middle
You can train vision and natural

02:02:47.496 --> 02:02:48.366 A:middle
language models.

02:02:48.366 --> 02:02:49.926 A:middle
You can bring your own custom

02:02:49.926 --> 02:02:51.186 A:middle
data, and it's really easy to

02:02:51.186 --> 02:02:52.826 A:middle
use because it's all built in

02:02:52.826 --> 02:02:53.946 A:middle
Swift.

02:02:53.946 --> 02:02:55.246 A:middle
In fact, you can use Xcode

02:02:55.326 --> 02:02:56.706 A:middle
Playgrounds to train your model.

02:02:56.746 --> 02:02:58.846 A:middle
Just drag one in, you're

02:02:58.846 --> 02:03:00.326 A:middle
training set, you can drag in
