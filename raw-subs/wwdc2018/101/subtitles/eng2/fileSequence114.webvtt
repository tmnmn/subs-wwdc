like its configuration, its

01:54:02.416 --> 01:54:04.066 A:middle
fonts that you have installed

01:54:04.066 --> 01:54:05.686 A:middle
and the plug-insulin that you

01:54:05.686 --> 01:54:06.686 A:middle
might have on the device.

01:54:06.686 --> 01:54:08.666 A:middle
And these data companies can use

01:54:08.666 --> 01:54:10.136 A:middle
the set of characteristics to

01:54:10.136 --> 01:54:11.736 A:middle
construct a unique fingerprint

01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:14.266 A:middle
to track your device from site

01:54:14.506 --> 01:54:14.976 A:middle
to site.

01:54:16.666 --> 01:54:17.896 A:middle
With Mojave, we're making it

01:54:17.896 --> 01:54:20.176 A:middle
much harder for trackers to

01:54:20.216 --> 01:54:21.276 A:middle
create a unique fingerprint.

01:54:22.006 --> 01:54:23.306 A:middle
We're presenting webpages with

01:54:23.306 --> 01:54:24.816 A:middle
only a simplified system

01:54:24.816 --> 01:54:25.606 A:middle
configuration.

01:54:26.486 --> 01:54:27.806 A:middle
We show them only built-in

01:54:27.876 --> 01:54:30.426 A:middle
fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin

01:54:30.426 --> 01:54:31.426 A:middle
are no longer supported, so

01:54:31.426 --> 01:54:32.696 A:middle
those can't contribute to a

01:54:32.776 --> 01:54:34.736 A:middle
fingerprint, and as a result,

01:54:34.736 --> 01:54:36.666 A:middle
your Mac will look more like

01:54:36.666 --> 01:54:38.286 A:middle
everyone else's Mac, and it will

01:54:38.286 --> 01:54:39.936 A:middle
be dramatically more difficult

01:54:39.936 --> 01:54:41.296 A:middle
for data companies to uniquely

01:54:41.296 --> 01:54:42.806 A:middle
identify your device and track

01:54:42.806 --> 01:54:42.873 A:middle
you.

01:54:43.516 --> 01:54:51.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:54:52.146 --> 01:54:53.476 A:middle
Now, we're bringing all of these

01:54:53.576 --> 01:54:55.306 A:middle
new protections to Safari on

01:54:55.456 --> 01:54:58.266 A:middle
both Mojave and iOS 12.

01:54:58.966 --> 01:55:01.426 A:middle
Next, let's talk about the mac
