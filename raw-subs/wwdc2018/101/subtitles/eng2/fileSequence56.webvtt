00:55:59.636 --> 00:56:01.736 A:middle
I've a message here from my

00:56:01.736 --> 00:56:02.446 A:middle
partner.

00:56:02.806 --> 00:56:04.506 A:middle
It looks like he's informing me

00:56:04.506 --> 00:56:05.846 A:middle
that he's bought our dog,

00:56:05.846 --> 00:56:08.636 A:middle
Ferdinand, yet another tiny dog

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:08.866 A:middle
hat.

00:56:09.446 --> 00:56:10.436 A:middle
This isn't even the first.

00:56:10.436 --> 00:56:12.786 A:middle
I think this is the perfect

00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:14.446 A:middle
opportunity for a response with

00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:15.966 A:middle
this new fun camera.

00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:17.836 A:middle
So I'll tap to pull up the

00:56:17.836 --> 00:56:19.576 A:middle
camera, and then I can see this

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:20.926 A:middle
little star over here on the

00:56:20.926 --> 00:56:21.146 A:middle
left.

00:56:22.286 --> 00:56:24.316 A:middle
Tapping on that gives me a strip

00:56:24.316 --> 00:56:25.756 A:middle
with all sorts of new effects.

00:56:26.446 --> 00:56:27.686 A:middle
So I could add things like

00:56:27.686 --> 00:56:29.256 A:middle
shapes or text.

00:56:30.166 --> 00:56:33.076 A:middle
But let's check out these

00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:33.916 A:middle
filters.

00:56:34.006 --> 00:56:35.616 A:middle
Ooh. So this is comic book.

00:56:35.616 --> 00:56:37.536 A:middle
It's really fun, but for a

00:56:37.536 --> 00:56:40.096 A:middle
response about a tiny dog hat, I

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.326 A:middle
think I'm going to go in a

00:56:41.326 --> 00:56:42.926 A:middle
different artistic direction.

00:56:44.236 --> 00:56:45.786 A:middle
So what I really need to do is

00:56:45.786 --> 00:56:47.016 A:middle
add a sticker from one of my

00:56:47.016 --> 00:56:48.066 A:middle
favorite sticker packs.

00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:51.026 A:middle
Ferdy looked really excited

00:56:51.026 --> 00:56:53.186 A:middle
about that new dog hat, so I'm

00:56:53.186 --> 00:56:56.656 A:middle
going to put him right here, and

00:56:56.656 --> 00:56:58.676 A:middle
now we have an all new way for

00:56:58.676 --> 00:57:00.406 A:middle
you to use Animoji.
