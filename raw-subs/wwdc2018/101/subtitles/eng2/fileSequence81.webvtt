01:20:57.976 --> 01:21:00.656 A:middle
AR. The time is now to check in

01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:02.606 A:middle
on this competition and see if I

01:21:02.606 --> 01:21:04.246 A:middle
have done enough to pull ahead.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.046 A:middle
I'm going to tap into activity

01:21:06.206 --> 01:21:07.466 A:middle
and swipe over to see the score.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:08.976 A:middle
Oh, yes.

01:21:09.516 --> 01:21:15.226 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:21:15.726 --> 01:21:17.826 A:middle
Sorry Jay, but the day is still

01:21:17.826 --> 01:21:17.996 A:middle
young.

01:21:17.996 --> 01:21:19.486 A:middle
Thanks everybody, and back to

01:21:19.486 --> 01:21:19.826 A:middle
you, Kevin.

01:21:27.356 --> 01:21:28.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Way to go, Jules.

01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:30.546 A:middle
So in watchOS 5 we've enabled

01:21:30.546 --> 01:21:32.206 A:middle
even deeper integration on the

01:21:32.206 --> 01:21:34.026 A:middle
watch for apps, enabling them to

01:21:34.026 --> 01:21:35.126 A:middle
work right in the moment.

01:21:35.126 --> 01:21:37.276 A:middle
And apps can include interactive

01:21:37.276 --> 01:21:39.036 A:middle
controls within notifications so

01:21:39.156 --> 01:21:40.636 A:middle
you can quickly do more without

01:21:40.636 --> 01:21:42.186 A:middle
even opening an app like extend

01:21:42.186 --> 01:21:43.336 A:middle
your parking with Pay by Phone.

01:21:43.436 --> 01:21:45.366 A:middle
And with Shortcuts, there's also

01:21:45.366 --> 01:21:46.216 A:middle
new opportunities for

01:21:46.306 --> 01:21:47.826 A:middle
third-party apps to appear on

01:21:47.826 --> 01:21:48.966 A:middle
Apple Watch right on the watch

01:21:48.966 --> 01:21:49.196 A:middle
face.

01:21:49.636 --> 01:21:50.836 A:middle
You can tap on a shortcut on the

01:21:50.836 --> 01:21:52.846 A:middle
Siri face to order coffee, rent

01:21:52.846 --> 01:21:54.046 A:middle
a bike, or pick up where you

01:21:54.046 --> 01:21:55.426 A:middle
left off in a workout.

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:56.756 A:middle
You can even use your custom

01:21:56.756 --> 01:21:58.456 A:middle
Siri commands that you created

01:21:58.456 --> 01:21:59.986 A:middle
on your phone to speak on your

01:21:59.986 --> 01:22:00.416 A:middle
watch.
