02:05:58.816 --> 02:06:00.136 A:middle
enrich the Mac user's

02:06:00.136 --> 02:06:00.906 A:middle
experience.

02:06:01.416 --> 02:06:03.006 A:middle
But we think there's room for

02:06:03.006 --> 02:06:05.166 A:middle
one more, and so we'd like to

02:06:05.166 --> 02:06:06.656 A:middle
give you a sneak peek of a

02:06:06.656 --> 02:06:08.676 A:middle
multiyear project we have going

02:06:08.676 --> 02:06:08.916 A:middle
on.

02:06:09.416 --> 02:06:10.846 A:middle
Because we see a huge

02:06:10.846 --> 02:06:12.396 A:middle
opportunity for the Mac to tap

02:06:12.396 --> 02:06:14.126 A:middle
into the world's most vital app

02:06:14.126 --> 02:06:14.866 A:middle
ecosystem.

02:06:15.676 --> 02:06:16.416 A:middle
It's called iOS.

02:06:16.756 --> 02:06:18.316 A:middle
I think you might be familiar

02:06:18.316 --> 02:06:18.816 A:middle
with it.

02:06:19.306 --> 02:06:21.046 A:middle
Now, there are millions of iOS

02:06:21.126 --> 02:06:22.466 A:middle
apps out there, and we think

02:06:22.636 --> 02:06:24.206 A:middle
some of them would be absolutely

02:06:24.206 --> 02:06:26.886 A:middle
great on the Mac, and Mac users

02:06:26.886 --> 02:06:28.366 A:middle
would love to have them there.

02:06:28.416 --> 02:06:30.546 A:middle
And from a technical standpoint,

02:06:30.956 --> 02:06:32.436 A:middle
it's actually a really good fit

02:06:32.436 --> 02:06:34.476 A:middle
because from day one iOS and

02:06:34.476 --> 02:06:35.856 A:middle
macOS have shared common

02:06:35.896 --> 02:06:36.706 A:middle
foundations.

02:06:37.536 --> 02:06:39.626 A:middle
But iOS devices and Mac devices

02:06:39.626 --> 02:06:41.006 A:middle
of course are different, and the

02:06:41.006 --> 02:06:42.606 A:middle
user interfaces are somewhat

02:06:42.606 --> 02:06:44.066 A:middle
different and so the frameworks

02:06:44.066 --> 02:06:45.336 A:middle
underneath are as well.

02:06:45.336 --> 02:06:46.686 A:middle
And that makes today porting an

02:06:46.836 --> 02:06:49.016 A:middle
app from one to the other some

02:06:49.016 --> 02:06:49.396 A:middle
work.

02:06:50.276 --> 02:06:51.766 A:middle
We wanted to make this much

02:06:51.866 --> 02:06:54.646 A:middle
easier, and so we've taken some

02:06:54.766 --> 02:06:57.506 A:middle
key frameworks from iOS and

02:06:57.506 --> 02:06:58.546 A:middle
brought them to the Mac.

02:06:59.546 --> 02:07:01.016 A:middle
And we've adapted them to
