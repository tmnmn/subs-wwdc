01:58:59.886 --> 01:59:03.506 A:middle
And Bare Bones is bringing BB

01:59:03.506 --> 01:59:03.906 A:middle
Edit.

01:59:04.326 --> 01:59:07.326 A:middle
[applause] And many more great

01:59:07.386 --> 01:59:09.096 A:middle
names are coming to the all-new

01:59:09.096 --> 01:59:10.346 A:middle
Mac App Store too.

01:59:11.106 --> 01:59:12.446 A:middle
We can't wait for you to check

01:59:12.446 --> 01:59:13.816 A:middle
out the new Mac App Store.

01:59:14.226 --> 01:59:16.176 A:middle
Now, I'll hand it back to Craig.

01:59:17.516 --> 01:59:23.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:59:23.506 --> 01:59:25.066 A:middle
So we think the Mac App Store is

01:59:25.066 --> 01:59:26.606 A:middle
going to inspire whole-new

01:59:26.606 --> 01:59:28.596 A:middle
generations of apps, and so we

01:59:28.596 --> 01:59:29.956 A:middle
want to talk about some of the

01:59:29.956 --> 01:59:32.416 A:middle
technologies that will be behind

01:59:32.746 --> 01:59:34.426 A:middle
some of that next generation.

01:59:34.826 --> 01:59:36.726 A:middle
We spoke earlier about ARKit.

01:59:36.816 --> 01:59:38.906 A:middle
I want to talk about two more.

01:59:39.716 --> 01:59:41.526 A:middle
And let's start with Metal.

01:59:42.386 --> 01:59:44.016 A:middle
Now Metal is the technology to

01:59:44.016 --> 01:59:45.416 A:middle
get the highest performance

01:59:45.446 --> 01:59:47.656 A:middle
graphics and computation from

01:59:47.656 --> 01:59:48.866 A:middle
graphics processors.

01:59:49.306 --> 01:59:50.766 A:middle
Metal was designed for modern

01:59:50.986 --> 01:59:51.216 A:middle
GPUs.

01:59:51.216 --> 01:59:54.266 A:middle
It's incredibly efficient, and

01:59:54.266 --> 01:59:55.346 A:middle
that enables amazing

01:59:55.346 --> 01:59:56.936 A:middle
console-level games like

01:59:57.076 --> 01:59:59.556 A:middle
Fortnight from Epic to run great

01:59:59.556 --> 02:00:01.776 A:middle
for the first time on mobile.
