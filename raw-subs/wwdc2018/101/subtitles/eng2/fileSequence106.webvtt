01:45:57.036 --> 01:46:01.246 A:middle
can just drag that out.

01:46:01.506 --> 01:46:04.466 A:middle
Magnify. It's that easy.

01:46:04.776 --> 01:46:06.206 A:middle
But now we've also made it

01:46:06.206 --> 01:46:08.066 A:middle
easier to access a variety of

01:46:08.066 --> 01:46:09.986 A:middle
tools, so when I bring up my

01:46:09.986 --> 01:46:12.106 A:middle
screenshotting, you see I'm

01:46:12.106 --> 01:46:13.966 A:middle
presented with this hud that

01:46:13.966 --> 01:46:15.196 A:middle
tells me I can capture the

01:46:15.196 --> 01:46:17.906 A:middle
entire screen, a selected window

01:46:17.906 --> 01:46:19.886 A:middle
or selection, but we've also

01:46:19.886 --> 01:46:22.336 A:middle
added screen capture for video

01:46:22.806 --> 01:46:24.646 A:middle
right into screenshotting.

01:46:24.856 --> 01:46:26.266 A:middle
Let me show you how that works.

01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:27.936 A:middle
So I'm going to go to a webpage

01:46:27.936 --> 01:46:29.456 A:middle
here that has an animation

01:46:29.456 --> 01:46:29.746 A:middle
running.

01:46:30.106 --> 01:46:31.476 A:middle
I'm going to bring up my

01:46:31.476 --> 01:46:33.496 A:middle
screenshotting tools, and say

01:46:33.686 --> 01:46:36.016 A:middle
record the selected area.

01:46:36.496 --> 01:46:37.936 A:middle
I'll just make a nice selection

01:46:37.936 --> 01:46:38.156 A:middle
here.

01:46:39.186 --> 01:46:40.786 A:middle
Okay. And I'm recording just

01:46:40.786 --> 01:46:41.836 A:middle
like that.

01:46:41.836 --> 01:46:43.026 A:middle
Of course I can manipulate the

01:46:43.026 --> 01:46:45.376 A:middle
app, so all will be reflected in

01:46:45.376 --> 01:46:48.416 A:middle
my recording, and when I'm done,

01:46:48.416 --> 01:46:49.546 A:middle
I can click the stop button

01:46:49.546 --> 01:46:50.466 A:middle
right up here.

01:46:50.866 --> 01:46:51.726 A:middle
And now you notice I have this

01:46:51.806 --> 01:46:53.006 A:middle
thumbnail in the lower right.

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:55.706 A:middle
Well I can actually pick this up

01:46:55.856 --> 01:46:57.656 A:middle
and drag it into a new space and

01:46:57.856 --> 01:46:59.866 A:middle
incorporate it right into a

01:46:59.866 --> 01:47:01.866 A:middle
document, just like that.
