room with Aerials.

01:32:02.336 --> 01:32:03.676 A:middle
Now, one of the questions I get

01:32:03.676 --> 01:32:05.336 A:middle
asked the most about Aerials,

01:32:05.336 --> 01:32:06.826 A:middle
especially by my family members

01:32:06.826 --> 01:32:08.506 A:middle
is where is this?

01:32:08.786 --> 01:32:10.956 A:middle
Well, this ball with just a tap

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:13.116 A:middle
of the Siri remote, you'll now

01:32:13.116 --> 01:32:15.226 A:middle
be able to see every Arial

01:32:15.226 --> 01:32:15.676 A:middle

[ Applause ]

01:32:21.626 --> 01:32:23.186 A:middle
And, you can even swipe between

01:32:23.186 --> 01:32:25.486 A:middle
locations so you can see even

01:32:25.486 --> 01:32:25.796 A:middle
more.

01:32:25.796 --> 01:32:29.486 A:middle
And today, I have an incredible

01:32:29.486 --> 01:32:31.136 A:middle
new location to share with you.

01:32:31.136 --> 01:32:34.406 A:middle
For the past year, we've been

01:32:34.406 --> 01:32:36.076 A:middle
collaborating closely with an

01:32:36.076 --> 01:32:38.046 A:middle
amazing partner, filming some

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:39.676 A:middle
stunning footage from around the

01:32:39.676 --> 01:32:42.216 A:middle
world with a very unique vantage

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:46.716 A:middle
point, and here it is.

01:32:46.906 --> 01:32:46.986 A:middle
Earth.
