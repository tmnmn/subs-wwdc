00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.526 A:middle
So, you will be able to bring in

00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:04.076 A:middle
images, videos, text, any object

00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:06.576 A:middle
from Creative Cloud directly

00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:08.236 A:middle
into a native AR environment.

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:11.726 A:middle
In fact, for the first time with

00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:14.126 A:middle
Creative Cloud and iOS, you will

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.406 A:middle
have a what you see is what you

00:18:16.406 --> 00:18:18.906 A:middle
get editing in AR.

00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:19.876 A:middle
It's pretty cool.

00:18:20.086 --> 00:18:25.536 A:middle
So, come join this afternoon

00:18:25.536 --> 00:18:26.766 A:middle
State of the Union where we're

00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:28.246 A:middle
able to give you a sneak peak of

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:29.666 A:middle
some of these new immersive

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:31.346 A:middle
design tools for the first time.

00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:33.036 A:middle
Thanks. Back to you Craig.

00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:35.361 A:middle
[applause]

00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:36.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Abhay.

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:40.536 A:middle
[applause] Now a critical part

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.816 A:middle
of enabling AR is accurate

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:44.756 A:middle
measurement, and fortunately the

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.856 A:middle
precise calibration of sensors

00:18:46.946 --> 00:18:49.046 A:middle
in iOS devices and our tight

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:50.746 A:middle
hardware software integration

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:52.456 A:middle
mean that we do this really

00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:54.056 A:middle
well, and we want to enable

00:18:54.056 --> 00:18:55.776 A:middle
everyone to take advantage of

00:18:55.776 --> 00:18:56.746 A:middle
this capability.

00:18:57.076 --> 00:18:59.316 A:middle
So we're introducing a new app,

00:18:59.836 --> 00:19:01.376 A:middle
and it's called Measure.
