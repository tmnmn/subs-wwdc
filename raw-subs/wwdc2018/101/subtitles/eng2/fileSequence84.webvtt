01:24:01.926 --> 01:24:04.966 A:middle
Next up is Apple TV.

01:24:05.336 --> 01:24:10.036 A:middle
Last September, we introduced

01:24:10.036 --> 01:24:12.476 A:middle
Apple TV 4K, and our customers

01:24:12.476 --> 01:24:12.936 A:middle
love it.

01:24:13.556 --> 01:24:14.986 A:middle
Since its introduction, the

01:24:14.986 --> 01:24:16.976 A:middle
Apple TV business has grown an

01:24:16.976 --> 01:24:19.036 A:middle
incredible 50 percent.

01:24:19.966 --> 01:24:21.656 A:middle
Today, we've got some great new

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:24.056 A:middle
enhancements to Apple TV 4K and

01:24:24.056 --> 01:24:25.616 A:middle
tvOS, and we think you're going

01:24:25.616 --> 01:24:26.426 A:middle
to love them.

01:24:26.706 --> 01:24:29.726 A:middle
So I'd like to invite Apple TV

01:24:29.726 --> 01:24:31.726 A:middle
lead designer, Jen Fuls

01:24:31.726 --> 01:24:32.716 A:middle
[phonetic] to the stage to tell

01:24:32.716 --> 01:24:33.446 A:middle
you all about it.

01:24:33.626 --> 01:24:34.026 A:middle
Jen. [applause]

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:35.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Tim.

01:24:36.516 --> 01:24:39.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:41.406 A:middle
Apple TV is built on an

01:24:41.406 --> 01:24:43.756 A:middle
incredible platform, tvOS.

01:24:43.886 --> 01:24:46.746 A:middle
And tvOS is built specifically

01:24:46.776 --> 01:24:48.196 A:middle
for the living room, to make it

01:24:48.196 --> 01:24:50.196 A:middle
easy to enjoy your favorite TV

01:24:50.196 --> 01:24:52.876 A:middle
shows, movies, apps, and games.

01:24:53.536 --> 01:24:54.716 A:middle
Now as Tim mentioned, last

01:24:54.906 --> 01:24:56.886 A:middle
September, we introduced Apple

01:24:56.886 --> 01:24:59.526 A:middle

01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:01.286 A:middle
