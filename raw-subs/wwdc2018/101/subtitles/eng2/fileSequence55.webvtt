Maybe not for today.

00:55:07.326 --> 00:55:10.096 A:middle
I think I need two lenses.

00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:12.136 A:middle
These are the ones.

00:55:12.506 --> 00:55:13.796 A:middle
Now that I have frames, I'm

00:55:13.796 --> 00:55:15.266 A:middle
going to tint my lenses to make

00:55:15.266 --> 00:55:16.616 A:middle

00:55:30.646 --> 00:55:32.856 A:middle

the rest of my team.

00:55:36.176 --> 00:55:37.946 A:middle
And that's how simple it is to

This wasn't even in Craig's
