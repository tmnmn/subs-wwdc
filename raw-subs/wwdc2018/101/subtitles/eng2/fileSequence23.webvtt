Now this delivers true,

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:02.996 A:middle
multiuser augmented reality.

00:23:03.726 --> 00:23:04.986 A:middle
You and the people around you

00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.416 A:middle
will be able to see your own

00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:08.396 A:middle
perspective on a common virtual

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:08.916 A:middle
environment.

00:23:09.306 --> 00:23:10.526 A:middle
And to help all you developers

00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:12.686 A:middle
get started, we created this

00:23:12.816 --> 00:23:14.506 A:middle
sample app written in Swift that

00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:16.106 A:middle
you'll all be getting today.

00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:18.376 A:middle
Now, check out how both players

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.426 A:middle
and even a third observer can

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:21.676 A:middle
all experience the same

00:23:21.676 --> 00:23:22.906 A:middle
environment in real time.

00:23:23.006 --> 00:23:23.796 A:middle
It's really fun.

00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:31.456 A:middle
Now, we've also brought in a

00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:33.266 A:middle
select few developers into our

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:34.426 A:middle
labs over the last couple of

00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:36.736 A:middle
weeks to work with ARKit, and

00:23:36.736 --> 00:23:37.596 A:middle
they love it.

00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:39.566 A:middle
Now, one of them is Lego.

00:23:40.066 --> 00:23:42.106 A:middle
And what they've done is so fun,

00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:44.196 A:middle
you just need to see it.

00:23:44.516 --> 00:23:46.216 A:middle
So I'm pleased to invite Martin

00:23:46.326 --> 00:23:48.316 A:middle

00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:49.716 A:middle
of Lego, to the stage to give

00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.226 A:middle
you a live demonstration.

00:23:51.376 --> 00:23:51.676 A:middle
