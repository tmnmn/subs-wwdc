00:59:59.226 --> 01:00:00.326 A:middle
the lower right-hand corner.

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:01.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey Craig.

01:00:02.206 --> 01:00:03.766 A:middle
Wait, am I on the big screen?

01:00:04.236 --> 01:00:05.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes, Lauren, this is not a

01:00:05.726 --> 01:00:06.636 A:middle
test.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.406 A:middle
You're in front of 6000 of your

01:00:08.406 --> 01:00:08.976 A:middle
biggest new fans.

01:00:09.516 --> 01:00:14.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:00:15.426 --> 01:00:17.616 A:middle
Now, what you probably notice is

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:19.066 A:middle
when Lauren spoke, her tile

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:20.996 A:middle
automatically got larger to

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:22.716 A:middle
reflect her prominence in the

01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:23.416 A:middle
conversation.

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:25.216 A:middle
This is totally automatic.

01:00:25.486 --> 01:00:26.736 A:middle
Hey Roberto, how's it going back

01:00:26.776 --> 01:00:27.616 A:middle
there in Cupertino?

01:00:28.366 --> 01:00:30.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'd say it's going pretty

01:00:30.446 --> 01:00:32.196 A:middle
well, and Lauren, sorry for

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.166 A:middle
stealing your spotlight.

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:35.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So this works of course for

01:00:35.296 --> 01:00:37.146 A:middle
people in the roster as well.

01:00:37.146 --> 01:00:38.076 A:middle
When they speak, they come

01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:38.526 A:middle
forward.

01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:39.746 A:middle
Hey Christopher, you ready to

01:00:39.746 --> 01:00:40.546 A:middle
make your big entrance?

01:00:40.586 --> 01:00:43.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Finally, my moment has come.

01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:43.876 A:middle
Hello world.

01:00:43.976 --> 01:00:47.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, well done.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:51.456 A:middle
Now you can control this too, so

01:00:51.496 --> 01:00:52.736 A:middle
I want to bring Woody front and

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:55.026 A:middle
center, I just double tab.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:55.846 A:middle
There he is.

01:00:58.426 --> 01:00:59.826 A:middle
Woody, your baby is performing

01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:01.016 A:middle
admirably here.
