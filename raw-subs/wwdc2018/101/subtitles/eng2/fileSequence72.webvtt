01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:01.096 A:middle
one-time request to allow a

01:12:01.096 --> 01:12:02.216 A:middle
walkie talkie connection with

01:12:02.246 --> 01:12:02.496 A:middle
you.

01:12:02.836 --> 01:12:04.226 A:middle
If they accept, then you can

01:12:04.226 --> 01:12:05.206 A:middle
speak to each other with walkie

01:12:05.206 --> 01:12:06.206 A:middle
talkie whenever you like.

01:12:06.206 --> 01:12:08.426 A:middle
And to do this, you just press

01:12:08.466 --> 01:12:10.526 A:middle
to talk, and then your friend

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.906 A:middle
can hear your voice just like a

01:12:11.906 --> 01:12:12.486 A:middle
walkie talkie.

01:12:12.486 --> 01:12:14.856 A:middle
And they're going to feel a

01:12:14.856 --> 01:12:15.546 A:middle
[inaudible] beep beep sound

01:12:15.546 --> 01:12:16.536 A:middle
right before your voice comes

01:12:16.536 --> 01:12:16.906 A:middle
out.

01:12:16.906 --> 01:12:18.436 A:middle
And this new watch-to-watch

01:12:18.436 --> 01:12:19.926 A:middle
connection works over cellular

01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:21.576 A:middle
or Wi-Fi, and it has really high

01:12:21.576 --> 01:12:22.366 A:middle
audio quality.

01:12:22.366 --> 01:12:23.336 A:middle
And it's a lot of fun.

01:12:23.336 --> 01:12:24.326 A:middle
We can't wait for you to try

01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:24.906 A:middle
this out.

01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:25.816 A:middle
That's walkie talkie.

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:31.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:12:32.186 --> 01:12:33.326 A:middle
Now last year we introduced a

01:12:33.326 --> 01:12:34.766 A:middle
Siri watch face, which presents

01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:35.766 A:middle
the right information to you at

01:12:35.766 --> 01:12:36.456 A:middle
the right time.

01:12:36.856 --> 01:12:38.266 A:middle
And Siri does this using machine

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:39.136 A:middle
learning, so it's going to get

01:12:39.136 --> 01:12:40.006 A:middle
better at predicting your

01:12:40.006 --> 01:12:41.726 A:middle
actions over time by combining

01:12:41.726 --> 01:12:43.536 A:middle
inputs like the time of day,

01:12:43.536 --> 01:12:44.896 A:middle
your location, your daily

01:12:44.896 --> 01:12:46.296 A:middle
routines, or which apps you use

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:46.566 A:middle
when.

01:12:46.966 --> 01:12:47.836 A:middle
We're making some great

01:12:47.836 --> 01:12:49.436 A:middle
enhancements to the Siri watch

01:12:49.436 --> 01:12:49.916 A:middle
face now.

01:12:50.836 --> 01:12:52.036 A:middle
First, we're adding new content.

01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:53.456 A:middle
So now you can get live sports

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:55.016 A:middle
scores, you can get commute time

01:12:55.016 --> 01:12:56.756 A:middle
home or to work, or you can see

01:12:56.756 --> 01:12:58.086 A:middle
your heart rate, for example,

01:12:58.086 --> 01:12:59.676 A:middle
after a workout or your resting

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:00.766 A:middle
heart rate.
