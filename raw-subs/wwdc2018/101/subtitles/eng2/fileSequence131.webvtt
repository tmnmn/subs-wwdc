02:10:59.416 --> 02:11:00.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Homework, you talk to her.

02:11:01.046 --> 02:11:01.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My brother Derek created

02:11:02.066 --> 02:11:04.216 A:middle
the app Refugees and Immigrants

02:11:04.216 --> 02:11:05.976 A:middle
the creative, the collective.

02:11:06.046 --> 02:11:08.976 A:middle
Why did I say the creative.

02:11:09.066 --> 02:11:09.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; At Christmastime, when most

02:11:10.046 --> 02:11:11.966 A:middle
kids maybe would want skis or

02:11:11.966 --> 02:11:13.776 A:middle
something, he wanted computer

02:11:13.776 --> 02:11:13.976 A:middle
books.

02:11:14.046 --> 02:11:16.676 A:middle
He stayed in his bedroom, making

02:11:16.676 --> 02:11:18.176 A:middle
games while the other kids were

02:11:18.176 --> 02:11:18.956 A:middle
outside playing.

02:11:19.066 --> 02:11:20.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And when she is really doing

02:11:20.636 --> 02:11:22.386 A:middle
the coding almost always we have

02:11:22.386 --> 02:11:23.976 A:middle
to tell my daughter to stop,

02:11:24.046 --> 02:11:24.986 A:middle
but then my daughter will be

02:11:24.986 --> 02:11:27.126 A:middle
like, just give me another ten

02:11:27.126 --> 02:11:27.586 A:middle
minutes.

02:11:27.586 --> 02:11:28.976 A:middle
I want to get this solved first.

02:11:29.046 --> 02:11:30.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When I watch him code, his

02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:34.896 A:middle
eyes move in a weird way, and

02:11:34.896 --> 02:11:36.806 A:middle
he's like totally focused.

02:11:37.266 --> 02:11:38.816 A:middle
Even when my friends are over,

02:11:38.816 --> 02:11:39.626 A:middle
I'd say, we'll look at

02:11:39.706 --> 02:11:42.046 A:middle
Christopher, look at him.

02:11:42.046 --> 02:11:42.826 A:middle
And they'd go, wow.

02:11:45.046 --> 02:11:45.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When he first came to us with

02:11:46.056 --> 02:11:48.536 A:middle
the idea, we were like, okay,

02:11:48.536 --> 02:11:48.956 A:middle
good luck.

02:11:50.496 --> 02:11:51.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; He started off in his small

02:11:51.906 --> 02:11:52.976 A:middle
little one-bedroom apartment

02:11:52.976 --> 02:11:53.976 A:middle
with next to nothing,

02:11:54.576 --> 02:11:56.686 A:middle
and sacrificed eating a burger

02:11:56.686 --> 02:11:58.136 A:middle
and just have ramen just so that

02:11:58.136 --> 02:12:00.676 A:middle
he could, and I'm like just buy
