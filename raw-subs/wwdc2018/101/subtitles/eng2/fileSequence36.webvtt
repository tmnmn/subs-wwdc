00:35:58.536 --> 00:36:00.906 A:middle
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

00:36:01.756 --> 00:36:01.826 A:middle
it.

00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:05.936 A:middle
Perfect. I also want to show you

00:36:05.936 --> 00:36:07.616 A:middle
how you can add a shortcut to

00:36:07.716 --> 00:36:08.166 A:middle
Siri.

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:09.726 A:middle
So let's take a look at Kayak.

00:36:09.916 --> 00:36:12.766 A:middle
I keep all of my travel details

00:36:12.766 --> 00:36:13.386 A:middle
in Kayak.

00:36:13.586 --> 00:36:15.246 A:middle
Most important is my post WWDC

00:36:15.246 --> 00:36:17.646 A:middle
relaxation trip to Los Angeles.

00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:19.766 A:middle
You can see I have got my

00:36:19.926 --> 00:36:21.766 A:middle
flight, my hotel, all the

00:36:21.766 --> 00:36:23.336 A:middle
details, everything I need, but

00:36:23.336 --> 00:36:24.806 A:middle
what I really want is to be able

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:26.096 A:middle
to use this and get to this

00:36:26.096 --> 00:36:27.886 A:middle
information with my voice while

00:36:27.886 --> 00:36:29.146 A:middle
I'm on the go.

00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:31.256 A:middle
So, let's head back, and I can

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:34.026 A:middle
just tap add to Siri, record my

00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:36.946 A:middle
custom phrase, travel plans

00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:40.566 A:middle
[beep], and I'm done.

00:36:40.566 --> 00:36:42.796 A:middle
So now when I land at the

00:36:42.796 --> 00:36:44.466 A:middle
airport and I'm about to get in

00:36:44.466 --> 00:36:45.996 A:middle
a cab and I could really use

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.736 A:middle
that hotel address, I can just

00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:52.186 A:middle
say, travel plans.

00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:54.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Kayak says your hotel is at

00:36:54.356 --> 00:36:56.176 A:middle
929 South Broadway.

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:58.236 A:middle
You can check in after 3 p.m.

00:36:58.236 --> 00:36:59.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Isn't that cool?

00:36:59.766 --> 00:37:00.226 A:middle
[applause] It's pretty cool.
