00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.256 A:middle
best place for you to be

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:03.216 A:middle
rewarded for your hard work and

00:07:03.216 --> 00:07:04.236 A:middle
creativity.

00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:07.106 A:middle
Now at Apple, we know that

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:09.016 A:middle
developers are a powerful group

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:11.336 A:middle
of creators, that they can

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:14.386 A:middle
achieve and they can develop

00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:15.836 A:middle
anything that they can imagine

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:16.686 A:middle
with their code.

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.876 A:middle
We want more people to learn the

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:22.676 A:middle
power of code, and it all starts

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:24.486 A:middle
with Swift and Swift

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.306 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:07:25.996 --> 00:07:27.566 A:middle
We created Swift to make it

00:07:27.566 --> 00:07:29.746 A:middle
easy, to make it so easy to

00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:32.256 A:middle
learn to code that it was as

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:34.906 A:middle
easy as our products are to use.

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:37.346 A:middle
Swift is extremely popular.

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:39.006 A:middle
In fact, it's the fastest

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.146 A:middle
growing programming language out

00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:41.436 A:middle
there.

00:07:42.346 --> 00:07:44.266 A:middle
Now Apple developers are already

00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:45.986 A:middle
using it in huge numbers.

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:51.286 A:middle
In fact, over 350,000 apps have

00:07:51.286 --> 00:07:58.976 A:middle
been written in Swift on the App

00:07:58.976 --> 00:07:59.136 A:middle
Store.

00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.006 A:middle
Now [applause] we believe that
