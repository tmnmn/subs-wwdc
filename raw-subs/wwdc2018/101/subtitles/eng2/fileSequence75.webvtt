01:14:59.556 --> 01:15:00.506 A:middle
right in place inside

01:15:00.506 --> 01:15:01.366 A:middle
Notifications.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:04.006 A:middle
We've also improved our Message

01:15:04.006 --> 01:15:04.716 A:middle
notification.

01:15:05.216 --> 01:15:06.206 A:middle
Today if someone sends you a

01:15:06.206 --> 01:15:07.836 A:middle
weblink, you aren't able to view

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:08.396 A:middle
it on your list.

01:15:08.976 --> 01:15:11.126 A:middle
With watchOS 5, we've integrated

01:15:11.126 --> 01:15:12.266 A:middle
WebKit, so now you have the

01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:14.106 A:middle
ability to view web content and

01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:15.196 A:middle
mail or messages.

01:15:16.376 --> 01:15:17.596 A:middle
You can even tap on that link,

01:15:18.246 --> 01:15:20.356 A:middle
yes, to easily view things like

01:15:20.576 --> 01:15:21.296 A:middle
menus here.

01:15:21.366 --> 01:15:23.566 A:middle
And while we think full browsing

01:15:23.566 --> 01:15:24.406 A:middle
doesn't make sense on your

01:15:24.406 --> 01:15:25.726 A:middle
wrist, there are times you get

01:15:25.776 --> 01:15:26.146 A:middle
content.

01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:27.036 A:middle
You'd like to see it right in

01:15:27.036 --> 01:15:28.246 A:middle
the moment, and now you'll be

01:15:28.246 --> 01:15:29.706 A:middle
able to do that and watch OS 5.

01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:30.756 A:middle
And the contents can be

01:15:30.756 --> 01:15:32.156 A:middle
formatted for the small screen,

01:15:32.156 --> 01:15:33.236 A:middle
and the where reader made is

01:15:33.236 --> 01:15:34.316 A:middle
available, it uses that on the

01:15:34.316 --> 01:15:34.806 A:middle
watch.

01:15:35.096 --> 01:15:36.756 A:middle
So WebKit on watchOS.

01:15:37.516 --> 01:15:43.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:15:44.046 --> 01:15:45.086 A:middle
Now with watchOS 4, we

01:15:45.086 --> 01:15:46.546 A:middle
introduced an entirely new way

01:15:46.546 --> 01:15:47.656 A:middle
to listen to music while you're

01:15:47.656 --> 01:15:48.456 A:middle
on the go.

01:15:48.456 --> 01:15:50.096 A:middle
You can stream 48 million songs

01:15:50.096 --> 01:15:51.076 A:middle
on your wrist with Apple, or you

01:15:51.076 --> 01:15:52.666 A:middle
can listen to automatically

01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:54.266 A:middle
synced and created play lists.

01:15:54.656 --> 01:15:56.976 A:middle
And now with watchOS 5, we're

01:15:56.976 --> 01:15:57.916 A:middle
giving you even more to listen

01:15:57.916 --> 01:15:57.983 A:middle
to.
