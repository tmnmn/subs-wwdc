motivate all at the same time.

01:17:00.506 --> 01:17:01.146 A:middle
Take it away, Jules.

01:17:01.836 --> 01:17:02.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Kevin.

01:17:02.646 --> 01:17:03.706 A:middle
I've got some great stuff to

01:17:03.706 --> 01:17:04.656 A:middle
show you that I think you're

01:17:04.656 --> 01:17:06.316 A:middle
really going to love, and the

01:17:06.316 --> 01:17:07.776 A:middle
bonus is, I get to work on

01:17:07.776 --> 01:17:09.936 A:middle
closing my rings while I do it.

01:17:09.936 --> 01:17:12.066 A:middle
So, first, I'm super excited to

01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:13.676 A:middle
show you how easy it is to start

01:17:13.676 --> 01:17:14.956 A:middle
a workout with GymKit.

01:17:14.956 --> 01:17:18.716 A:middle
I just tap to connect and accept

01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:20.296 A:middle
on the watch, and now I can

01:17:20.296 --> 01:17:22.646 A:middle
control and start the workout

01:17:22.646 --> 01:17:23.916 A:middle
right here from the console on

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:24.436 A:middle
the bike.

01:17:24.986 --> 01:17:26.846 A:middle
All of my data between the watch

01:17:26.906 --> 01:17:28.416 A:middle
and the bike is in sync, and all

01:17:28.416 --> 01:17:29.526 A:middle
of my workout metrics are

01:17:29.526 --> 01:17:29.986 A:middle
accurate.

01:17:30.906 --> 01:17:32.046 A:middle
Now, I wouldn't typically be

01:17:32.046 --> 01:17:33.286 A:middle
trying to demo things for you

01:17:33.286 --> 01:17:34.336 A:middle
and sneak in a workout at the

01:17:34.336 --> 01:17:35.916 A:middle
same time, but I want to show

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:37.426 A:middle
you activity competitions.

01:17:37.426 --> 01:17:39.536 A:middle
And to do that, I need to keep

01:17:39.536 --> 01:17:39.986 A:middle
moving.

01:17:40.296 --> 01:17:41.546 A:middle
This morning I got this

01:17:41.546 --> 01:17:44.586 A:middle
notification, and it says, your

01:17:44.586 --> 01:17:46.196 A:middle
competition with Jay is down to

01:17:46.196 --> 01:17:47.636 A:middle
the last day, and it's a close

01:17:47.636 --> 01:17:47.886 A:middle
one.

01:17:48.326 --> 01:17:49.336 A:middle
Have you got what it takes to

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:49.586 A:middle
win?

01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:51.306 A:middle
Have I got what it takes?

01:17:51.306 --> 01:17:51.976 A:middle
You bet I do.

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:55.656 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:17:56.156 --> 01:17:57.716 A:middle
But if I scroll down, I can see

01:17:57.716 --> 01:17:58.876 A:middle
that Jay has moved ahead of me

01:17:58.876 --> 01:18:00.016 A:middle
by a couple of points, and
