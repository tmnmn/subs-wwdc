00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:00.676 A:middle
It can just tap on this little

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:03.506 A:middle
3D control and jump right in and

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:04.266 A:middle
experience it.

00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:05.146 A:middle
You can see the amazing

00:21:05.146 --> 00:21:06.646 A:middle
animations that are possible,

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:07.856 A:middle
and of course it's fully

00:21:07.856 --> 00:21:08.556 A:middle
interactive.

00:21:09.246 --> 00:21:12.296 A:middle
So I can zoom in and pan.

00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:15.056 A:middle
Isn't that amazing?

00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:20.546 A:middle
[applause] Now USDZ is also

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:21.366 A:middle
great in the web.

00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:23.136 A:middle
So here I am at the Fender

00:21:23.136 --> 00:21:24.436 A:middle
website and actually let you

00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:25.816 A:middle
configure your guitar with the

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:27.146 A:middle
kind of finish and pickguard

00:21:27.146 --> 00:21:27.726 A:middle
that you want.

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.626 A:middle
So I can select a configuration

00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:31.396 A:middle
option here, and then I can see

00:21:31.396 --> 00:21:32.856 A:middle
the guitar I've configured.

00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:34.306 A:middle
So I'm just going to tap in.

00:21:34.306 --> 00:21:36.186 A:middle
Of course I can see the guitar

00:21:36.256 --> 00:21:37.846 A:middle
here, but wouldn't it be cool if

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:39.426 A:middle
I could see it in the real world

00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:40.686 A:middle
in its real size?

00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:42.396 A:middle
Well, there it is.

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:42.636 A:middle
Check that out.

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:43.106 A:middle
[applause] I think I'm going to

00:21:43.956 --> 00:21:50.306 A:middle
capture that for posterity.

00:21:51.696 --> 00:21:53.726 A:middle
And that's a quick look at USDZ

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:56.806 A:middle
and Measure in iOS 12.

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.026 A:middle
Next-- thank you.
