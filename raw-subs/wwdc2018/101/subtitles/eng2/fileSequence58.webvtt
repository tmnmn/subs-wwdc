00:57:58.826 --> 00:58:00.206 A:middle
so many of us connect with the

00:58:00.256 --> 00:58:01.786 A:middle
people in our lives and share

00:58:01.786 --> 00:58:02.796 A:middle
some of our most important

00:58:02.796 --> 00:58:04.456 A:middle
moments, and it's helped us

00:58:04.556 --> 00:58:06.546 A:middle
deepen our connect with people

00:58:06.546 --> 00:58:08.216 A:middle
important to us wherever they

00:58:08.216 --> 00:58:10.116 A:middle
are, and of course it's a fun

00:58:10.116 --> 00:58:11.356 A:middle
place just to hang out.

00:58:11.916 --> 00:58:13.886 A:middle
Now this year Facetime is going

00:58:14.046 --> 00:58:16.226 A:middle
to take a big leap forward

00:58:16.786 --> 00:58:19.116 A:middle
because today we're introducing

00:58:19.956 --> 00:58:20.916 A:middle
Group Facetime.

00:58:22.516 --> 00:58:27.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:58:28.086 --> 00:58:30.496 A:middle
Now, you'll be able to facetime

00:58:31.106 --> 00:58:34.096 A:middle
with two people, three people,

00:58:34.986 --> 00:58:38.506 A:middle
actually up to 32 simultaneous

00:58:38.506 --> 00:58:38.976 A:middle
participants.

00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:42.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:58:43.466 --> 00:58:46.126 A:middle
Now, setting up a group call

00:58:46.186 --> 00:58:47.256 A:middle
couldn't be easier.

00:58:47.616 --> 00:58:48.616 A:middle
Just instead of typing one

00:58:48.616 --> 00:58:50.286 A:middle
person's name, you can do many.

00:58:50.286 --> 00:58:51.466 A:middle
You can ring them by tapping

00:58:51.546 --> 00:58:53.826 A:middle
audio or video, but we also

00:58:53.826 --> 00:58:55.156 A:middle
introduced a great new way

00:58:55.156 --> 00:58:56.426 A:middle
because Facetime is now

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:59.066 A:middle
integrated into messages, so you

00:58:59.066 --> 00:59:01.116 A:middle
can quickly go from a group chat
