00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
physical Lego sets brings great

00:24:01.216 --> 00:24:03.276 A:middle
joy to millions of children and

00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:05.436 A:middle
Lego fans all over the world.

00:24:06.186 --> 00:24:09.216 A:middle
And now, with ARKit 2, we get to

00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:10.396 A:middle
expand those creative

00:24:10.396 --> 00:24:12.336 A:middle
possibilities like never before

00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:14.856 A:middle
and take things beyond the

00:24:14.936 --> 00:24:15.386 A:middle
physical.

00:24:16.286 --> 00:24:18.946 A:middle
What we try to do is combine

00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:20.846 A:middle
physical and digital together to

00:24:20.846 --> 00:24:22.136 A:middle
really open up those creative

00:24:22.136 --> 00:24:24.016 A:middle
play possibilities, because our

00:24:24.016 --> 00:24:25.676 A:middle
Lego sets are really the start

00:24:25.676 --> 00:24:26.746 A:middle
point for all of those

00:24:26.746 --> 00:24:28.026 A:middle
children's imaginations.

00:24:28.026 --> 00:24:29.436 A:middle
And when we get a chance to

00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:32.946 A:middle
really imbed ARKit 2, it takes

00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:33.806 A:middle
it to the next level.

00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:35.166 A:middle
Let me show you what I mean.

00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:38.856 A:middle
Here we have Assembly Square.

00:24:38.906 --> 00:24:40.336 A:middle
It's one of our Lego creator

00:24:40.336 --> 00:24:42.496 A:middle
sets and already has so many

00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:44.036 A:middle
great details it's awesome to

00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:44.386 A:middle
play with.

00:24:44.386 --> 00:24:45.846 A:middle
But wouldn't it be great if we

00:24:45.846 --> 00:24:47.326 A:middle
could take things even further?

00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:49.916 A:middle
Well now with 3D object

00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:52.026 A:middle
detection, we get to recognize

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:53.836 A:middle
our models and bring them to

00:24:53.836 --> 00:24:53.976 A:middle
life.
