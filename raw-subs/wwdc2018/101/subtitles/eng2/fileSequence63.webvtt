IOS 12 looks fantastic, and we

01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:05.326 A:middle
can't wait for everyone to get

01:03:05.326 --> 01:03:06.756 A:middle
their hands on it.

01:03:07.056 --> 01:03:09.216 A:middle
Next up, we'd like to talk about

01:03:09.216 --> 01:03:10.736 A:middle
the Apple Watch.

01:03:10.736 --> 01:03:14.586 A:middle
Yeah. [applause] When we began

01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:15.866 A:middle
development of the watch many

01:03:15.866 --> 01:03:17.866 A:middle
years ago, we had a vision for

01:03:17.866 --> 01:03:20.216 A:middle
just how impactful and essential

01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:22.796 A:middle
it could become in our lives, so

01:03:22.796 --> 01:03:24.866 A:middle
we worked very hard to create

01:03:24.986 --> 01:03:26.916 A:middle
something that you would love

01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:28.696 A:middle
and want to wear all the time,

01:03:29.526 --> 01:03:31.776 A:middle
and customers do love it.

01:03:31.776 --> 01:03:33.636 A:middle
In fact, Apple Watch is number

01:03:33.636 --> 01:03:38.216 A:middle
one in customer satisfaction,

01:03:38.216 --> 01:03:39.216 A:middle
[applause] and not just this

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.066 A:middle
year, but every single year

01:03:41.066 --> 01:03:43.766 A:middle
since we launched in 2015.

01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:46.246 A:middle
And growth has been off the

01:03:46.246 --> 01:03:46.936 A:middle
charts.

01:03:47.796 --> 01:03:50.356 A:middle
Apple Watch grew 60 percent last

01:03:50.356 --> 01:03:50.686 A:middle
year.

01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:53.056 A:middle
We're constantly hearing from

01:03:53.056 --> 01:03:55.406 A:middle
customers about the many ways

01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:57.176 A:middle
that the Apple Watch has changed

01:03:57.176 --> 01:03:57.866 A:middle
their lives.

01:03:58.196 --> 01:04:00.646 A:middle
And I'd like to share just one
