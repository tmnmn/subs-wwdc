You can easily make or receive a

01:11:01.906 --> 01:11:03.226 A:middle
phone call, and you can hear the

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:04.756 A:middle
emotion and tone at the other

on your watch.

01:11:17.396 --> 01:11:18.976 A:middle
That's real-time voice but with

01:11:18.976 --> 01:11:20.246 A:middle
a spontaneity of short

01:11:20.246 --> 01:11:20.746 A:middle
messaging.

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:28.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Did you steal my chips?

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:30.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Maybe.
