00:18:59.836 --> 00:19:01.376 A:middle
and it's called Measure.

00:19:01.376 --> 00:19:03.516 A:middle
It makes it really easy to

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:05.226 A:middle
measure objects, detect

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:06.406 A:middle
rectangles and get their

00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:08.076 A:middle
dimensions, and measure lines

00:19:08.216 --> 00:19:09.896 A:middle
along surfaces, and I'd like to

00:19:09.896 --> 00:19:10.856 A:middle
show it to you now.

00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:15.176 A:middle
[applause] Now, in looking for

00:19:15.806 --> 00:19:18.356 A:middle
something to measure, I ended up

00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:21.186 A:middle
digging through the attic and

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.936 A:middle
came upon my old suitcase from

00:19:24.936 --> 00:19:27.296 A:middle
my traveling days in college.

00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:29.876 A:middle
A lot of memories in here.

00:19:30.326 --> 00:19:32.406 A:middle
Now I'm actually in the Measure

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:34.516 A:middle
app, and you see I can easily

00:19:34.516 --> 00:19:37.436 A:middle
measure along this suitcase by

00:19:37.436 --> 00:19:41.736 A:middle
just tapping and dragging out a

00:19:41.736 --> 00:19:44.166 A:middle
line, like that, and check that

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:44.866 A:middle
out.

00:19:45.016 --> 00:19:45.676 A:middle
It's a measurement.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.056 A:middle
[applause] Now, what's really

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:51.876 A:middle
cool is I can extend these

00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:54.486 A:middle
measurements so I can just tap,

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:57.166 A:middle
drag along another edge just

00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:59.956 A:middle
like that, and even take it into

00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:03.646 A:middle
full 3D by dragging down to the
