00:10:59.176 --> 00:11:00.516 A:middle
And of course we want to get

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:02.306 A:middle
these improvements to as many of

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:03.766 A:middle
our customers as possible.

00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:06.366 A:middle
IOS 11 supports devices that

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.856 A:middle
were introduced as far back as

00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:11.676 A:middle
2013, like the iPhone 5S.

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:13.566 A:middle
And we just love the way

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.916 A:middle
customers race to update to our

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:16.876 A:middle
newest releases.

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:19.136 A:middle
In fact, half of our customers

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:22.426 A:middle
upgraded to iOS 11 in just seven

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:22.686 A:middle
weeks.

00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:23.976 A:middle
It's incredible.

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:27.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:31.596 A:middle
Now as we stand here today, 81

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:33.756 A:middle
percent of our over a billion

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:35.706 A:middle
active iOS devices are running

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:36.896 A:middle
our latest release.

00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:39.406 A:middle
And now, when you look at the

00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:42.256 A:middle
competition, well it's hard to

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.566 A:middle
say they really have a software

00:11:43.566 --> 00:11:43.966 A:middle
update model.

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:48.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:51.496 A:middle
So iOS has the fastest adoption

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:52.906 A:middle
of any operating system, but

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:55.126 A:middle
what's much more important to us

00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:57.256 A:middle
is customer satisfaction, and

00:11:57.256 --> 00:11:58.696 A:middle
we're thrilled to report that

00:11:58.696 --> 00:12:01.786 A:middle
customer sat for iOS 11 is at 95
