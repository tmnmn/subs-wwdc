01:46:59.866 --> 01:47:01.866 A:middle
document, just like that.

01:47:02.676 --> 01:47:04.266 A:middle
Now, we've further enhanced the

01:47:04.266 --> 01:47:06.336 A:middle
way you capture content, and

01:47:06.446 --> 01:47:08.756 A:middle
that brings me to Continuity.

01:47:09.126 --> 01:47:11.086 A:middle
So Mac users love Continuity for

01:47:11.086 --> 01:47:12.436 A:middle
the way it lets us work across

01:47:12.436 --> 01:47:15.306 A:middle
our devices with things like Air

01:47:15.306 --> 01:47:16.866 A:middle
Drop or the ability to unlock

01:47:16.926 --> 01:47:19.146 A:middle
your Mac using your Apple Watch.

01:47:19.716 --> 01:47:20.876 A:middle
When it comes to capturing

01:47:20.876 --> 01:47:22.836 A:middle
content, we'll walk around with

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.206 A:middle
one of the best content capture

01:47:24.206 --> 01:47:25.456 A:middle
devices in the world in our

01:47:25.456 --> 01:47:27.056 A:middle
pockets, our phones.

01:47:27.666 --> 01:47:29.126 A:middle
And so we wanted to take

01:47:29.126 --> 01:47:30.806 A:middle
advantage of continuity to bring

01:47:30.806 --> 01:47:32.126 A:middle
that to the Mac with a feature

01:47:32.126 --> 01:47:34.216 A:middle
we call Continuity Camera.

01:47:34.216 --> 01:47:36.176 A:middle
Let me show you how it works.

01:47:37.756 --> 01:47:39.276 A:middle
So here in my Keynote

01:47:39.276 --> 01:47:41.426 A:middle
presentation, I have a space

01:47:41.426 --> 01:47:42.896 A:middle
that's just waiting for a new

01:47:42.976 --> 01:47:44.766 A:middle
photo, and on my phone right

01:47:44.846 --> 01:47:45.166 A:middle
here.

01:47:46.306 --> 01:47:47.846 A:middle
Well, when I select this object,

01:47:47.936 --> 01:47:50.666 A:middle
I can choose to take a photo.

01:47:50.666 --> 01:47:51.806 A:middle
And I want you to watch what

01:47:51.806 --> 01:47:53.026 A:middle
happens when I select this to my

01:47:53.096 --> 01:47:53.766 A:middle
phone.

01:47:54.066 --> 01:47:56.076 A:middle
It automatically immediately

01:47:56.076 --> 01:47:59.616 A:middle
lights up ready to take a photo.

01:47:59.716 --> 01:48:03.806 A:middle
So I can take one like this, and
