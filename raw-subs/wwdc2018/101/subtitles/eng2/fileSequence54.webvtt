00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:01.666 A:middle
And if I swipe right, here's

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:04.096 A:middle
where I can create my very own

00:54:04.096 --> 00:54:05.096 A:middle
Memoji.

00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:06.916 A:middle
Let me show you just how easy it

00:54:06.916 --> 00:54:07.756 A:middle
is.

00:54:08.096 --> 00:54:09.886 A:middle
I recently chopped my hair, so I

00:54:09.886 --> 00:54:11.406 A:middle
want one that matches the new

00:54:11.406 --> 00:54:12.156 A:middle
me.

00:54:12.656 --> 00:54:14.026 A:middle
So I've selected a skin color,

00:54:14.026 --> 00:54:16.036 A:middle
and now I'm trying to figure out

00:54:16.356 --> 00:54:17.836 A:middle
just the right amount of

00:54:17.836 --> 00:54:18.246 A:middle
freckles.

00:54:18.516 --> 00:54:20.836 A:middle
It's a real Goldilocks scenario.

00:54:22.106 --> 00:54:23.496 A:middle
Yeah, these are just right.

00:54:24.406 --> 00:54:27.156 A:middle
Okay. Onto the main event.

00:54:27.816 --> 00:54:29.726 A:middle
There are so many hairstyles to

00:54:29.726 --> 00:54:30.346 A:middle
choose from.

00:54:30.796 --> 00:54:31.926 A:middle
First, I'm going to grab my

00:54:31.926 --> 00:54:34.036 A:middle
color, and then like I said, I

00:54:34.036 --> 00:54:35.946 A:middle
need to go a little bit shorter.

00:54:36.556 --> 00:54:36.996 A:middle
All right.

00:54:37.776 --> 00:54:39.936 A:middle
Nope, this is the one.

00:54:41.126 --> 00:54:42.626 A:middle
Now that I'm all set, I can of

00:54:42.626 --> 00:54:44.606 A:middle
course select my eye color, and

00:54:44.606 --> 00:54:46.186 A:middle
what's really amazing is as I'm

00:54:46.186 --> 00:54:48.046 A:middle
making changes, the character up

00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:49.646 A:middle
above is coming to life.

00:54:51.516 --> 00:54:53.656 A:middle
There are tons of options for me

00:54:53.656 --> 00:54:54.226 A:middle
to customize.

00:54:54.276 --> 00:54:56.686 A:middle
I could add earrings, but what I

00:54:56.686 --> 00:54:58.676 A:middle
really want is a great pair of

00:54:58.676 --> 00:54:59.956 A:middle
Sunnies, so I'm going to come

00:54:59.956 --> 00:55:02.946 A:middle
over to eyewear and pick out
