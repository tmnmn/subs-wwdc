00:15:59.066 --> 00:16:00.926 A:middle
messages and mail, and what's

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.536 A:middle
great is you can place these 3D

00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:04.556 A:middle
objects into the real world.

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.856 A:middle
It's something that's like AR

00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:07.416 A:middle
quick look.

00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:08.856 A:middle
It's really awesome.

00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.816 A:middle
Now, we want all kinds of

00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:13.396 A:middle
creatives to be able to create

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:15.536 A:middle
content for AR, and so we're

00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:16.586 A:middle
working with the leading

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
companies for 3D tools and 3D

00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:22.266 A:middle
libraries to bring their support

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:22.806 A:middle
for USDZ.

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:26.146 A:middle
Now one company that's been all

00:16:26.146 --> 00:16:29.426 A:middle
in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe,

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:30.756 A:middle
and to tell you about what

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.996 A:middle
they're up to, I'd like to

00:16:31.996 --> 00:16:33.796 A:middle
invite Abhay Parasnis, their

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.776 A:middle
CTO, to the stage.

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:36.526 A:middle
Abhay.

00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:41.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Craig.

00:16:41.686 --> 00:16:44.596 A:middle
It's great to be here this morn.

00:16:45.816 --> 00:16:48.006 A:middle
So at Adobe we believe augmented

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:49.936 A:middle
reality is an incredibly

00:16:49.936 --> 00:16:50.836 A:middle
important technology.

00:16:52.046 --> 00:16:54.756 A:middle
And with ARKit, Apple is by far

00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:56.586 A:middle
the most powerful platform for

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:56.976 A:middle
AR.

00:16:58.336 --> 00:16:59.816 A:middle
So earlier Craig talked about

00:16:59.816 --> 00:17:00.686 A:middle
USDZ format.
