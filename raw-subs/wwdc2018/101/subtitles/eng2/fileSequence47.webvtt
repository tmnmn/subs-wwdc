[ Applause ]

00:47:01.396 --> 00:47:03.136 A:middle
Notifications are grouped not

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:05.696 A:middle
just by app but also by topic

00:47:05.696 --> 00:47:06.746 A:middle
and thread.

00:47:06.746 --> 00:47:08.146 A:middle
It gives you a great overview of

00:47:08.146 --> 00:47:09.026 A:middle
the notifications you've

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:09.516 A:middle
received.

00:47:10.006 --> 00:47:11.646 A:middle
You can tap in and look at a

00:47:11.646 --> 00:47:12.656 A:middle
particular group.

00:47:12.686 --> 00:47:14.496 A:middle
But of course just as important

00:47:15.106 --> 00:47:17.156 A:middle
with a single swipe, you can

00:47:17.156 --> 00:47:18.956 A:middle
triage a whole group of

00:47:18.956 --> 00:47:20.126 A:middle
notifications away.

00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:21.926 A:middle
So that's Notifications.

Now, in addition to these great

00:47:28.356 --> 00:47:30.196 A:middle
features for helping you limit

00:47:30.196 --> 00:47:32.366 A:middle
distractions, we wanted to go

00:47:32.476 --> 00:47:34.096 A:middle
further, and it's with a feature

00:47:34.096 --> 00:47:36.116 A:middle
we call screen time.

00:47:36.576 --> 00:47:39.106 A:middle
Screen time empowers you with

00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.386 A:middle
both insight and control over

00:47:41.386 --> 00:47:43.536 A:middle
how you spend your time, and it

00:47:43.536 --> 00:47:45.266 A:middle
starts with reports.

00:47:46.046 --> 00:47:48.036 A:middle
Every week, you get a weekly

00:47:48.036 --> 00:47:50.916 A:middle
activity summary that details

00:47:51.106 --> 00:47:53.346 A:middle
how you used your iPhone or

00:47:53.346 --> 00:47:53.636 A:middle
iPad.

00:47:54.536 --> 00:47:56.496 A:middle
You tap in, and you get to view

00:47:56.496 --> 00:47:58.236 A:middle
your full activity report.

00:47:58.946 --> 00:47:59.996 A:middle
It's really detailed.

00:47:59.996 --> 00:48:01.526 A:middle
You get deep insight on how much
