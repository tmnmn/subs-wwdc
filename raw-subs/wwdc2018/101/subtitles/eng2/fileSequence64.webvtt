01:03:58.196 --> 01:04:00.646 A:middle
And I'd like to share just one

01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:02.696 A:middle
of them with you this morning.

01:04:04.036 --> 01:04:06.696 A:middle
Mary Dovgen was boating with her

01:04:06.756 --> 01:04:08.956 A:middle
husband, John, when due to a

01:04:08.956 --> 01:04:11.406 A:middle
medical condition all of John's

01:04:11.406 --> 01:04:13.496 A:middle
muscles went completely limp,

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:15.536 A:middle
and he fell into the ice cold

01:04:15.536 --> 01:04:16.046 A:middle
water.

01:04:17.036 --> 01:04:18.546 A:middle
With her arms wrapped around

01:04:18.546 --> 01:04:21.086 A:middle
John to keep him from drowning,

01:04:21.236 --> 01:04:24.006 A:middle
Mary could not reach her phone

01:04:24.006 --> 01:04:25.846 A:middle
to call for help.

01:04:26.436 --> 01:04:28.696 A:middle
But with her Apple Watch, she

01:04:28.696 --> 01:04:31.306 A:middle
was able to call Siri, or to use

01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:34.666 A:middle
Siri to call 911, rescuers soon

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:36.936 A:middle
arrived, and saved John's live.

01:04:38.516 --> 01:04:42.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:45.426 A:middle
As Mary told us, if it wasn't

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:47.976 A:middle
for my Apple Watch, he really

01:04:47.976 --> 01:04:49.046 A:middle
would not be here today.

01:04:50.706 --> 01:04:52.176 A:middle
This is just one of the many

01:04:52.176 --> 01:04:53.726 A:middle
stories that we've heard about

01:04:53.726 --> 01:04:55.446 A:middle
about how Apple Watch is

01:04:55.446 --> 01:04:57.016 A:middle
impacting people's lives.

01:04:57.536 --> 01:04:59.416 A:middle
They range from getting people

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:01.026 A:middle
to be more active, to helping
