And remind you to call grandma

00:34:01.096 --> 00:34:01.656 A:middle
on her birthday.

00:34:01.656 --> 00:34:03.356 A:middle
Just tap, and it'll dial the

00:34:03.356 --> 00:34:04.096 A:middle
call for you.

00:34:04.846 --> 00:34:06.276 A:middle
Now, we think we're all going to

00:34:06.276 --> 00:34:08.206 A:middle
really enjoy using Shortcuts,

00:34:08.706 --> 00:34:10.266 A:middle
and so we went a step further.

00:34:10.366 --> 00:34:11.616 A:middle
We wanted to let you create your

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:15.226 A:middle
own shortcuts as users, multiple

00:34:15.266 --> 00:34:16.606 A:middle
steps across multiple

00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:18.755 A:middle
applications, and we're doing it

00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:21.956 A:middle
with a new Shortcuts app.

00:34:22.186 --> 00:34:23.706 A:middle
So with the Shortcuts app, you

00:34:23.706 --> 00:34:25.846 A:middle
could do something like create a

00:34:25.846 --> 00:34:28.016 A:middle
shortcut for surf time, and it

00:34:28.016 --> 00:34:29.076 A:middle
could go get you the surf

00:34:29.146 --> 00:34:30.936 A:middle
report, look up the current

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:33.085 A:middle
weather, get you the ETA to the

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.416 A:middle
beach, and even create a

00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:35.735 A:middle
reminder for you to put on

00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:37.496 A:middle
sunscreen when you get there.

00:34:37.806 --> 00:34:40.505 A:middle
Now, it's all done with simple

00:34:40.565 --> 00:34:43.025 A:middle
drag and drop steps in the

00:34:43.025 --> 00:34:45.416 A:middle
Shortcuts editor right here.

00:34:45.766 --> 00:34:47.106 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:48.466 A:middle
Now to show you how Shortcuts

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:50.076 A:middle
can streamline your day, I'd

00:34:50.076 --> 00:34:50.886 A:middle
like to invite one of our

00:34:50.886 --> 00:34:52.936 A:middle
leaders from our Siri Shortcuts

00:34:52.936 --> 00:34:55.085 A:middle
project, Kim Beverette

00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:56.126 A:middle
[phonetic], to the stage to give

00:34:56.126 --> 00:34:56.996 A:middle
you a live demo.

00:34:57.216 --> 00:34:57.566 A:middle
Kim.

00:34:57.566 --> 00:34:57.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey!

00:34:58.516 --> 00:35:05.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]
