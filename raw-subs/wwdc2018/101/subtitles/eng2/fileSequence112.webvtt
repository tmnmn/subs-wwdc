and reminders, but now in

01:52:00.816 --> 01:52:02.896 A:middle
Mojave, we're extending these

01:52:02.896 --> 01:52:05.026 A:middle
protections to include your

01:52:05.026 --> 01:52:07.856 A:middle
camera and your microphone as

01:52:07.856 --> 01:52:09.186 A:middle
well as protecting sensitive

01:52:09.186 --> 01:52:10.786 A:middle
parts of your file system, like

01:52:10.786 --> 01:52:12.536 A:middle
your mail database, your message

01:52:12.536 --> 01:52:14.426 A:middle
history, and your backups.

01:52:14.916 --> 01:52:16.786 A:middle
And all of this is protected by

01:52:16.786 --> 01:52:19.236 A:middle
default for any app that you run

01:52:19.236 --> 01:52:20.226 A:middle
on the system, an important

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:20.926 A:middle
protection.

01:52:22.516 --> 01:52:26.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:52:27.116 --> 01:52:28.106 A:middle
Next, I want to turn to some

01:52:28.106 --> 01:52:30.006 A:middle
great enhancements to Safari.

01:52:30.406 --> 01:52:31.756 A:middle
Safari works really hard to

01:52:32.296 --> 01:52:33.856 A:middle
protect your privacy, and this

01:52:33.856 --> 01:52:35.736 A:middle
year it's working even harder.

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:37.856 A:middle
Last year, we introduced

01:52:37.856 --> 01:52:39.556 A:middle
intelligent tracking prevention

01:52:39.916 --> 01:52:41.546 A:middle
to dramatically reduce the

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:43.456 A:middle
ability for apps to track you

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.486 A:middle
across websites using cookies.

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.566 A:middle
This is the kind of thing where

01:52:47.566 --> 01:52:48.946 A:middle
you look at a product on one

01:52:48.946 --> 01:52:49.306 A:middle
site.

01:52:49.656 --> 01:52:51.106 A:middle
Then you move to another site

01:52:51.376 --> 01:52:53.096 A:middle
and another site and somehow

01:52:53.096 --> 01:52:54.156 A:middle
this is just following you

01:52:54.156 --> 01:52:55.286 A:middle
wherever you go.

01:52:56.206 --> 01:52:58.116 A:middle
Well, we've all seen these,

01:52:58.166 --> 01:53:00.486 A:middle
these like buttons and share
