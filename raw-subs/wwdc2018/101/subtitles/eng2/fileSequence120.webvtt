01:59:59.556 --> 02:00:01.776 A:middle
for the first time on mobile.

02:00:02.666 --> 02:00:04.286 A:middle
But Metal also enables these

02:00:04.286 --> 02:00:06.756 A:middle
games to scale to take full

02:00:06.756 --> 02:00:08.726 A:middle
advantage of modern Macs.

02:00:09.386 --> 02:00:11.396 A:middle
In fact, across iOS and the Mac,

02:00:11.546 --> 02:00:13.346 A:middle
there are over one billion

02:00:13.446 --> 02:00:16.606 A:middle
Metal-enabled devices, and we're

02:00:16.606 --> 02:00:18.196 A:middle
constantly making Metal better.

02:00:18.946 --> 02:00:20.806 A:middle
To bring the highest GPU

02:00:20.806 --> 02:00:22.376 A:middle
performance in reach of all

02:00:22.926 --> 02:00:24.086 A:middle
Macs, we've recently added

02:00:24.086 --> 02:00:27.156 A:middle
support for external GPUs, and

02:00:28.686 --> 02:00:30.416 A:middle
this is powered by Metal, and

02:00:30.416 --> 02:00:31.896 A:middle
the results are truly mind

02:00:31.896 --> 02:00:32.396 A:middle
boggling.

02:00:32.886 --> 02:00:35.116 A:middle
For instance, running a filter

02:00:35.116 --> 02:00:36.816 A:middle
in DaVinci Resolve, look at how

02:00:36.816 --> 02:00:38.896 A:middle
it scales on the incredibly fast

02:00:38.896 --> 02:00:41.796 A:middle
iMac Pro as you add up to four

02:00:41.796 --> 02:00:42.326 A:middle
eGPUs.

02:00:42.326 --> 02:00:45.056 A:middle
Now, the results are even more

02:00:45.056 --> 02:00:46.256 A:middle
staggering when you take a

02:00:46.356 --> 02:00:48.486 A:middle
13-inch MacBook Pro and add

02:00:48.486 --> 02:00:51.806 A:middle
eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5

02:00:51.806 --> 02:00:53.206 A:middle
times speedup.

02:00:53.206 --> 02:00:54.056 A:middle
It's pretty awesome.

02:00:55.376 --> 02:00:57.606 A:middle
Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to

02:00:57.606 --> 02:00:58.956 A:middle
achieve all-new levels of

02:00:58.956 --> 02:01:00.886 A:middle
performance and realism in 3D
