00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:01.466 A:middle
resources all in French as

00:19:01.466 --> 00:19:02.806 A:middle
easily as I would've done with

00:19:02.806 --> 00:19:04.406 A:middle
just the string resources in

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:05.246 A:middle
Xcode 9.

00:19:05.576 --> 00:19:07.126 A:middle
So with that, let's go back to

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.876 A:middle
the slides and wrap up our

00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:11.366 A:middle
discussion of Xcode Localization

00:19:11.366 --> 00:19:11.836 A:middle
Catalog.

00:19:12.516 --> 00:19:19.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.906 A:middle
Alright, so we have introduced

00:19:21.906 --> 00:19:23.686 A:middle
the Xcode Localization Catalog

00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:26.346 A:middle
as Xcode's new standard for

00:19:26.346 --> 00:19:28.746 A:middle
localization export and import.

00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:31.286 A:middle
It provides more flexibility for

00:19:31.286 --> 00:19:33.146 A:middle
your translators and allows you

00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:34.676 A:middle
to conveniently provide more

00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:37.036 A:middle
visual and functional context to

00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:38.326 A:middle
better help them generate

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:40.346 A:middle
high-quality translations the

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:41.316 A:middle
first time.

00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:44.366 A:middle
It has increased file type

00:19:44.406 --> 00:19:45.926 A:middle
support, so you can export and

00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:47.876 A:middle
import your non-string resources

00:19:48.206 --> 00:19:49.696 A:middle
as easily as you've been doing

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:50.566 A:middle
with your string based

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:51.216 A:middle
resources.

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:54.766 A:middle
We've also updated Xcode build

00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:56.796 A:middle
to use the Xcode Localization

00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:57.986 A:middle
Catalog for continuous

00:19:57.986 --> 00:19:59.076 A:middle
integration support.
