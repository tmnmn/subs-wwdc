00:14:58.886 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
strings, my localizable.strings

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:02.356 A:middle
for the strings defined in code,

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:05.246 A:middle
my localizable stringsdict and

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:06.546 A:middle
the English version of the

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:06.976 A:middle
image.

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:09.806 A:middle
So the last part of Xcode

00:15:09.806 --> 00:15:11.556 A:middle
Localization Catalog is the

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:12.366 A:middle
Notes folder.

00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:14.486 A:middle
And Xcode doesn't put anything

00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:17.906 A:middle
in here, but yesterday, I ran my

00:15:17.906 --> 00:15:20.106 A:middle
XCUI tests, which are a really

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.556 A:middle
easy way to create screenshots.

00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:26.086 A:middle
And all my screenshots are saved

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:28.196 A:middle
as attachments to my test.

00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:29.606 A:middle
So we can go back and look at my

00:15:29.606 --> 00:15:32.236 A:middle
test results, see them.

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:35.756 A:middle
So for instance, I have my

00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.436 A:middle
splash screen added as an

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.386 A:middle
attachment here.

00:15:38.926 --> 00:15:40.866 A:middle
There we go.

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:42.976 A:middle
Alright, so I'm just going to

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:45.856 A:middle
pull these up in Finder and copy

00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:47.306 A:middle
them into the Notes folder.

00:15:47.426 --> 00:15:48.986 A:middle
So select Show in Finder.

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:52.266 A:middle
Alright, Show Package Contents,

00:15:52.526 --> 00:15:53.576 A:middle
look at Attachments.

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:55.146 A:middle
There they are.

00:15:56.556 --> 00:16:00.746 A:middle
Copy and Paste.
