00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.056 A:middle
your intent is the title and the

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:02.276 A:middle
description of the intent

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:02.886 A:middle
itself.

00:22:03.206 --> 00:22:05.836 A:middle
But most of what you're going to

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:07.656 A:middle
be localizing for your intent

00:22:07.656 --> 00:22:09.756 A:middle
definition are the shortcut

00:22:09.856 --> 00:22:13.036 A:middle
types that are composed together

00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:15.346 A:middle
from the intents parameters.

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:18.816 A:middle
And of course, when an intent is

00:22:18.816 --> 00:22:20.836 A:middle
invoked, it produces a response

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:22.846 A:middle
as well and these can also be

00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:25.676 A:middle
customized with Response

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:27.576 A:middle
Templates and these Response

00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:29.266 A:middle
Templates are localized in

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:31.076 A:middle
exactly the same way as your

00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:33.836 A:middle
shortcut types.

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:35.436 A:middle
Now let's take a deeper look at

00:22:35.436 --> 00:22:37.116 A:middle
the actual structure of an

00:22:37.116 --> 00:22:38.816 A:middle
intent and what's localizable

00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:39.196 A:middle
within it.

00:22:40.376 --> 00:22:42.426 A:middle
An intent is really a collection

00:22:42.426 --> 00:22:43.776 A:middle
of parameters that have a

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:45.136 A:middle
variety of types.

00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:46.866 A:middle
So they can have types like

00:22:47.106 --> 00:22:49.486 A:middle
integer or string and you saw

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:50.776 A:middle
yesterday that they also support

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:53.916 A:middle
custom objects and they support

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:55.776 A:middle
enumerations that are defined

00:22:55.776 --> 00:22:57.776 A:middle
right in your intent definition.

00:22:58.256 --> 00:23:02.036 A:middle
And these parameters are
