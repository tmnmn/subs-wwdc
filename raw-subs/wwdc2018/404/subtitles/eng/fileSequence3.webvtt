00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
For example, a storyboard file

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:02.956 A:middle
will be very helpful for your

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.416 A:middle
localizers to picture how your

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:06.356 A:middle
UI is laid out in your

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:07.496 A:middle
development language.

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:11.336 A:middle
It also does not provide with

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:13.176 A:middle
the custom metadata about the

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.956 A:middle
generated XLIFF.

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:16.826 A:middle
And finally, the XLIFF we

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.336 A:middle
generate today does not have

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:20.146 A:middle
size and length restrictions

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:21.836 A:middle
attributes and that might be

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:23.646 A:middle
very helpful for your localizers

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.586 A:middle
to know if a given string will

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:26.986 A:middle
be showing on a Watch screen or

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:28.636 A:middle
an iPhone screen or an iPad

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:30.156 A:middle
screen to make decisions about

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:31.596 A:middle
the length of the translation.

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.136 A:middle
So why is context important for

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:37.116 A:middle
your localizers?

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:40.226 A:middle
So if we take a look at this

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:43.026 A:middle
example from a travel app that

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.646 A:middle
we will be showing you later in

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:47.196 A:middle
our demo, so if you look at the

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.746 A:middle
string that says "Book" on the

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.366 A:middle
right corner of the Navigation

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.856 A:middle
bar, it's kind of clear to all

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:55.346 A:middle
of us here in the room that

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:56.626 A:middle
"book" refers to something

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:58.796 A:middle
related to travels because we

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.626 A:middle
have that visual context right
