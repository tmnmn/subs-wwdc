00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:00.086 A:middle
Localization Catalog on top of

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.106 A:middle
the XLIFF format.

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.416 A:middle
So if we take a look at our

00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:05.696 A:middle
example earlier, so all of our

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:07.206 A:middle
strings base localizable

00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:09.416 A:middle
resources will be extracted in

00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:11.726 A:middle
an XLIFF format and anything

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:13.406 A:middle
else that you have marked as

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:16.116 A:middle
localizable in your project will

00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:17.906 A:middle
be supported by the Localization

00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:21.006 A:middle
Catalog and exported in an xcloc

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:23.326 A:middle
along with the XLIFF files that

00:07:23.356 --> 00:07:24.336 A:middle
contains the strings.

00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:27.066 A:middle
So let's take a look closely at

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:29.176 A:middle
what is inside a Localization

00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:29.706 A:middle
Catalog.

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:33.156 A:middle
So inside your xcloc, you will

00:07:33.156 --> 00:07:36.536 A:middle
find a contents.json file, which

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:38.656 A:middle
contains metadata about the

00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:40.486 A:middle
exported Localization Catalog.

00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:43.286 A:middle
So it has information like the

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:45.106 A:middle
development language of your

00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:47.806 A:middle
application, the target language

00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:49.456 A:middle
of the exported Localization

00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:50.006 A:middle
Catalog.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:52.046 A:middle
It has information about the

00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:53.416 A:middle
tool that generated that

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:54.506 A:middle
Localization Catalog.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:55.846 A:middle
In this case, it's Xcode, so you

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:57.436 A:middle
will find information like the

00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:58.756 A:middle
version number and the build

00:07:58.756 --> 00:07:59.936 A:middle
number of Xcode.
