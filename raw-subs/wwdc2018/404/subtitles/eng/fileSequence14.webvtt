00:13:58.986 --> 00:14:01.166 A:middle
me and we can go into Finder and

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:03.006 A:middle
look at it.

00:14:03.236 --> 00:14:05.126 A:middle
Alright, here we go.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.556 A:middle
Here is my French Xcode

00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:09.206 A:middle
Localization Catalog with that

00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:10.596 A:middle
.xcloc extension.

00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:13.406 A:middle
And inside, as Sara said,

00:14:13.976 --> 00:14:15.886 A:middle
there's the contents.json with

00:14:15.886 --> 00:14:17.106 A:middle
metadata about my Xcode

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.196 A:middle
Localization Catalog.

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:20.496 A:middle
Next, we have Localized

00:14:20.576 --> 00:14:21.106 A:middle
Contents.

00:14:21.296 --> 00:14:23.866 A:middle
So in here, I have an XLIFF, the

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:25.936 A:middle
same as if I had used Xcode 9.

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:29.686 A:middle
You can see here it has all of

00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:33.556 A:middle
my strings and here we can see

00:14:33.556 --> 00:14:34.586 A:middle
highlighted in red the

00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:36.006 A:middle
untranslated copies of the

00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:36.646 A:middle
English.

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:39.926 A:middle
And also in Localized Contents

00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:42.436 A:middle
mimicking the file hierarchy of

00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:44.466 A:middle
my project, I have that logo

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:44.996 A:middle
image.

00:14:45.586 --> 00:14:47.856 A:middle
So next let's look at Source

00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:48.456 A:middle
Contents.

00:14:49.126 --> 00:14:50.836 A:middle
This likewise mimics the file

00:14:50.836 --> 00:14:52.676 A:middle
hierarchy of my Xcode project.

00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:55.666 A:middle
So I have my storyboards that

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:56.996 A:middle
are in base and I have the

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.716 A:middle
English for my info plist

00:14:58.886 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
strings, my localizable.strings
