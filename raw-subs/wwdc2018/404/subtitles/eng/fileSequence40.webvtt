00:39:58.076 --> 00:40:00.806 A:middle
So as you've seen, Xcode

00:40:00.806 --> 00:40:02.856 A:middle
Localization Catalogs are our

00:40:02.856 --> 00:40:04.246 A:middle
new standard in Xcode for

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:05.126 A:middle
localization.

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:08.806 A:middle
And these support all of the

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:11.686 A:middle
localizable resources in your

00:40:11.686 --> 00:40:13.946 A:middle
project, not just the strings

00:40:13.946 --> 00:40:14.966 A:middle
based resources.

00:40:15.376 --> 00:40:17.086 A:middle
And they also provide

00:40:17.316 --> 00:40:20.476 A:middle
flexibility to provide context

00:40:20.596 --> 00:40:22.186 A:middle
to localizers, whether that's

00:40:22.246 --> 00:40:23.596 A:middle
putting in screenshots from your

00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:26.036 A:middle
tests or putting in readme files

00:40:26.036 --> 00:40:27.646 A:middle
or movies of the use of your

00:40:27.646 --> 00:40:29.196 A:middle
application, you can give your

00:40:29.196 --> 00:40:30.986 A:middle
localizers the context that they

00:40:30.986 --> 00:40:33.796 A:middle
need to ensure you get exactly

00:40:33.796 --> 00:40:35.466 A:middle
the right translations the first

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:35.786 A:middle
time.

00:40:36.926 --> 00:40:39.176 A:middle
And you've also seen that Siri

00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:41.546 A:middle
Shortcuts are easy to localize

00:40:41.616 --> 00:40:42.956 A:middle
by localizing your intent

00:40:42.996 --> 00:40:46.126 A:middle
definition files, that these use

00:40:46.126 --> 00:40:48.766 A:middle
base localization with strings

00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:51.676 A:middle
files and that you can use

00:40:51.676 --> 00:40:52.936 A:middle
stringsdict files where

00:40:52.936 --> 00:40:54.476 A:middle
appropriate to handle things

00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:56.666 A:middle
like pluralization rules in a

00:40:56.666 --> 00:41:01.026 A:middle
variety of languages, and that
