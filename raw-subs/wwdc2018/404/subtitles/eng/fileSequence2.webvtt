00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:01.036 A:middle
are provided in the XLIFF files.

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:02.356 A:middle
So that is pretty

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.576 A:middle
straightforward process.

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:08.216 A:middle
Now, the XLIFF format provides a

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.856 A:middle
lot of benefits for you as a

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:10.536 A:middle
developer.

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.916 A:middle
First, it helps you to extract

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.726 A:middle
the localization work from your

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.396 A:middle
code so you don't have to make

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:18.266 A:middle
any language assumptions in your

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:18.886 A:middle
source code.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:21.776 A:middle
XLIFF files also holds the

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.896 A:middle
content to be localized from

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:25.736 A:middle
your development language along

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.306 A:middle
with the translations so your

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:28.696 A:middle
translators can do their work

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:31.096 A:middle
right in the XLIFF files that

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:32.006 A:middle
you have provided.

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.246 A:middle
In addition to that, instead of

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.096 A:middle
handing over multiple file types

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:38.736 A:middle
and keep track of them, XLIFF is

00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:40.406 A:middle
a really nice tool that

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.926 A:middle
consolidates strings from

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:43.556 A:middle
different resources and

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:45.186 A:middle
different file types into one

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:46.536 A:middle
single document.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:50.466 A:middle
But what XLIFF does not provide

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:52.126 A:middle
your localizers, it does not

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:53.846 A:middle
give them that visual and

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.046 A:middle
functional context.

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:57.806 A:middle
It does not provide the resource

00:02:57.806 --> 00:02:59.266 A:middle
data like assets in your

00:02:59.266 --> 00:02:59.786 A:middle
project.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:01.326 A:middle
For example, a storyboard file
