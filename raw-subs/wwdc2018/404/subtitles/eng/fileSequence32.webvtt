Alright, so once you go to Mars

00:32:05.656 --> 00:32:06.936 A:middle
once, you're probably going to

00:32:06.936 --> 00:32:08.656 A:middle
want to go again and again and

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:10.506 A:middle
again because those trips are

00:32:10.506 --> 00:32:11.636 A:middle
really cheap, as we saw.

00:32:12.716 --> 00:32:14.036 A:middle
And it would be nice if our app

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:16.086 A:middle
could suggest additional trips

00:32:16.206 --> 00:32:18.486 A:middle
to these frequent fliers and

00:32:18.486 --> 00:32:19.736 A:middle
give them a shortcut to book the

00:32:19.736 --> 00:32:20.596 A:middle
next vacation.

00:32:20.846 --> 00:32:22.706 A:middle
So with that in mind, I've added

00:32:22.706 --> 00:32:24.526 A:middle
an intent definition to our

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:25.036 A:middle
project.

00:32:25.146 --> 00:32:28.606 A:middle
Let's go look at it.

00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:30.136 A:middle
Okay, here's our intent

00:32:30.136 --> 00:32:30.756 A:middle
definition.

00:32:31.456 --> 00:32:33.136 A:middle
So we have a custom intent

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:35.946 A:middle
called "Book Item," has a title,

00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:40.026 A:middle
a description, and down here is

00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:41.566 A:middle
the actual suggestion.

00:32:42.106 --> 00:32:45.386 A:middle
So it is book a type for

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:46.756 A:middle
travelers, people.

00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:47.736 A:middle
Like Chris said, it's a

00:32:47.736 --> 00:32:49.436 A:middle
combination of parameters.

00:32:50.516 --> 00:32:52.836 A:middle
So we can see travelers is an

00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:57.406 A:middle
integer and type is defined in

00:32:57.406 --> 00:32:59.026 A:middle
this enum here, so we can see it

00:32:59.026 --> 00:33:01.376 A:middle
can be a flight, a cruise, a
