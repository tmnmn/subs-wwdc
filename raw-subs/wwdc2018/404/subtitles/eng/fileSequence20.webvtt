And if you have content out for

00:20:02.176 --> 00:20:04.256 A:middle
localization right now, don't

00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:05.736 A:middle
worry, you can still import

00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:07.026 A:middle
those XLIFFs when they come back

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:09.556 A:middle
to you both Xcode and Xcode

00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:11.256 A:middle
Build are backwards compatible.

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:14.606 A:middle
Alright, so with that, I'm going

00:20:14.606 --> 00:20:16.556 A:middle
to hand it over to Chris to talk

00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:18.756 A:middle
to you about localizing intent

00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:20.056 A:middle
definition files for the

00:20:20.056 --> 00:20:21.616 A:middle
creation of Siri Shortcuts.

00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:27.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:29.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Vivian.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:30.796 A:middle
Wow, that's really awesome.

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:32.306 A:middle
I'm really looking forward to

00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:33.146 A:middle
that trip to Mars.

00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:36.526 A:middle
So I'm going to be showing you

00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:38.656 A:middle
how to localize Siri Shortcuts

00:20:38.746 --> 00:20:40.476 A:middle
by localizing your intent

00:20:40.476 --> 00:20:41.306 A:middle
definitions.

00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:44.886 A:middle
And your intent definitions are

00:20:44.886 --> 00:20:46.546 A:middle
created in intent definition

00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:47.996 A:middle
files in Xcode.

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:50.146 A:middle
And these are what you use to

00:20:50.146 --> 00:20:51.876 A:middle
define your custom intents for

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:52.886 A:middle
Siri Shortcuts.

00:20:53.516 --> 00:20:54.916 A:middle
They're just files with an

00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:57.166 A:middle
intent definition extension that

00:20:57.166 --> 00:20:59.406 A:middle
have a custom editor in Xcode.
