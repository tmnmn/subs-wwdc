00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:05.136 A:middle
Well, Xcode is just going to

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:06.656 A:middle
generate in its strings file

00:25:07.786 --> 00:25:10.996 A:middle
"Book a expedition" which isn't

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:12.546 A:middle
really very grammatical.

00:25:13.516 --> 00:25:14.746 A:middle
Fortunately, though, these

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.266 A:middle
strings files are keyed by

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:19.956 A:middle
well-defined IDs and stable IDs

00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:21.926 A:middle
so you can just go into the

00:25:21.926 --> 00:25:24.996 A:middle
strings file and change it so

00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:26.466 A:middle
that it's properly grammatical.

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.586 A:middle
Now English isn't the only

00:25:29.586 --> 00:25:31.416 A:middle
language that has this kind of

00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:32.476 A:middle
grammatical agreement.

00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:34.396 A:middle
Different languages, of course,

00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:35.596 A:middle
have different grammatical

00:25:35.596 --> 00:25:36.036 A:middle
agreement.

00:25:36.276 --> 00:25:37.686 A:middle
So you'll need to do the same

00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:39.776 A:middle
kind of thing say in French,

00:25:40.176 --> 00:25:41.626 A:middle
where you'll need to make the

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:44.006 A:middle
gender of the article agree with

00:25:44.006 --> 00:25:45.846 A:middle
the gender of the noun that it's

00:25:45.846 --> 00:25:48.046 A:middle
referring to.

00:25:48.336 --> 00:25:50.486 A:middle
Now let's take a quick look at a

00:25:50.486 --> 00:25:51.856 A:middle
more complex example.

00:25:52.716 --> 00:25:55.816 A:middle
Here we have a shortcut type for

00:25:55.816 --> 00:25:57.736 A:middle
booking a vacation for some

00:25:57.736 --> 00:26:00.106 A:middle
number of people and once again,
