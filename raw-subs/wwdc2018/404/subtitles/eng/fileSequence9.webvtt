00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.336 A:middle
builder files, for example.

00:09:00.826 --> 00:09:05.206 A:middle
Next, inside the Localization

00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:07.176 A:middle
Catalog, we generate a Source

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.976 A:middle
Contents directory and this is

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:11.356 A:middle
mainly provided for context.

00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:14.336 A:middle
So Source Contents contains

00:09:14.606 --> 00:09:16.336 A:middle
assets that were used to produce

00:09:16.336 --> 00:09:18.056 A:middle
the Localized Contents like

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:19.576 A:middle
storyboards for example that

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:20.656 A:middle
will be helpful for your

00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:23.096 A:middle
localizers to see how your UI is

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.366 A:middle
laid out in your development

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:25.366 A:middle
language so they can make

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:27.486 A:middle
decisions about the length of

00:09:27.486 --> 00:09:28.416 A:middle
the translations.

00:09:29.366 --> 00:09:30.816 A:middle
So even if your localized

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.006 A:middle
strings are coming from your

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.166 A:middle
source code, we do not generate

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.086 A:middle
your source code inside the

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:37.086 A:middle
Source Contents.

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.676 A:middle
So those assets that are mainly

00:09:39.676 --> 00:09:41.686 A:middle
provided for context will be

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:43.546 A:middle
also organized into the same

00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:44.956 A:middle
file system hierarchy are your

00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:46.316 A:middle
Xcode project inside the

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:48.616 A:middle
Localization Catalog and, as I

00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:50.026 A:middle
mentioned, this is mainly

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:51.776 A:middle
provided for context even if

00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:53.566 A:middle
your localizers go and change

00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:55.956 A:middle
your source context on import,

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:58.026 A:middle
Xcode will just ignore them and

00:09:58.026 --> 00:10:00.246 A:middle
will not import these resources
