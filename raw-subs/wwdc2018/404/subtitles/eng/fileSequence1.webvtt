Finally, Chris will talk about

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.276 A:middle
how to localize Siri Shortcuts

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:03.906 A:middle
by using an Intent definition

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.936 A:middle
file which is a new file format

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:07.546 A:middle
we introduced this year as well

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:08.646 A:middle
in Xcode 10.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.536 A:middle
So let's get started with a

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.576 A:middle
quick overview.

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:17.666 A:middle
So before Xcode 10, if you had a

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:19.166 A:middle
project that contains

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.996 A:middle
localizations that your

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:22.676 A:middle
application supports, we look

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.276 A:middle
for strings base localizable

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:25.696 A:middle
resources in your project.

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:27.746 A:middle
So these strings can be defined

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:29.026 A:middle
in your source code, your

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:30.546 A:middle
storyboard files, your strings

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.606 A:middle
files, or your strings

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:32.186 A:middle
dictionaries.

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:34.466 A:middle
So once we identify these

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.426 A:middle
resources, we extract strings

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:38.786 A:middle
from them and we export them in

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:39.766 A:middle
an XLIFF format.

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:42.556 A:middle
So XLIFF is an industry standard

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.296 A:middle
and most localizers are already

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:45.056 A:middle
familiar with.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:46.536 A:middle
So that's what you will be

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:48.246 A:middle
sending over for translations.

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:51.546 A:middle
So once you get your XLIFF files

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:54.216 A:middle
back translated on imports, we

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:55.356 A:middle
add them to localizable

00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:57.596 A:middle
resources in your Xcode projects

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.346 A:middle
with the new translations that

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:01.036 A:middle
are provided in the XLIFF files.
