00:09:58.026 --> 00:10:00.246 A:middle
will not import these resources

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.936 A:middle
back into your projects.

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:05.726 A:middle
Finally, inside your

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:07.166 A:middle
Localization Catalog, you will

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.426 A:middle
find a Notes directory and this

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:11.646 A:middle
is mainly provided for you to

00:10:11.646 --> 00:10:13.766 A:middle
give any additional contextual

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.946 A:middle
information for your localizers.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.546 A:middle
That can be screenshots data

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:21.486 A:middle
from your UI Attachments for

00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:22.046 A:middle
example.

00:10:22.976 --> 00:10:25.176 A:middle
It can be a Readme file or a

00:10:25.176 --> 00:10:28.016 A:middle
movie that explains information

00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:30.276 A:middle
about your app or anything

00:10:30.276 --> 00:10:31.476 A:middle
really you think that will be

00:10:31.476 --> 00:10:34.026 A:middle
important for your localizers.

00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:35.476 A:middle
So that was the Xcode

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:37.286 A:middle
Localization Catalog structure.

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.026 A:middle
And we have been also working on

00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:42.156 A:middle
updating the Xcode build command

00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:42.836 A:middle
line tools.

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:45.196 A:middle
So now on exports, we generate

00:10:45.196 --> 00:10:46.966 A:middle
an Xcode Localization Catalog.

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:49.086 A:middle
And on imports, the imports

00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:51.406 A:middle
command is backwards compatible.

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.386 A:middle
So if you still have those old

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.626 A:middle
XLIFF files, you can still

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:55.946 A:middle
important them back into your

00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:58.226 A:middle
project or you can import back

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
the new Localization Catalog.
