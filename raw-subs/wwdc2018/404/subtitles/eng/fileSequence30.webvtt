00:29:58.246 --> 00:30:00.126 A:middle
enumerations that you've defined

00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:01.556 A:middle
in your intent definition when

00:30:01.556 --> 00:30:02.856 A:middle
it's generating the strings

00:30:02.856 --> 00:30:02.976 A:middle
files.

00:30:03.146 --> 00:30:08.106 A:middle
And you can use both strings and

00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.356 A:middle
stringsdict files to localize

00:30:10.356 --> 00:30:11.106 A:middle
your shortcuts.

00:30:11.586 --> 00:30:14.796 A:middle
And if you're creating an intent

00:30:14.886 --> 00:30:16.836 A:middle
in code to donate it to the

00:30:16.916 --> 00:30:18.716 A:middle
system, to inform the system of

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:19.986 A:middle
a user action that might be

00:30:19.986 --> 00:30:23.066 A:middle
repeated, you can use deferred

00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:26.616 A:middle
Localized Intents String to wrap

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:28.236 A:middle
that string in such a way that

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:29.476 A:middle
it'll be localized when it's

00:30:29.476 --> 00:30:31.526 A:middle
presented to the user, not at

00:30:31.526 --> 00:30:32.826 A:middle
the point where it's created in

00:30:32.826 --> 00:30:33.626 A:middle
your application.

00:30:33.626 --> 00:30:35.416 A:middle
So if the user changes their

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.546 A:middle
phone's language in between when

00:30:37.546 --> 00:30:39.196 A:middle
you've donated that intent, and

00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:40.996 A:middle
when a shortcut is displayed, it

00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:43.416 A:middle
still follows the user's phone

00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:43.976 A:middle
language.

00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:49.566 A:middle
Now when you define strings in a

00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:51.566 A:middle
stringsdict file, they are

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:53.146 A:middle
actually going to be preferred

00:30:53.146 --> 00:30:53.876 A:middle
at runtime.

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:56.046 A:middle
That means you can do the

00:30:56.046 --> 00:30:58.266 A:middle
majority of your localization in

00:30:58.266 --> 00:31:00.246 A:middle
your strings files for all of
