00:38:59.116 --> 00:39:00.566 A:middle
localization process where you

00:39:00.566 --> 00:39:02.186 A:middle
develop your apps sum, you get

00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:03.546 A:middle
that version localized, you make

00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:05.796 A:middle
some tweaks for version two, and

00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:07.136 A:middle
you don't lose anything when you

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:09.386 A:middle
export for another round of

00:39:09.386 --> 00:39:10.176 A:middle
localization.

00:39:10.706 --> 00:39:13.466 A:middle
And this works for the

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:15.066 A:middle
non-string resources as well.

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:16.926 A:middle
So this will have the French

00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:18.536 A:middle
version of my image.

00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:21.936 A:middle
Great. So I can develop my app,

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:24.236 A:middle
keep localizing, keep working

00:39:24.296 --> 00:39:26.236 A:middle
and it's all just as easy as the

00:39:26.236 --> 00:39:29.056 A:middle
first time and it covers both my

00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:30.426 A:middle
strings and my non-string

00:39:30.426 --> 00:39:31.876 A:middle
resources and my intent

00:39:31.876 --> 00:39:33.366 A:middle
definitions so that I can

00:39:33.426 --> 00:39:34.786 A:middle
suggest additional trips to

00:39:34.786 --> 00:39:35.176 A:middle
Mars.

00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:37.736 A:middle
Alright, so with that, I'm going

00:39:37.736 --> 00:39:38.806 A:middle
to turn it back over to Chris

00:39:38.806 --> 00:39:40.976 A:middle
for the last time to summarize.

00:39:41.516 --> 00:39:46.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:50.476 --> 00:39:52.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Vivian.

00:39:53.146 --> 00:39:54.066 A:middle
Wow, that's really great.

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:55.716 A:middle
I'm really looking forward to

00:39:55.716 --> 00:39:56.316 A:middle
those trips now.

00:39:58.076 --> 00:40:00.806 A:middle
So as you've seen, Xcode
