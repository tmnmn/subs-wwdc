00:25:57.736 --> 00:26:00.106 A:middle
number of people and once again,

00:26:00.246 --> 00:26:01.526 A:middle
when generating that strings

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.706 A:middle
file, Xcode, well, it's going to

00:26:03.706 --> 00:26:05.546 A:middle
combine together the template

00:26:06.246 --> 00:26:08.106 A:middle
with the values from the

00:26:08.106 --> 00:26:08.866 A:middle
enumeration.

00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:10.876 A:middle
However, it's not going to

00:26:10.876 --> 00:26:13.056 A:middle
generate one string for every

00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.016 A:middle
possible integer as well.

00:26:16.256 --> 00:26:18.716 A:middle
Instead, it's going to leave the

00:26:18.716 --> 00:26:20.066 A:middle
strings that it generates with a

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.756 A:middle
placeholder in them that the

00:26:21.756 --> 00:26:24.496 A:middle
shortcut system will replace at

00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:24.866 A:middle
runtime.

00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:29.446 A:middle
And once again, this looks like

00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:30.376 A:middle
it should be reasonable.

00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:32.986 A:middle
Right? it says, you know, book a

00:26:32.986 --> 00:26:35.536 A:middle
vacation or book a flight for

00:26:35.656 --> 00:26:36.566 A:middle
some number of people.

00:26:37.066 --> 00:26:41.076 A:middle
And in our strings file, we get

00:26:41.076 --> 00:26:42.716 A:middle
that generated ID and that

00:26:42.716 --> 00:26:44.226 A:middle
string that says, oh, book a

00:26:44.226 --> 00:26:46.376 A:middle
cruise for some number of people

00:26:46.606 --> 00:26:48.666 A:middle
with that placeholder still in

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:51.526 A:middle
there; however, when I go to

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:53.796 A:middle
book a cruise for just myself to

00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:57.386 A:middle
celebrate a great WWDC, what's

00:26:57.386 --> 00:26:59.206 A:middle
going to be shown as an actual

00:26:59.206 --> 00:27:01.666 A:middle
shortcut is the string "Book a
