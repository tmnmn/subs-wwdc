variety of languages, and that

00:41:01.026 --> 00:41:02.796 A:middle
when you're creating an intent

00:41:02.906 --> 00:41:05.236 A:middle
to donate in code, you can use

00:41:05.286 --> 00:41:06.926 A:middle
deferred localized intent

00:41:06.926 --> 00:41:09.116 A:middle
strings to ensure that a

00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:10.986 A:middle
shortcut that's created from

00:41:10.986 --> 00:41:13.986 A:middle
that donated intent is localized

00:41:13.986 --> 00:41:15.506 A:middle
at the time that it's displayed

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.196 A:middle
to the user, rather than at the

00:41:17.196 --> 00:41:18.966 A:middle
point where you donated it.

00:41:19.496 --> 00:41:21.766 A:middle
For more information, you can

see our session page on the WWDC

00:41:23.936 --> 00:41:24.646 A:middle
website.

00:41:26.476 --> 00:41:28.166 A:middle
Thank you again so much for

00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:29.796 A:middle
coming and I hope you continue

00:41:29.796 --> 00:41:31.966 A:middle
to have a great WWDC.
