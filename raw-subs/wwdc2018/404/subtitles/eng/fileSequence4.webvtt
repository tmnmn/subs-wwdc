00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.626 A:middle
have that visual context right

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:02.106 A:middle
in front of us that says start

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.026 A:middle
day and dates, number of

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:05.666 A:middle
travelers and the price.

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:08.726 A:middle
But if you send your translators

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:11.136 A:middle
an XLIFF files, the only thing

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.616 A:middle
they see there is just the

00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:14.196 A:middle
string "Book" and that don't

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.046 A:middle
have that visual context that we

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:17.526 A:middle
were looking at earlier.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:20.666 A:middle
So Book can refer to two

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:21.356 A:middle
different things.

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.936 A:middle
It can be a noun in the context

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:26.726 A:middle
of reading a book or it can be a

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:28.966 A:middle
verb in the context of booking a

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.586 A:middle
hotel room somewhere or a flight

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.246 A:middle
ticket or travel in general.

00:04:33.846 --> 00:04:35.446 A:middle
I actually asked our Russian

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:36.936 A:middle
translator if he can translate

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:38.386 A:middle
the word "book" for me without

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:39.936 A:middle
giving him any additional

00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:42.176 A:middle
context and he came up with all

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:43.426 A:middle
these different options.

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:45.756 A:middle
So without giving him that extra

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:47.186 A:middle
context, it would be very

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.756 A:middle
difficult for him to decide

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:50.586 A:middle
which string to show in the UI

00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:52.266 A:middle
for Russian users, for example.

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:55.266 A:middle
Context can also be important

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:57.166 A:middle
for your localizers to decide

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.156 A:middle
about the length of the

00:04:58.156 --> 00:04:58.976 A:middle
translations they are using.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:02.436 A:middle
So if we take a look at this
