00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.216 A:middle
our session.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.446 A:middle
My name is Sara Radi.

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:31.636 A:middle
I'm a software engineer in the

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.576 A:middle
Localization Team at Apple and

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:34.746 A:middle
today we'll be joined by my

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.526 A:middle

talk about new location

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.646 A:middle

Localization Catalog, which is

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.786 A:middle
the new format for exports and

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:56.706 A:middle
imports in your localizations in

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:57.556 A:middle
Xcode 10.

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.026 A:middle
