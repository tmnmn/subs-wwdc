00:17:58.636 --> 00:18:00.696 A:middle
French and the application

00:18:00.696 --> 00:18:02.106 A:middle
region to France.

00:18:02.756 --> 00:18:04.506 A:middle
Now I'm ready to run.

00:18:05.516 --> 00:18:06.836 A:middle
We're going to stop the English

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:07.646 A:middle
from running.

00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:11.216 A:middle
Okay? So in just a moment here,

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.796 A:middle
we should get our app entirely

00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:13.456 A:middle
in French.

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:16.566 A:middle
Okay, looks good so far.

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:17.316 A:middle
I'm just going to go through

00:18:17.316 --> 00:18:18.376 A:middle
really fast so I can go check on

00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:19.126 A:middle
that Book button.

00:18:20.156 --> 00:18:21.796 A:middle
Alright, Browse, let's go to

00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:22.636 A:middle
Mars again.

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:24.166 A:middle
I really like Gale Creator.

00:18:24.746 --> 00:18:25.626 A:middle
Okay, great.

00:18:26.056 --> 00:18:27.426 A:middle
That Book button was translated

00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:27.866 A:middle
correctly.

00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:28.996 A:middle
It was probably really helpful

00:18:28.996 --> 00:18:30.746 A:middle
that I included screenshot of

00:18:30.746 --> 00:18:31.306 A:middle
this part.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.886 A:middle
If we check on the dates here,

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:36.396 A:middle
alright, I did not have to send

00:18:36.396 --> 00:18:37.806 A:middle
a list of months to my

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:38.616 A:middle
translators.

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:40.976 A:middle
Instead, I used this nice date

00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.426 A:middle
picker that in turn uses a

00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:43.986 A:middle
formatter and I got these

00:18:43.986 --> 00:18:45.436 A:middle
localizations for free.

00:18:46.816 --> 00:18:48.376 A:middle
And likewise, by using a

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:50.236 A:middle
formatter for the price, I got

00:18:50.266 --> 00:18:51.596 A:middle
the correct number formatting

00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:53.116 A:middle
and the price given in Euros.

00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:56.676 A:middle
Alright, so that was super easy

00:18:56.876 --> 00:18:58.886 A:middle
to get my strings and non-string

00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:01.466 A:middle
resources all in French as
