00:34:00.106 --> 00:34:01.086 A:middle
And here we go.

00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:03.496 A:middle
Alright, and you can see as I

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:06.426 A:middle
scroll through, it has every

00:34:06.426 --> 00:34:08.516 A:middle
possible string given the

00:34:08.516 --> 00:34:09.916 A:middle
possible values for the

00:34:09.916 --> 00:34:12.156 A:middle
parameters defined in enums.

00:34:13.045 --> 00:34:14.556 A:middle
This is great because, again, I

00:34:14.556 --> 00:34:16.456 A:middle
don't speak French but I know

00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:18.386 A:middle
from the slides that flight and

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.416 A:middle
cruise have different

00:34:19.416 --> 00:34:20.735 A:middle
grammatical gender, they're

00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:22.045 A:middle
going to need different forms of

00:34:22.045 --> 00:34:25.096 A:middle
the word for "a."

00:34:25.356 --> 00:34:27.306 A:middle
Alright, but there's still some

00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:29.686 A:middle
grammar problems I can fix and

00:34:29.686 --> 00:34:30.916 A:middle
those are the ones in English,

00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:34.926 A:middle
the case of one person and an

00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:36.106 A:middle
expedition.

00:34:36.585 --> 00:34:38.436 A:middle
So to do that, I need, or at

00:34:38.436 --> 00:34:40.275 A:middle
least to fix the plural case,

00:34:40.676 --> 00:34:41.946 A:middle
I'm going to add a stringsdict

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:44.146 A:middle
file with the same name as my

00:34:44.146 --> 00:34:45.216 A:middle
intent definition.

00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:47.656 A:middle
So just go over here to my

00:34:47.656 --> 00:34:48.186 A:middle
project.

00:34:48.676 --> 00:34:49.936 A:middle
Create new file.

00:34:51.146 --> 00:34:52.366 A:middle
And I'm going to use the

00:34:52.366 --> 00:34:53.896 A:middle
stringsdict template that was

00:34:54.045 --> 00:34:55.116 A:middle
added in Xcode 9.

00:34:56.696 --> 00:34:57.406 A:middle
Click Next.

00:34:58.516 --> 00:34:59.536 A:middle
Alright, here's the important

00:34:59.536 --> 00:34:59.746 A:middle
part.

00:34:59.746 --> 00:35:00.576 A:middle
I need to make sure I get the
