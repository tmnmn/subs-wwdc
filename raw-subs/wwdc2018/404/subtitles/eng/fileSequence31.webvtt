00:30:58.266 --> 00:31:00.246 A:middle
your strings files for all of

00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:01.636 A:middle
the cases where you don't need

00:31:01.636 --> 00:31:04.506 A:middle
things like plural agreement and

00:31:04.506 --> 00:31:06.416 A:middle
then you can just provide a

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:08.336 A:middle
strings file or a stringsdict

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:10.666 A:middle
file with the same name as your

00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.876 A:middle
intent definition as an

00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:13.656 A:middle
override.

00:31:14.276 --> 00:31:16.996 A:middle
And when you create that

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:18.956 A:middle
stringsdict file, you can use

00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:21.966 A:middle
either the strings themselves or

00:31:21.966 --> 00:31:23.836 A:middle
the strings IDs that Xcode

00:31:23.836 --> 00:31:26.296 A:middle
assigns as keys in your strings

00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:29.276 A:middle
file as the Localized String Key

00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.936 A:middle
and string somewhat measure of

00:31:31.036 --> 00:31:32.456 A:middle
stability in case you actually

00:31:32.456 --> 00:31:34.556 A:middle
decide to change things in your

00:31:34.556 --> 00:31:35.536 A:middle
intent definition.

00:31:36.056 --> 00:31:39.926 A:middle
So now, I'd like to bring Vivian

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.896 A:middle
back up to show you exactly how

00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:43.126 A:middle
to do this, how this whole

00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:44.976 A:middle
process works in Xcode.

00:31:45.516 --> 00:31:50.846 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:51.346 --> 00:31:51.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chris.
