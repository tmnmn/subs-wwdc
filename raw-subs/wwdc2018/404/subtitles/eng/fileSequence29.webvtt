00:28:58.076 --> 00:29:00.136 A:middle
That can be displayed far off at

00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:01.576 A:middle
some point in the future based

00:29:01.576 --> 00:29:02.776 A:middle
on the user's actions.

00:29:04.246 --> 00:29:07.106 A:middle
So we have a new API that

00:29:07.106 --> 00:29:09.316 A:middle
creates a deferred localizable

00:29:09.316 --> 00:29:12.516 A:middle
string that will be localized at

00:29:12.516 --> 00:29:13.946 A:middle
the point where the string is

00:29:13.946 --> 00:29:15.306 A:middle
presented to the user.

00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:19.376 A:middle
And this is necessary because

00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:21.226 A:middle
donating an intent to the system

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.136 A:middle
is really telling the system,

00:29:23.216 --> 00:29:25.026 A:middle
hey, the user performed some

00:29:25.026 --> 00:29:27.696 A:middle
action in my application that

00:29:27.696 --> 00:29:29.886 A:middle
you might want to offer them

00:29:29.886 --> 00:29:31.896 A:middle
again at some other point.

00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:35.506 A:middle
And, fortunately, this API is

00:29:35.506 --> 00:29:37.346 A:middle
extremely simple to use.

00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:39.976 A:middle
It's just one call added to NS

00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:42.396 A:middle
String that you can use to wrap

00:29:42.436 --> 00:29:43.776 A:middle
the string that you're going to

00:29:43.776 --> 00:29:45.856 A:middle
assign to that intent you

00:29:45.856 --> 00:29:49.366 A:middle
created in code.

00:29:50.056 --> 00:29:52.786 A:middle
So let's talk quickly about what

00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:53.376 A:middle
we've seen.

00:29:54.146 --> 00:29:56.216 A:middle
We've seen that Xcode combines

00:29:56.216 --> 00:29:58.076 A:middle
your shortcut types with the

00:29:58.246 --> 00:30:00.126 A:middle
enumerations that you've defined
