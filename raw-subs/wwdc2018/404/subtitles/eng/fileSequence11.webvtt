00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
the new Localization Catalog.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.126 A:middle
And with that, I would like to

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:04.736 A:middle
hand it over to Vivian to give

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:06.046 A:middle
you a demonstration about the

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:07.126 A:middle
Localization Catalog.

00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:07.886 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:11:08.516 --> 00:11:12.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:13.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sara.

00:11:19.036 --> 00:11:20.776 A:middle
Alright, so we've been working

00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:23.226 A:middle
on a travel app and what makes

00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:25.246 A:middle
this special is it's the first

00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:27.506 A:middle
app to let you plan vacations to

00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:28.256 A:middle
other planets.

00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:30.256 A:middle
So we call it Vacation Planet.

00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:31.156 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:33.966 A:middle
Alright, so on the splash screen

00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:35.626 A:middle
we have this lovely logo with

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:37.706 A:middle
the name of our app.

00:11:37.706 --> 00:11:38.576 A:middle
And I'm just going to click

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:38.996 A:middle
Browse here.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.146 A:middle
Alright, so we can book a

00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:43.816 A:middle
flight, an expedition, a cruise,

00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:45.546 A:middle
or an entire vacation package.

00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:46.806 A:middle
Let's go to Mars.

00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:50.406 A:middle
Okay, now I need to choose where

00:11:50.406 --> 00:11:52.536 A:middle
on Mars to go and I think we

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:53.966 A:middle
should check in on the NASA

00:11:53.966 --> 00:11:55.106 A:middle
Curiosity Rover.

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:56.416 A:middle
So let's go to Gale Creator.

00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:59.036 A:middle
We should definitely go after

00:11:59.106 --> 00:11:59.946 A:middle
the conference.
