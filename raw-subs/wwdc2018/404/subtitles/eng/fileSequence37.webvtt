00:36:59.806 --> 00:37:00.816 A:middle
So let's run through it and

00:37:00.816 --> 00:37:01.686 A:middle
check the shortcut that's

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
created.

00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:08.466 A:middle
Alright, I'm just going to go to

00:37:08.466 --> 00:37:09.686 A:middle
the same place as before.

00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:10.856 A:middle
I really like Gale Creator.

00:37:11.726 --> 00:37:14.386 A:middle
Okay, Browse, Mars, Gale

00:37:14.386 --> 00:37:17.186 A:middle
Creator, and let's not go for a

00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:17.386 A:middle
day.

00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:20.716 A:middle
We'll go -- Sure, that'll work.

00:37:21.136 --> 00:37:22.286 A:middle
Okay, this time I'm going to go

00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:23.466 A:middle
by myself because I want to

00:37:23.466 --> 00:37:24.396 A:middle
check the one case.

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:28.216 A:middle
There. When I tap Book, that

00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:30.326 A:middle
actually created the shortcut

00:37:30.326 --> 00:37:30.986 A:middle
and donated it.

00:37:31.406 --> 00:37:32.796 A:middle
So now we can go look at it.

00:37:33.236 --> 00:37:35.756 A:middle
you can find these under

00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:39.126 A:middle
Settings, Siri &amp; Search.

00:37:39.516 --> 00:37:42.066 A:middle
There. Book an expedition for

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:43.396 A:middle
one person.

00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:50.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:51.486 --> 00:37:53.226 A:middle
Alright, so this is great for

00:37:53.226 --> 00:37:53.636 A:middle
English.

00:37:53.636 --> 00:37:54.156 A:middle
I fixed it.

00:37:54.256 --> 00:37:55.236 A:middle
but I'm still going to need to

00:37:55.236 --> 00:37:57.066 A:middle
localize this into French.

00:37:57.176 --> 00:37:58.646 A:middle
And the great thing is, it's

00:37:58.756 --> 00:38:00.296 A:middle
just as easy as the first demo.
