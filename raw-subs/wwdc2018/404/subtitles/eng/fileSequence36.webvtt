00:35:59.206 --> 00:36:00.386 A:middle
So I'm going to swap that in.

00:36:00.886 --> 00:36:04.046 A:middle
Alright, say goodbye to this

00:36:04.046 --> 00:36:04.446 A:middle
guy.

00:36:04.446 --> 00:36:08.396 A:middle
And let's go find the finished

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:08.726 A:middle
one.

00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:18.006 A:middle
There we go.

00:36:18.526 --> 00:36:21.586 A:middle
Yes, Xcode, I want to make a

00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:22.096 A:middle
copy.

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:23.716 A:middle
There we go.

00:36:24.316 --> 00:36:25.866 A:middle
Alright, let's look at it.

00:36:28.376 --> 00:36:30.496 A:middle
So we're going to look at a case

00:36:30.496 --> 00:36:31.836 A:middle
where I fixed two problems at

00:36:31.836 --> 00:36:32.166 A:middle
once.

00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:35.906 A:middle
So if we check Book Expedition,

00:36:36.646 --> 00:36:38.266 A:middle
the string here is "Book a

00:36:38.266 --> 00:36:42.016 A:middle
expedition" but then in the

00:36:42.016 --> 00:36:43.006 A:middle
plural dictionary, I have the

00:36:43.006 --> 00:36:46.056 A:middle
case of one person or any other

00:36:46.056 --> 00:36:47.256 A:middle
number of people.

00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:50.166 A:middle
What I also did here was fix

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:52.406 A:middle
that a/an situation so the

00:36:52.406 --> 00:36:53.596 A:middle
string is actually displayed

00:36:53.596 --> 00:36:54.556 A:middle
we'll use an.

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:58.486 A:middle
Okay. So I have the finished

00:36:58.486 --> 00:36:59.656 A:middle
version of the app running on my

00:36:59.656 --> 00:36:59.746 A:middle
phone.

00:36:59.806 --> 00:37:00.816 A:middle
So let's run through it and
