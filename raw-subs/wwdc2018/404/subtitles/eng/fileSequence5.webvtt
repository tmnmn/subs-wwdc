00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:02.436 A:middle
So if we take a look at this

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.646 A:middle
example, so I have this phrase

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:06.196 A:middle
that says, "Booking confirmed"

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.416 A:middle
in English and it fits just fine

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:10.446 A:middle
on a Watch screen, but in

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:12.086 A:middle
French, for example, it

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:12.716 A:middle
truncates.

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:15.256 A:middle
So first of all, when it

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:16.536 A:middle
truncates, it doesn't look that

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:18.846 A:middle
nice in the UI and sometimes the

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:20.366 A:middle
truncation can change the

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:21.996 A:middle
meaning of the word.

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:23.826 A:middle
It can even be offensive for

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:24.556 A:middle
your users.

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:26.736 A:middle
It can be like funny, like in

00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:28.576 A:middle
this example, like the phase

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.896 A:middle
does not say that your booking

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:31.926 A:middle
was confirmed anymore.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:33.366 A:middle
It says our booking was stupid

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.306 A:middle
which is not what I really

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:34.826 A:middle
wanted.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:39.626 A:middle
So we see that context is very

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:40.976 A:middle
important to provide to your

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:43.386 A:middle
customers or to your localizers

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:45.016 A:middle
to ship high-quality

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:46.426 A:middle
localization.

00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:49.156 A:middle
So now I would like to introduce

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:51.416 A:middle
the Xcode Localization Catalog,

00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:53.506 A:middle
which is the new format for

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:55.646 A:middle
exporting and importing your

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.596 A:middle
localizations in Xcode 10.

00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:01.126 A:middle
So what is an Xcode Localization
