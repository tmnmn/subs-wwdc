00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:00.316 A:middle
enumerations.

00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:03.096 A:middle
This enumeration lets you book a

00:24:03.186 --> 00:24:04.776 A:middle
flight or it lets you book a

00:24:04.816 --> 00:24:06.396 A:middle
cruise, or it lets you book a

00:24:06.396 --> 00:24:07.486 A:middle
vacation package.

00:24:07.816 --> 00:24:10.216 A:middle
And when Xcode goes to localize

00:24:10.486 --> 00:24:12.336 A:middle
your intent definition file,

00:24:12.466 --> 00:24:13.646 A:middle
when you press that localize

00:24:13.646 --> 00:24:14.876 A:middle
button that Vivian showed you,

00:24:15.776 --> 00:24:18.116 A:middle
what's going to happen is Xcode

00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:22.046 A:middle
will produce one each of its

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:25.136 A:middle
strings for the members of that

00:24:25.136 --> 00:24:25.886 A:middle
enumeration.

00:24:26.356 --> 00:24:30.066 A:middle
And that happens to work because

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:31.926 A:middle
of the particular words we

00:24:31.926 --> 00:24:32.706 A:middle
chose.

00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:36.786 A:middle
Because our template says "Book

00:24:36.786 --> 00:24:38.676 A:middle
a flight" and uses that

00:24:38.676 --> 00:24:41.316 A:middle
indefinite article, we can or

00:24:41.686 --> 00:24:44.106 A:middle
"Book a type" and uses that

00:24:44.106 --> 00:24:46.106 A:middle
indefinite article, we can book

00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:47.986 A:middle
a flight, book a cruise, or book

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.606 A:middle
a vacation package because they

00:24:49.646 --> 00:24:51.326 A:middle
all start with consonants

00:24:51.526 --> 00:24:52.676 A:middle
because that's the rule in

00:24:52.676 --> 00:24:53.186 A:middle
English.

00:24:53.696 --> 00:24:55.966 A:middle
But what happens if I add a new

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:57.946 A:middle
value to my enumeration to

00:24:57.946 --> 00:24:59.496 A:middle
represent booking an expedition,

00:24:59.496 --> 00:24:59.966 A:middle
say to Mars?
