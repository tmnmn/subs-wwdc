00:15:56.556 --> 00:16:00.746 A:middle
Copy and Paste.

00:16:02.766 --> 00:16:04.046 A:middle
And I think this Travel Details

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.276 A:middle
one is going to be particularly

00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:06.626 A:middle
helpful because it has that

00:16:06.626 --> 00:16:09.646 A:middle
troublesome Book button in it.

00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:11.866 A:middle
Alright, now I'm ready to send

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:14.166 A:middle
my entire Xcode Localization

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:16.306 A:middle
Catalog off to my localizers.

00:16:16.856 --> 00:16:19.986 A:middle
Now the great thing is they're

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:21.426 A:middle
really fast and they're already

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:21.796 A:middle
done.

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:23.016 A:middle
So we can go ahead and import

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:23.896 A:middle
those translations.

00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:26.466 A:middle
Just going to go back to my

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:26.946 A:middle
project.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.196 A:middle
Make sure I have the project

00:16:29.246 --> 00:16:29.776 A:middle
selected.

00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:32.136 A:middle
And as before, go to Editor and

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:34.736 A:middle
this time choose Import

00:16:34.736 --> 00:16:35.536 A:middle
Localizations.

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:38.476 A:middle
Okay? So I'm going to pick my

00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:40.056 A:middle
Return to Xcode Localization

00:16:40.056 --> 00:16:40.566 A:middle
Catalog.

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:42.056 A:middle
Click Open.

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:45.256 A:middle
And now I get a comparison view

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:46.776 A:middle
the same as in Xcode 9 that

00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:48.486 A:middle
shows me any warnings, errors,

00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:49.766 A:middle
and changes regarding my

00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:50.366 A:middle
strings.

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:52.616 A:middle
So here, it's just warning me I

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:54.116 A:middle
didn't get any translations for

00:16:54.116 --> 00:16:55.606 A:middle
my infoplist.strings.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.706 A:middle
But that's okay.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:57.696 A:middle
I didn't ask for those

00:16:57.696 --> 00:16:59.066 A:middle
translations, so I'm just going

00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.166 A:middle
to ignore this warning.
