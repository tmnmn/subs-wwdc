00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:03.686 A:middle
And let's go for a month.

00:12:03.686 --> 00:12:05.236 A:middle
It's a really fast spaceship.

00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:07.546 A:middle
I'm going to take Sara and Chris

00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:08.706 A:middle
with me, so three travelers.

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:11.346 A:middle
That's a really cheap trip to

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:11.636 A:middle
Mars.

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:14.256 A:middle
Alright, here's that Book button

00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:15.046 A:middle
you saw earlier.

00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:17.116 A:middle
And great, our booking is

00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:17.656 A:middle
confirmed.

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:20.106 A:middle
Now, of course, there's people

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.806 A:middle
all over Earth who would love to

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.656 A:middle
visit Mars and they don't all

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:25.506 A:middle
use their iOS devices in

00:12:25.506 --> 00:12:26.096 A:middle
English.

00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:27.336 A:middle
So we're going to need to

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:29.166 A:middle
localize the app.

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:32.756 A:middle
Let's go into Xcode and do that.

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:34.626 A:middle
Alright, so I just need to

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:36.866 A:middle
select my project here.

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:38.286 A:middle
And under Info, under

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.796 A:middle
Localizations, click Plus, and

00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:41.986 A:middle
we're going to add French for

00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:42.526 A:middle
starters.

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:47.086 A:middle
Okay. So my storyboards are

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.756 A:middle
localizable by default, so

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:49.586 A:middle
they're already checked.

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:51.356 A:middle
And a have a localizable

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:53.306 A:middle
stringsdict that I also already

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:54.406 A:middle
marked localizable.

00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:55.916 A:middle
So I just need to click Finish.

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:59.656 A:middle
Alright, at this point, Xcode

00:12:59.686 --> 00:13:01.696 A:middle
has created the fr.lproj in my
