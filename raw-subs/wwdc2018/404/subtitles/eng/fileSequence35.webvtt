00:34:59.746 --> 00:35:00.576 A:middle
I need to make sure I get the

00:35:00.576 --> 00:35:01.776 A:middle
name exactly right.

00:35:03.096 --> 00:35:04.196 A:middle
Intents. Okay.

00:35:06.676 --> 00:35:11.386 A:middle
Create. Now I don't need to go

00:35:11.386 --> 00:35:13.116 A:middle
into my French strings file to

00:35:13.186 --> 00:35:15.186 A:middle
find the ID for my intent.

00:35:15.946 --> 00:35:17.876 A:middle
I can actually go into the

00:35:17.876 --> 00:35:19.776 A:middle
intent definition file because

00:35:19.776 --> 00:35:21.186 A:middle
these are required to be unique.

00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:23.956 A:middle
I can actually copy directly

00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:29.076 A:middle
from here, alright, copy, and go

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:33.966 A:middle
my stringsdict, and paste.

00:35:35.286 --> 00:35:39.306 A:middle
Alright, you can see here Xcode

00:35:39.306 --> 00:35:40.346 A:middle
actually formatted the

00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:42.896 A:middle
parameters for me when I pasted

00:35:42.896 --> 00:35:44.316 A:middle
so that this is already ready

00:35:44.616 --> 00:35:45.906 A:middle
for Siri Shortcuts.

00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:48.496 A:middle
Okay, so at this point, I'm

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:49.966 A:middle
ready to fill in the rest of my

00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:50.906 A:middle
plural dictionary.

00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:52.566 A:middle
I'm only going to need one and

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:53.956 A:middle
other because I'm doing English.

00:35:53.956 --> 00:35:55.226 A:middle
So I have singular and plural.

00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:57.796 A:middle
But like any good cooking show,

00:35:57.796 --> 00:35:59.106 A:middle
I have the finished file ready.

00:35:59.206 --> 00:36:00.386 A:middle
So I'm going to swap that in.
