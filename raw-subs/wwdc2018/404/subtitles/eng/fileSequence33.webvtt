00:32:59.026 --> 00:33:01.376 A:middle
can be a flight, a cruise, a

00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:03.146 A:middle
vacation package, or an

00:33:03.146 --> 00:33:03.956 A:middle
expedition.

00:33:05.136 --> 00:33:06.776 A:middle
Now if our user follows through

00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:08.186 A:middle
with a suggestion and books

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.636 A:middle
another trip, we need to give

00:33:09.636 --> 00:33:10.916 A:middle
them some kind of feedback.

00:33:11.446 --> 00:33:13.196 A:middle
So for that we have a response

00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:15.226 A:middle
and there's just a success or a

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.226 A:middle
failure message as to whether we

00:33:17.226 --> 00:33:18.616 A:middle
could book their trip.

00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:20.446 A:middle
And this is likewise a

00:33:20.446 --> 00:33:22.156 A:middle
combination of parameters.

00:33:22.726 --> 00:33:25.276 A:middle
Now, of course, since we have

00:33:25.276 --> 00:33:27.226 A:middle
user facing strings, we need to

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:28.036 A:middle
localize them.

00:33:28.316 --> 00:33:28.956 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:31.786 A:middle
Just like I did for the image, I

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:33.756 A:middle
just go to the right here, click

00:33:33.756 --> 00:33:34.316 A:middle
Localize.

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:36.986 A:middle
Now intent definition files are

00:33:36.986 --> 00:33:38.126 A:middle
going to be like interface

00:33:38.196 --> 00:33:39.796 A:middle
builder files where we have one

00:33:39.796 --> 00:33:41.766 A:middle
intent definition and all of our

00:33:41.766 --> 00:33:43.686 A:middle
translations in strings files.

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.456 A:middle
So I want to put it in base.

00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:47.576 A:middle
Click Localize.

00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:50.746 A:middle
Okay. And I want to check

00:33:51.216 --> 00:33:51.676 A:middle
French.

00:33:52.766 --> 00:33:54.476 A:middle
Okay, so at this point, Xcode

00:33:54.476 --> 00:33:56.846 A:middle
has created a strings file for

00:33:56.846 --> 00:33:58.416 A:middle
the French translations to be

00:33:58.416 --> 00:33:58.916 A:middle
put in.
