00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.536 A:middle
And finally, it has the version

00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:04.196 A:middle
number of the exported

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:05.426 A:middle
Localization Catalog.

00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:09.166 A:middle
Next inside the generated xcloc,

00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:11.986 A:middle
you will find Localized Contents

00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:12.696 A:middle
directory.

00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:14.876 A:middle
And Localized Contents contains

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:16.436 A:middle
all of your localizable

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:18.886 A:middle
resources in the project and

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:20.816 A:middle
this is the main directory where

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:22.566 A:middle
your localizers will be doing

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:23.326 A:middle
their work in.

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:26.986 A:middle
So inside Localized Contents, as

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.736 A:middle
I mentioned, you will find an

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.096 A:middle
XLIFF document that has all the

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.456 A:middle
project localized strings as

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:36.606 A:middle
well as non-strings localizable

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:38.826 A:middle
assets like images, for example,

00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:40.265 A:middle
if you want to localize those.

00:08:40.996 --> 00:08:42.246 A:middle
So those assets will be

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:44.176 A:middle
organized into the same file

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:46.276 A:middle
system hierarchy as your Xcode

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:48.096 A:middle
projects inside the Localization

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:48.616 A:middle
Catalog.

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:51.956 A:middle
And your localizers can also use

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:54.306 A:middle
Localized Content to override

00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:57.016 A:middle
any resources specifically for

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.726 A:middle
the language like interface

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.336 A:middle
builder files, for example.
