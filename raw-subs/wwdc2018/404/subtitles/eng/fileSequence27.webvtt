00:26:59.206 --> 00:27:01.666 A:middle
shortcut is the string "Book a

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:04.696 A:middle
cruise for 1 people" which isn't

00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:05.796 A:middle
grammatical English.

00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:08.936 A:middle
However, these support

00:27:09.046 --> 00:27:11.796 A:middle
stringsdict files as well so you

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:14.116 A:middle
can do all of the pluralization

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:16.746 A:middle
that you need and have the

00:27:16.856 --> 00:27:18.766 A:middle
system take care of it for you.

00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:23.076 A:middle
Here in the stringsdict file, we

00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:26.706 A:middle
have the dictionary itself keyed

00:27:26.706 --> 00:27:29.156 A:middle
by that string that I showed you

00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:31.196 A:middle
from the strings file.

00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.506 A:middle
You can either use that or you

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:37.196 A:middle
can use the ID as the key.

00:27:37.196 --> 00:27:40.676 A:middle
And then we've produced another

00:27:40.676 --> 00:27:42.576 A:middle
string that is what is actually

00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:44.236 A:middle
going to be shown in the user

00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:44.906 A:middle
interface.

00:27:46.376 --> 00:27:48.366 A:middle
And here, we're referring to

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.656 A:middle
another variable which can then

00:27:50.656 --> 00:27:52.816 A:middle
be substituted for either the

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:55.976 A:middle
one or other cases based on

00:27:56.046 --> 00:27:57.956 A:middle
English's pluralization rules.

00:27:58.466 --> 00:28:02.156 A:middle
