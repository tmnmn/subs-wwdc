00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:01.376 A:middle
Now Taylor and I will take you

00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:03.026 A:middle
through the engineering basics

00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:05.586 A:middle
of adopting Dark Mode in macOS

00:27:05.586 --> 00:27:06.116 A:middle
Mojave.

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:12.046 A:middle
A while back, Taylor and I were

00:27:12.046 --> 00:27:13.516 A:middle
chatting, and we discovered that

00:27:13.516 --> 00:27:15.896 A:middle
we were both huge fans of

00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:16.626 A:middle
chameleons.

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:18.926 A:middle
And while we don't yet own our

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:20.406 A:middle
own pet chameleons, we thought

00:27:20.406 --> 00:27:22.266 A:middle
we'd be prepared by writing an

00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:24.276 A:middle
app called Chameleon Wrangler.

00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:26.666 A:middle
We did this back in High Sierra,

00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:28.726 A:middle
and so we thought, "Hey, let's

00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:29.996 A:middle
update it for Mojave."

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:33.506 A:middle
The first thing we did was put

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:35.266 A:middle
our system in Dark Mode and

00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:37.946 A:middle
launch our app from the dock.

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.116 A:middle
And it didn't really look too

00:27:40.116 --> 00:27:40.466 A:middle
dark.

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.056 A:middle
In fact, it's exactly the same

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:45.556 A:middle
between light and dark.

00:27:46.796 --> 00:27:48.386 A:middle
And you'll note throughout this

00:27:48.386 --> 00:27:49.926 A:middle
portion of the talk that on the

00:27:49.926 --> 00:27:51.316 A:middle
left, when we want to compare,

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:52.616 A:middle
we'll have the light on the left

00:27:52.616 --> 00:27:53.616 A:middle
and the dark on the right, so

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:54.986 A:middle
you can compare them side by

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:55.376 A:middle
side.

00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:57.206 A:middle
Can't actually run the system

00:27:57.206 --> 00:27:57.726 A:middle
this way.

00:27:57.756 --> 00:27:58.536 A:middle
It's just for show.
