00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:01.126 A:middle
In light appearance, the group

00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:02.966 A:middle
boxes have a dark fill behind

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:05.756 A:middle
them and are shaded such along

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:07.586 A:middle
the edges to give them a

00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:09.216 A:middle
recessed quality such that they

00:07:09.216 --> 00:07:10.346 A:middle
look like they're carved into

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
the window background that

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:12.436 A:middle
they're inside of.

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:16.166 A:middle
In Dark Mode, however, the group

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.586 A:middle
boxes are treated almost as if

00:07:17.586 --> 00:07:19.176 A:middle
they are self-illuminated.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:22.156 A:middle
But, at the end of the day, the

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:23.856 A:middle
general purpose of the group box

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:24.916 A:middle
is the same between the two

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:27.016 A:middle
modes in that what they're

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:28.066 A:middle
really trying to communicate to

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:29.526 A:middle
the user is that the contents

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:31.406 A:middle
contained therein are all

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:32.316 A:middle
related somehow.

00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:35.956 A:middle
Why I said that it was important

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:38.166 A:middle
to go on a case-by-case basis

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.976 A:middle
and try and determine what the

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:43.176 A:middle
visual cue that your elements

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:45.266 A:middle
are trying to communicate-- It's

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:46.916 A:middle
important, is because, in some

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.306 A:middle
cases, the visual cue that's

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:50.206 A:middle
being communicated is already

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:51.506 A:middle
effective enough in the Light

00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:53.376 A:middle
Mode and should be left as is in

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:53.916 A:middle
Dark Mode.

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:56.086 A:middle
An example of this are the

00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:56.906 A:middle
window shadows.

00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
As we all know, macOS is a
