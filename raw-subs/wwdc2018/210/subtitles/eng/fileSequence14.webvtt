00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:00.456 A:middle
have very color-sensitive

00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:02.456 A:middle
content or just generally would

00:14:02.456 --> 00:14:03.776 A:middle
prefer not to have the desktop

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:07.996 A:middle
tinting apply to their UI, we

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:09.986 A:middle
offer the Graphite Mode so that

00:14:09.986 --> 00:14:11.466 A:middle
they can disable the color

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:15.106 A:middle
tinting altogether.

00:14:15.106 --> 00:14:16.946 A:middle
If we take a look at the color

00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:18.106 A:middle
swatches for the window

00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
background colors, along the top

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:21.546 A:middle
there, we can see the window

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:23.406 A:middle
background color in the Light

00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:25.586 A:middle
Mode, which is the standard

00:14:25.646 --> 00:14:26.546 A:middle
light gray that we're all

00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:27.416 A:middle
accustomed to.

00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:28.746 A:middle
And, in the middle there, we've

00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:30.126 A:middle
got the under page background

00:14:30.126 --> 00:14:31.876 A:middle
color, which is a mid-tone gray,

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:34.196 A:middle
and then we've got the content

00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:35.836 A:middle
background, which is the white

00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:36.936 A:middle
background color that we're all

00:14:36.936 --> 00:14:38.976 A:middle
familiar with behind all of our

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:39.806 A:middle
content areas.

00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:42.016 A:middle
In the middle row, you can see

00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:43.876 A:middle
how the desktop tinting affects

00:14:43.986 --> 00:14:45.636 A:middle
these colors, and, then, along

00:14:45.636 --> 00:14:46.896 A:middle
the bottom, you can see the

00:14:46.896 --> 00:14:48.476 A:middle
effects of the graphite accent

00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:50.456 A:middle
color disabling the desktop

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:51.146 A:middle
tinting effect.

00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:55.636 A:middle
So, now that we've gone over

00:14:55.636 --> 00:14:56.866 A:middle
some of the design principles,

00:14:57.036 --> 00:14:58.276 A:middle
let's go into a little bit of

00:14:58.276 --> 00:14:59.426 A:middle
the design considerations that

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.506 A:middle
you should take into account
