00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.506 A:middle
you should take into account

00:15:00.506 --> 00:15:03.316 A:middle
when updating your apps.

00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:04.416 A:middle
First, let's talk about colors.

00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:08.746 A:middle
For macOS 10.14, we added a lot

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:09.286 A:middle
of colors.

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:12.056 A:middle
We also removed a lot of colors,

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:15.446 A:middle
updated some, and, as you can

00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:16.706 A:middle
see behind me, these are some of

00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:17.616 A:middle
our system colors.

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:19.696 A:middle
Along the bottom, we've got the

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.026 A:middle
dark variance of the colors,

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:23.506 A:middle
and, as you can see, the dark

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:24.916 A:middle
versions are generally a little

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:26.626 A:middle
bit brighter and more saturated.

00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:29.356 A:middle
Rachel and Taylor are going to a

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:30.636 A:middle
little bit deeper into the color

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:32.266 A:middle
usage during their portion of

00:15:32.316 --> 00:15:34.136 A:middle
today's session, but, for now, I

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.656 A:middle
just generally want to try and

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:36.566 A:middle
cover three colors in

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:38.356 A:middle
particular, which are the blues.

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:41.086 A:middle
Going from left to right, we've

00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:42.336 A:middle
got controlAccentColor,

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.456 A:middle
systemBlueColor, and linkColor.

00:15:45.146 --> 00:15:47.076 A:middle
Linkcolor, as the name implies,

00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:49.936 A:middle
is meant to be applied to links,

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:51.156 A:middle
text links in particular.

00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:53.536 A:middle
So, things that are hyperlinks,

00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:55.576 A:middle
taking of the user to a website,

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:57.456 A:middle
or a link within your

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.846 A:middle
application that navigates the

00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:00.336 A:middle
user to another area of your
