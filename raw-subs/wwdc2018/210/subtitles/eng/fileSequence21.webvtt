00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:00.826 A:middle
a white tag with a dark eyelet

00:21:00.946 --> 00:21:01.346 A:middle
cutout.

00:21:01.936 --> 00:21:03.286 A:middle
On the right side, however, in

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:05.406 A:middle
Dark Mode, that sense of it

00:21:05.406 --> 00:21:06.976 A:middle
being a white sheet of paper is

00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:07.336 A:middle
lost.

00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:09.636 A:middle
So, once we invert it, we get

00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:10.936 A:middle
back that white sheet of paper

00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:13.126 A:middle
with an eyelet knockout hole.

00:21:14.286 --> 00:21:15.386 A:middle
Looking at how this is

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:18.976 A:middle
constructed, generally, what you

00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:23.056 A:middle
would do is expand the clipping

00:21:23.056 --> 00:21:24.686 A:middle
paths, I should say, and then

00:21:24.906 --> 00:21:27.416 A:middle
select your eyelet shape and

00:21:27.416 --> 00:21:28.756 A:middle
then reverse the knockout on

00:21:29.506 --> 00:21:29.606 A:middle
that.

00:21:29.606 --> 00:21:31.006 A:middle
And then it's just a game of

00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:35.386 A:middle
selecting any redundant vector

00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:38.896 A:middle
paths and removing those.

00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:40.896 A:middle
Taking a look at a slightly more

00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:42.856 A:middle
complex shape, for example, the

00:21:42.856 --> 00:21:43.226 A:middle
house.

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:46.246 A:middle
We've got a white house on the

00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:47.396 A:middle
left side, and on the right

00:21:47.426 --> 00:21:48.566 A:middle
side, the house isn't white

00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:48.996 A:middle
anymore.

00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:52.056 A:middle
So, inverting it returns us back

00:21:52.106 --> 00:21:54.936 A:middle
to a white painted house.

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:57.196 A:middle
Generally, the construction for

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.626 A:middle
this is about the same as the

00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:02.376 A:middle
other process, but one important
