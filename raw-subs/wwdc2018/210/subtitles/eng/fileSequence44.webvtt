00:43:59.696 --> 00:44:00.756 A:middle
controlAccentColor.

00:44:02.676 --> 00:44:04.046 A:middle
The next problem here with the

00:44:04.046 --> 00:44:05.516 A:middle
tab bar is a little more subtle.

00:44:06.366 --> 00:44:07.956 A:middle
If we bring our cursor over and

00:44:08.056 --> 00:44:10.046 A:middle
press down on it, we can see

00:44:10.046 --> 00:44:11.086 A:middle
that we're getting a darkening

00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:12.406 A:middle
effect instead of the

00:44:12.406 --> 00:44:13.546 A:middle
brightening effect that we

00:44:13.546 --> 00:44:14.586 A:middle
should in Dark Mode.

00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:16.986 A:middle
This is because we are taking

00:44:16.986 --> 00:44:18.256 A:middle
that base color and just

00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:20.006 A:middle
applying a constant 30%

00:44:20.006 --> 00:44:21.856 A:middle
darkening effect to it, assuming

00:44:21.856 --> 00:44:23.116 A:middle
that would look fine in the

00:44:23.116 --> 00:44:24.506 A:middle
light appearance.

00:44:25.576 --> 00:44:27.356 A:middle
Instead, we want to describe

00:44:27.356 --> 00:44:28.666 A:middle
something that basically this

00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:30.976 A:middle
color is being pressed, and that

00:44:30.976 --> 00:44:33.726 A:middle
semantic description can carry

00:44:33.726 --> 00:44:35.316 A:middle
whatever effect it needs to in

00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:36.176 A:middle
the light versus dark

00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:37.416 A:middle
appearance.

00:44:37.416 --> 00:44:38.596 A:middle
So, with the new system effect

00:44:38.596 --> 00:44:41.546 A:middle
API in Mojave on NSColor, we can

00:44:41.546 --> 00:44:42.946 A:middle
describe that exact semantic.

00:44:43.836 --> 00:44:45.036 A:middle
We can take our base color of

00:44:45.036 --> 00:44:46.806 A:middle
controlAccentColor, say that we

00:44:46.806 --> 00:44:47.876 A:middle
want to get the pressed variant,

00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:49.656 A:middle
and it will react appropriately

00:44:49.746 --> 00:44:51.026 A:middle
in both the light and dark

00:44:51.026 --> 00:44:52.246 A:middle
appearance.

00:44:54.936 --> 00:44:56.316 A:middle
There's one more area of our

00:44:56.316 --> 00:44:57.726 A:middle
application where you can see

00:44:57.836 --> 00:44:59.586 A:middle
the accent color, and that's in

00:44:59.586 --> 00:45:01.076 A:middle
