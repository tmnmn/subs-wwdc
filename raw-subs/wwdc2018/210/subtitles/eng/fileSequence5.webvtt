00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:01.786 A:middle
So going into the design for

00:05:01.786 --> 00:05:03.406 A:middle
Dark Mode, we really wanted to

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:04.346 A:middle
acknowledge all of these

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.246 A:middle
aesthetic associations that we

00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:08.306 A:middle
all have with dark interfaces,

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.986 A:middle
while at the same time embracing

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:12.536 A:middle
a lot of the real benefits that

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:14.496 A:middle
a dark design offers you, such

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:16.256 A:middle
as a higher contrast for

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:18.136 A:middle
typography.

00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:20.426 A:middle
We realize that Dark Mode is

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.176 A:middle
really, really cool, and that a

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:23.216 A:middle
lot of you are going to want to

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:24.656 A:middle
adopt Dark Mode on your apps

00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:25.436 A:middle
permanently.

00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.666 A:middle
But, in actuality, only a small

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:29.016 A:middle
subset of apps really should be

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:31.666 A:middle
dark all the time, and those are

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.646 A:middle
things that are media-centric or

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:34.856 A:middle
content-creation apps.

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:35.886 A:middle
Those are the ones that are best

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:37.246 A:middle
suited to staying dark all the

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:38.766 A:middle
time, so if your app doesn't

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:39.516 A:middle
fall into one of those

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:41.366 A:middle
categories, it's better to let

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:42.686 A:middle
your app follow what the system

00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:43.876 A:middle
appearance is, rather than to

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.046 A:middle
make it dark permanently.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:49.606 A:middle
The second principle was that

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.576 A:middle
dark interfaces are not just

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:52.146 A:middle
inverted.

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:53.886 A:middle
And, really, what's at the core

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.356 A:middle
here is that when you look at a

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.946 A:middle
dark interface, it can sometimes

00:05:57.996 --> 00:06:00.416 A:middle
be easy to think of just taking
