00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:00.216 A:middle
intending to represent.

00:47:00.216 --> 00:47:02.226 A:middle
For instance, for a custom menu

00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:03.426 A:middle
like UI, you would want to use

00:47:03.466 --> 00:47:04.296 A:middle
the menu material.

00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:06.196 A:middle
And these not only adjust for

00:47:06.196 --> 00:47:07.976 A:middle
Dark Mode, but guarantee that UI

00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:10.246 A:middle
to always match those materials

00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:11.556 A:middle
even when the system changes in

00:47:11.556 --> 00:47:11.986 A:middle
the future.

00:47:13.156 --> 00:47:14.236 A:middle
We've had a few of these in the

00:47:14.236 --> 00:47:16.646 A:middle
past, but in Mojave, we have

00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:17.966 A:middle
several more so that you can

00:47:17.966 --> 00:47:19.346 A:middle
make sure to really tailor your

00:47:19.346 --> 00:47:21.496 A:middle
custom UI to match the material

00:47:21.596 --> 00:47:24.936 A:middle
it needs to.

00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:26.506 A:middle
Jumping back to our photo here,

00:47:26.506 --> 00:47:27.516 A:middle
we can see that we were using

00:47:27.516 --> 00:47:28.706 A:middle
the mediumLight material,

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:29.776 A:middle
because we were trying to

00:47:29.776 --> 00:47:31.496 A:middle
represent Quick Look style

00:47:31.496 --> 00:47:32.426 A:middle
popover windows.

00:47:33.126 --> 00:47:34.296 A:middle
And instead, we can just simply

00:47:34.296 --> 00:47:35.556 A:middle
swap that over to the popover

00:47:35.556 --> 00:47:37.206 A:middle
material and get the exact

00:47:37.206 --> 00:47:41.046 A:middle
effect we want to in Dark Mode.

00:47:41.266 --> 00:47:42.856 A:middle
Now, this isn't the only area

00:47:42.856 --> 00:47:45.076 A:middle
where we get a unique material

00:47:45.076 --> 00:47:46.366 A:middle
showing in the background of our

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:46.516 A:middle
UI.

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:48.666 A:middle
Like Raymond talked about,

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:50.146 A:middle
there's this desktop tinting

00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:51.596 A:middle
effect that's shown here in the

00:47:51.596 --> 00:47:52.916 A:middle
background of our photo gallery.

00:47:53.436 --> 00:47:54.306 A:middle
We're getting a little bit of

00:47:54.306 --> 00:47:55.396 A:middle
that blue from that desktop

00:47:55.396 --> 00:47:57.146 A:middle
behind it, creating this really

00:47:57.146 --> 00:47:58.486 A:middle
visually harmonious result.

00:47:59.516 --> 00:48:00.836 A:middle
It's a lot easier to see on top
