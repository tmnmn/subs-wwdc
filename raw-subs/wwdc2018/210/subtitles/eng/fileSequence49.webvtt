00:49:00.776 --> 00:49:01.776 A:middle
We've seen a number of places

00:49:01.776 --> 00:49:02.826 A:middle
across this system that were

00:49:02.826 --> 00:49:04.196 A:middle
actually able to improve their

00:49:04.196 --> 00:49:05.996 A:middle
Dark Mode support by deleting an

00:49:05.996 --> 00:49:07.916 A:middle
override of these default colors

00:49:08.296 --> 00:49:09.186 A:middle
that these views have.

00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:12.546 A:middle
If you want to customize beyond

00:49:12.606 --> 00:49:13.816 A:middle
the default color that these

00:49:13.816 --> 00:49:15.666 A:middle
views have, you can explicitly

00:49:15.666 --> 00:49:17.556 A:middle
set a variety of system colors

00:49:17.626 --> 00:49:19.346 A:middle
as their background color to get

00:49:19.346 --> 00:49:20.926 A:middle
the exact material effect you

00:49:20.926 --> 00:49:21.216 A:middle
want.

00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:24.446 A:middle
One really important note here,

00:49:24.446 --> 00:49:25.986 A:middle
though, is that if you were to

00:49:25.986 --> 00:49:27.396 A:middle
read the RGB values of these

00:49:27.396 --> 00:49:29.166 A:middle
colors, they would not include

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:29.946 A:middle
the desktop tint.

00:49:30.836 --> 00:49:31.796 A:middle
This is because, as Raymond

00:49:31.796 --> 00:49:32.816 A:middle
mentioned, this tint is

00:49:32.816 --> 00:49:33.876 A:middle
extremely dynamic.

00:49:34.306 --> 00:49:35.606 A:middle
As you move your window around

00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:36.956 A:middle
on screen, that's getting

00:49:36.956 --> 00:49:38.596 A:middle
updated asynchronously to the

00:49:38.596 --> 00:49:40.576 A:middle
applications rendering itself,

00:49:40.576 --> 00:49:41.536 A:middle
creating a really nice

00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:43.456 A:middle
experience as the user is moving

00:49:43.456 --> 00:49:44.336 A:middle
around windows.

00:49:45.556 --> 00:49:46.886 A:middle
So, jumping back to Chameleon

00:49:46.886 --> 00:49:48.396 A:middle
Wrangler, we automatically got

00:49:48.396 --> 00:49:49.976 A:middle
this content background because

00:49:49.976 --> 00:49:51.226 A:middle
we just use a stock

00:49:51.226 --> 00:49:52.006 A:middle
NSCollectionView.

00:49:53.456 --> 00:49:55.006 A:middle
In the vital section, we got

00:49:55.006 --> 00:49:56.196 A:middle
that window background material

00:49:56.196 --> 00:49:57.466 A:middle
showing through because we had

00:49:57.466 --> 00:49:58.996 A:middle
nothing opaque covering it up.
