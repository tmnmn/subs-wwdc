00:51:58.996 --> 00:52:00.546 A:middle
dark appearance, which our

00:52:00.546 --> 00:52:01.876 A:middle
designers have meticulously

00:52:01.876 --> 00:52:03.976 A:middle
crafted with redefining

00:52:03.976 --> 00:52:05.406 A:middle
everything across the system.

00:52:06.926 --> 00:52:07.886 A:middle
When the system is running in

00:52:07.886 --> 00:52:09.416 A:middle
Dark Mode, what happens is that

00:52:09.416 --> 00:52:10.586 A:middle
the dark appearance gets applied

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:11.916 A:middle
to your application instead of

00:52:11.916 --> 00:52:13.306 A:middle
the light appearance.

00:52:13.406 --> 00:52:14.776 A:middle
So, when labelColor goes to draw

00:52:14.776 --> 00:52:16.376 A:middle
itself, it references the dark

00:52:16.376 --> 00:52:18.036 A:middle
appearance as white value

00:52:18.076 --> 00:52:19.146 A:middle
instead of the light appearance

00:52:19.146 --> 00:52:19.866 A:middle
as darker value.

00:52:20.716 --> 00:52:21.666 A:middle
The same is true for all of

00:52:21.666 --> 00:52:22.526 A:middle
those materials.

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.916 A:middle
And these aren't the only

00:52:25.006 --> 00:52:26.376 A:middle
materials in the system.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.856 A:middle
Right, these aren't the only

00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:28.836 A:middle
appearances in the system.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:30.466 A:middle
There are also the high contrast

00:52:30.466 --> 00:52:32.216 A:middle
appearances, which get used when

00:52:32.216 --> 00:52:33.486 A:middle
the accessibility high contrast

00:52:33.486 --> 00:52:35.046 A:middle
setting is turned on, these will

00:52:35.046 --> 00:52:36.266 A:middle
get applied to your application

00:52:36.266 --> 00:52:36.666 A:middle
instead.

00:52:36.726 --> 00:52:38.906 A:middle
And there's actually even more.

00:52:39.316 --> 00:52:40.026 A:middle
There are the vibrant

00:52:40.026 --> 00:52:40.976 A:middle
appearances that, again,

00:52:40.976 --> 00:52:42.366 A:middle
completely redefine all of these

00:52:42.366 --> 00:52:44.536 A:middle
colors that appear in sidebars

00:52:44.536 --> 00:52:45.416 A:middle
and titlebars.

00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:48.046 A:middle
And the advanced Dark Mode talk

00:52:48.046 --> 00:52:49.106 A:middle
is going to go into more detail

00:52:49.106 --> 00:52:50.156 A:middle
about how you can effectively

00:52:50.156 --> 00:52:51.746 A:middle
use the assets that come out of

00:52:51.746 --> 00:52:53.216 A:middle
those vibrant appearances to

00:52:53.216 --> 00:52:54.336 A:middle
really make them stand out.

00:52:55.986 --> 00:52:59.706 A:middle
Now, by default, the appearance

00:52:59.706 --> 00:53:01.196 A:middle
of your application will follow
