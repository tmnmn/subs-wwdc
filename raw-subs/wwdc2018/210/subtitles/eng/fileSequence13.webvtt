00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.946 A:middle
actually, we take a sample of

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:01.936 A:middle
the desktop portion that is

00:13:01.976 --> 00:13:04.626 A:middle
behind the window, and then we

00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:07.416 A:middle
derive a average color for that

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:09.656 A:middle
area, and then we blend that

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:12.426 A:middle
average color with a gray, which

00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:13.566 A:middle
then becomes the window

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:14.346 A:middle
background color.

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:16.406 A:middle
This background color is

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.366 A:middle
dynamic, so as the user moves

00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:19.596 A:middle
the window around the screen,

00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:21.186 A:middle
the color will update itself so

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:22.456 A:middle
that the window always stays in

00:13:22.456 --> 00:13:24.326 A:middle
sync with the wallpaper portion

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.176 A:middle
that was behind it.

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.566 A:middle
So, if we look at the effect in

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:29.746 A:middle
action across a couple of

00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:31.656 A:middle
different wallpapers, you can

00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:32.916 A:middle
see that the window is adjusting

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:34.676 A:middle
itself on the right side to

00:13:34.676 --> 00:13:37.196 A:middle
match the desktop picture that

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:37.816 A:middle
is behind it.

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:41.196 A:middle
Not only does the window

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:44.106 A:middle
background color adjust itself

00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:45.526 A:middle
to take advantage of the desktop

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:47.566 A:middle
color, but the controls also get

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:48.666 A:middle
a little bit of that going

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:49.986 A:middle
through them also due to the

00:13:49.986 --> 00:13:51.146 A:middle
control's opacity.

00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:56.696 A:middle
For users that work in

00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:58.756 A:middle
color-sensitive applications or

00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:00.456 A:middle
have very color-sensitive
