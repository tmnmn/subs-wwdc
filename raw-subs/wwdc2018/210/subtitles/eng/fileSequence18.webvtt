00:17:57.946 --> 00:18:00.466 A:middle
just use opacities, in this

00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:02.726 A:middle
case, opacities of white.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.276 A:middle
But while it's true that some

00:18:05.276 --> 00:18:06.636 A:middle
color contribution from the

00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:08.156 A:middle
background is occurring through

00:18:08.156 --> 00:18:12.206 A:middle
the materials here-- and that's

00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:12.946 A:middle
happening because of the

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.456 A:middle
opacity-- the end result is

00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:16.346 A:middle
actually not as highly saturated

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.336 A:middle
as we would desire.

00:18:17.446 --> 00:18:19.546 A:middle
And, as you can see along the

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:22.946 A:middle
bottom with the Quaternary Label

00:18:22.946 --> 00:18:25.396 A:middle
Color, the legibility is a

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:26.446 A:middle
little bit compromised.

00:18:27.696 --> 00:18:29.216 A:middle
Instead, what you want to do is

00:18:29.266 --> 00:18:30.576 A:middle
construct these using opaque

00:18:30.756 --> 00:18:31.636 A:middle
grayscale colors.

00:18:32.416 --> 00:18:34.786 A:middle
One thing to note here is that

00:18:34.886 --> 00:18:37.266 A:middle
the text color for the RGB label

00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:39.756 A:middle
colors here are full black.

00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:42.726 A:middle
What's going to happen once the

00:18:42.726 --> 00:18:44.146 A:middle
Blend Mode is applied is that

00:18:44.216 --> 00:18:46.406 A:middle
the text that is black is going

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:47.806 A:middle
to become completely

00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:48.466 A:middle
transparent.

00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:50.046 A:middle
So, if you have areas of your

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.316 A:middle
content that need to be treated

00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:53.236 A:middle
as a knockout, use full opaque

00:18:53.326 --> 00:18:54.956 A:middle
black, and if you have areas

00:18:54.956 --> 00:18:56.626 A:middle
that need to be gradiate towards

00:18:56.896 --> 00:18:59.226 A:middle
an opacity, use a gray that is

00:18:59.456 --> 00:19:00.706 A:middle
ramping itself towards a full
