00:09:59.226 --> 00:10:01.396 A:middle
to tell what the content is,

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.366 A:middle
where to focus your attention

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.606 A:middle
to, especially when there are

00:10:04.606 --> 00:10:06.286 A:middle
lots of windows on the screen.

00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:08.386 A:middle
And part of the reason for that

00:10:08.386 --> 00:10:09.956 A:middle
is because a lot of the content

00:10:10.006 --> 00:10:11.186 A:middle
that we all create is just

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:12.456 A:middle
bright in general.

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:16.336 A:middle
However, in a dark UI, the

00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:18.326 A:middle
content stands out because of

00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:20.206 A:middle
the background being pretty

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:21.246 A:middle
dark.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.676 A:middle
All of the window chrome in the

00:10:22.676 --> 00:10:24.756 A:middle
background generally just melts

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:26.466 A:middle
away, and the content becomes

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:27.646 A:middle
the primary focus of your

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:28.136 A:middle
attention.

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.246 A:middle
Generally, we found that there

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:32.096 A:middle
were three methods for how to

00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:33.996 A:middle
treat your content regions

00:10:33.996 --> 00:10:35.656 A:middle
inside of your windows to

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:37.406 A:middle
optimize the content focus.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:39.926 A:middle
The first method was to just

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:42.466 A:middle
generally go completely dark.

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:43.946 A:middle
An app like Finder is a great

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:45.076 A:middle
example of where this is

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:47.246 A:middle
possible because of the way that

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.396 A:middle
the content is displayed.

00:10:48.936 --> 00:10:50.646 A:middle
Finder's content are displayed

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:53.316 A:middle
as colorful file icons and so

00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:54.516 A:middle
the dark background really helps

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:56.606 A:middle
the icons stand out as much as

00:10:58.106 --> 00:10:58.536 A:middle
possible.

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:00.626 A:middle
The second method was to leave
