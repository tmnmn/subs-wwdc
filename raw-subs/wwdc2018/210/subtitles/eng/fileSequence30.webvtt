00:29:59.526 --> 00:30:00.916 A:middle
And let's see how it looks now,

00:30:01.356 --> 00:30:02.576 A:middle
using headerColor.

00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:04.606 A:middle
Looks a lot better and dark with

00:30:04.606 --> 00:30:05.446 A:middle
that dark green.

00:30:06.056 --> 00:30:07.846 A:middle
But something becomes obvious,

00:30:08.946 --> 00:30:10.116 A:middle
and that's the text.

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:13.236 A:middle
Chloe's name and age are hard to

00:30:13.236 --> 00:30:14.526 A:middle
read now against the darker

00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:14.966 A:middle
green.

00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:19.596 A:middle
Things looked okay in light, but

00:30:19.596 --> 00:30:22.276 A:middle
they don't look good in dark.

00:30:22.456 --> 00:30:24.516 A:middle
Well, there, we were using black

00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:27.236 A:middle
and dark gray, and those are

00:30:27.236 --> 00:30:28.956 A:middle
static colors, also.

00:30:29.526 --> 00:30:31.686 A:middle
Not exactly the same as

00:30:31.686 --> 00:30:33.266 A:middle
hardcoded, because we're using

00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:36.446 A:middle
available colors, but they don't

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:36.896 A:middle
change.

00:30:38.076 --> 00:30:39.766 A:middle
So, instead of using asset

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:41.206 A:middle
catalogs this time, we're going

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.906 A:middle
to take advantage of dynamic

00:30:43.906 --> 00:30:44.626 A:middle
system colors.

00:30:45.506 --> 00:30:48.416 A:middle
NSColor has many dynamic colors

00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:50.366 A:middle
available for you to use with

00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:51.766 A:middle
definitions across the different

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:52.386 A:middle
appearances.

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:55.106 A:middle
And a special thing about

00:30:55.106 --> 00:30:57.156 A:middle
NSColor is that the colors are

00:30:57.156 --> 00:30:59.476 A:middle
resolved at draw time, which

00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:01.506 A:middle
means that the actual RGBA
