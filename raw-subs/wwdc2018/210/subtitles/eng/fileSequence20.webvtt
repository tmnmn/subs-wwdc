00:19:59.856 --> 00:20:01.856 A:middle
process of creatively looking at

00:20:01.856 --> 00:20:03.516 A:middle
your glyphs and determining what

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:05.316 A:middle
areas need to be adjusted to

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:06.916 A:middle
take advantage of the Dark Mode,

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:08.856 A:middle
for example.

00:20:09.546 --> 00:20:11.876 A:middle
So, here we've got a set of our

00:20:11.996 --> 00:20:13.566 A:middle
standard glyphs that we have in

00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:14.216 A:middle
the light appearance.

00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:16.106 A:middle
One thing to note is that the

00:20:16.106 --> 00:20:17.726 A:middle
light appearances glyphs

00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:20.716 A:middle
generally use a lot of edge

00:20:20.716 --> 00:20:22.996 A:middle
strokes with hollow centers.

00:20:23.386 --> 00:20:24.406 A:middle
And the reason for that is that

00:20:24.406 --> 00:20:25.746 A:middle
we take advantage of the white

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:27.186 A:middle
backgrounds that these are

00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:29.156 A:middle
generally placed on top of in

00:20:29.156 --> 00:20:32.086 A:middle
order to denote form and shape.

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:34.826 A:middle
But, if we were to take these

00:20:34.826 --> 00:20:36.736 A:middle
exact same vector forms and

00:20:36.996 --> 00:20:38.246 A:middle
place them over a dark

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:40.196 A:middle
background, all of that sense of

00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:42.606 A:middle
form and volume is kind of lost,

00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:44.666 A:middle
and so we had to artistically

00:20:44.666 --> 00:20:46.526 A:middle
invert them to bring back some

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:47.766 A:middle
of that sense of form and

00:20:47.766 --> 00:20:48.306 A:middle
volume.

00:20:50.286 --> 00:20:51.976 A:middle
Looking at how some of these are

00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:53.916 A:middle
constructed, we've got a couple

00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:55.206 A:middle
of simple examples, like this

00:20:55.206 --> 00:20:55.606 A:middle
finder tag.

00:20:55.606 --> 00:20:58.886 A:middle
On the left side, it's denoting

00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:00.826 A:middle
a white tag with a dark eyelet
