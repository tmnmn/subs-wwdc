00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:04.126 A:middle
and add a version for the dark

00:37:04.126 --> 00:37:04.736 A:middle
appearance.

00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:10.746 A:middle
And now it looks much better

00:37:10.746 --> 00:37:13.586 A:middle
against the dark button with the

00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:14.396 A:middle
light outline.

00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:17.756 A:middle
That's great for full color

00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:18.226 A:middle
images.

00:37:18.896 --> 00:37:21.936 A:middle
How about these other two

00:37:21.936 --> 00:37:22.406 A:middle
buttons?

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:24.726 A:middle
Well, they already look pretty

00:37:24.726 --> 00:37:24.966 A:middle
good.

00:37:25.596 --> 00:37:26.726 A:middle
We didn't have to do anything,

00:37:26.726 --> 00:37:27.906 A:middle
so why?

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:28.806 A:middle
Why are these right?

00:37:29.806 --> 00:37:32.986 A:middle
Well, that's because we had made

00:37:33.176 --> 00:37:35.266 A:middle
these images template images.

00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:39.216 A:middle
To tell you a little bit about

00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:41.166 A:middle
template images, in case you

00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:42.326 A:middle
don't already know about them,

00:37:43.776 --> 00:37:45.116 A:middle
it's important to understand

00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:47.296 A:middle
that the transparency of each

00:37:47.296 --> 00:37:51.066 A:middle
pixel is maintained, but the

00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:52.036 A:middle
color is ignored.

00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:54.386 A:middle
You can make the starting image

00:37:54.386 --> 00:37:55.616 A:middle
any color you like, that's

00:37:55.616 --> 00:37:56.186 A:middle
ignored.

00:37:56.296 --> 00:37:57.556 A:middle
It's only the transparency.

00:37:58.316 --> 00:37:59.946 A:middle
They can be bitmaps or PDFs.
