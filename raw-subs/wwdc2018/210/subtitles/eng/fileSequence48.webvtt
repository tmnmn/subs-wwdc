00:47:59.516 --> 00:48:00.836 A:middle
It's a lot easier to see on top

00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:02.066 A:middle
of a more vibrant background,

00:48:02.206 --> 00:48:03.686 A:middle
such as these beautiful flower

00:48:03.686 --> 00:48:04.236 A:middle
pictures.

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:08.626 A:middle
There's three different variants

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:10.806 A:middle
that have semantics with these

00:48:10.806 --> 00:48:11.866 A:middle
background materials.

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.436 A:middle
There's the window backgrounds

00:48:13.436 --> 00:48:14.616 A:middle
that we see on the backgrounds

00:48:14.616 --> 00:48:16.596 A:middle
of generic windows; Under Page

00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.456 A:middle
Background, which appears behind

00:48:18.456 --> 00:48:19.676 A:middle
document areas such as in

00:48:19.676 --> 00:48:20.906 A:middle
Preview or Keynote.

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:23.726 A:middle
And perhaps most commonly is the

00:48:23.726 --> 00:48:25.146 A:middle
Content Background material,

00:48:25.726 --> 00:48:26.656 A:middle
which is white in light

00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:28.306 A:middle
appearance and, of course, dark

00:48:28.306 --> 00:48:29.206 A:middle
in the dark appearance.

00:48:30.166 --> 00:48:31.216 A:middle
In fact, all of these are now

00:48:31.216 --> 00:48:32.676 A:middle
dark in the dark appearance but

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.306 A:middle
also have that wallpaper tinting

00:48:34.366 --> 00:48:36.866 A:middle
effect.

00:48:36.866 --> 00:48:37.766 A:middle
The great news is that it's

00:48:37.816 --> 00:48:38.956 A:middle
really not hard to get these

00:48:38.956 --> 00:48:39.546 A:middle
effects.

00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:41.086 A:middle
For the most part, it comes

00:48:41.086 --> 00:48:42.396 A:middle
completely automatically by

00:48:42.396 --> 00:48:43.496 A:middle
using system views.

00:48:43.496 --> 00:48:45.076 A:middle
For instance, the default

00:48:45.076 --> 00:48:47.016 A:middle
backgrounds of every window has

00:48:47.016 --> 00:48:48.396 A:middle
that window background material

00:48:48.556 --> 00:48:49.116 A:middle
built right in.

00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:52.336 A:middle
In addition, [inaudible] views

00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:54.946 A:middle
such as NSCollectionView or

00:48:54.946 --> 00:48:57.016 A:middle
NSTableView also automatically

00:48:57.016 --> 00:48:58.246 A:middle
come with the content background

00:48:58.246 --> 00:48:59.516 A:middle
material built right in.
