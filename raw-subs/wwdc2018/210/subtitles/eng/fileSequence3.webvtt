00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.386 A:middle
Aside from Dark Mode, another

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:02.866 A:middle
new interface feature that we

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.966 A:middle
added into macOS 10.14 are

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:05.866 A:middle
accent colors.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.036 A:middle
Previous releases of macOS

00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.376 A:middle
offered two accent colors, blue

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.196 A:middle
and graphite, but for macOS

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:13.876 A:middle
10.14, we've expanded the color

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:15.266 A:middle
palette to include eight fun

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.556 A:middle
colors to really help you

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:18.756 A:middle
personalize your Mac.

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:20.926 A:middle
So, if you're like me and you

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:22.556 A:middle
love the color red, you're going

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.696 A:middle
to immediately switch over to

00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:25.596 A:middle
the color red [laughs].

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:30.016 A:middle
If orange or yellow are more of

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:31.456 A:middle
your preference, you're going to

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:32.286 A:middle
switch over to those, and we

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.316 A:middle
make those available as well.

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:38.256 A:middle
I should note that the accent

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:39.336 A:middle
colors are not just a

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.376 A:middle
sub-feature of Dark Mode, but

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:42.626 A:middle
they're also available in Light

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:42.896 A:middle
Mode.

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:44.986 A:middle
So if you prefer Light Mode but

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:46.626 A:middle
want green accent color, you can

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:47.316 A:middle
do that as well.

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:50.316 A:middle
So, now that we've covered a

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:51.856 A:middle
little bit of the basics of what

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:53.896 A:middle
Dark Mode is and what accent

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.616 A:middle
colors are also, let's dive a

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:56.696 A:middle
little bit deeper into some of

00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:58.006 A:middle
the design principles that went

00:03:58.006 --> 00:03:58.806 A:middle
into Dark Mode.

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.686 A:middle
At Apple, when we begin a new
