00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:01.256 A:middle
colors in asset catalogs.

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:03.266 A:middle
You've been able to do this

00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:05.476 A:middle
since 10.13-- have colors in

00:29:05.476 --> 00:29:08.196 A:middle
asset catalogs, but now you can

00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:09.726 A:middle
specify colors for different

00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:10.356 A:middle
appearances.

00:29:10.906 --> 00:29:12.746 A:middle
So, we've added a dark version

00:29:13.026 --> 00:29:13.976 A:middle
of our header color.

00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:16.456 A:middle
Asset catalog colors have

00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:17.716 A:middle
several advantages.

00:29:18.396 --> 00:29:20.976 A:middle
You can give them meaningful

00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:23.136 A:middle
names that describe where the

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.886 A:middle
color is used or how it is used,

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:25.876 A:middle
and those are often called

00:29:25.876 --> 00:29:27.176 A:middle
semantic names.

00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:31.106 A:middle
You can have multiple

00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:32.676 A:middle
definitions of the color, as I

00:29:32.676 --> 00:29:33.906 A:middle
showed you, with the light and

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:35.906 A:middle
dark versions and also for

00:29:35.906 --> 00:29:38.476 A:middle
different color spaces-- sRGB

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:38.846 A:middle
versus P3.

00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:42.076 A:middle
And it gives you a central

00:29:42.076 --> 00:29:44.256 A:middle
location for defining all of

00:29:44.256 --> 00:29:44.886 A:middle
your colors.

00:29:45.206 --> 00:29:46.686 A:middle
That makes it easy to go in and

00:29:46.686 --> 00:29:47.806 A:middle
tweak your colors without

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:49.926 A:middle
changing any code if needed.

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:54.116 A:middle
So, here's our color now in a

00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:56.296 A:middle
asset catalog, and it's called

00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:57.656 A:middle
headerColor, because it's the

00:29:57.656 --> 00:29:58.286 A:middle
header color.

00:29:59.526 --> 00:30:00.916 A:middle
And let's see how it looks now,
