00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.306 A:middle
contrast light and high contrast

00:36:00.306 --> 00:36:00.586 A:middle
dark.

00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:04.526 A:middle
And this is how Chameleon

00:36:04.526 --> 00:36:06.786 A:middle
Wrangler now looks in the dark

00:36:06.786 --> 00:36:08.226 A:middle
high contrast appearance.

00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:10.276 A:middle
You'll notice that not only is

00:36:10.276 --> 00:36:11.666 A:middle
my header color using that

00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:13.246 A:middle
special color that I defined,

00:36:13.856 --> 00:36:15.386 A:middle
the rest of the system colors

00:36:15.466 --> 00:36:17.586 A:middle
are also specially defined for

00:36:17.586 --> 00:36:19.106 A:middle
the high contrast appearances.

00:36:19.936 --> 00:36:22.256 A:middle
And this is true for light high

00:36:22.256 --> 00:36:23.486 A:middle
contrast, as well.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:28.156 A:middle
Now I'd like to move along and

00:36:28.226 --> 00:36:29.206 A:middle
talk about images.

00:36:34.466 --> 00:36:36.426 A:middle
We'll take a look at the toolbar

00:36:36.426 --> 00:36:37.156 A:middle
buttons here.

00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:42.286 A:middle
This chameleon color picker

00:36:42.286 --> 00:36:44.666 A:middle
button looks pretty good in

00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:46.976 A:middle
light, but in dark, that dark

00:36:46.976 --> 00:36:48.746 A:middle
outline disappears against the

00:36:48.746 --> 00:36:50.026 A:middle
dark background of the button.

00:36:51.226 --> 00:36:54.496 A:middle
So, we'd like to have a special

00:36:54.496 --> 00:36:56.026 A:middle
version of it for the dark

00:36:56.066 --> 00:36:58.046 A:middle
appearance, and, once again, we

00:36:58.046 --> 00:36:59.866 A:middle
turn to our asset catalog friend
