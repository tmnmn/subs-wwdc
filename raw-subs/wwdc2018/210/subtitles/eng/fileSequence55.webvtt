00:54:59.506 --> 00:55:00.176 A:middle
something like that.

00:55:00.596 --> 00:55:01.966 A:middle
And all of the text and images

00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:03.646 A:middle
within that also get that dark

00:55:03.646 --> 00:55:05.946 A:middle
styling, but we can also use

00:55:05.946 --> 00:55:07.356 A:middle
this to fix the problem we had

00:55:07.356 --> 00:55:08.916 A:middle
before with our text area.

00:55:09.876 --> 00:55:11.786 A:middle
We can see here that we actually

00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:13.316 A:middle
want this entire document area

00:55:13.386 --> 00:55:14.486 A:middle
to remain having a light

00:55:14.486 --> 00:55:16.086 A:middle
appearance, and so by setting

00:55:16.086 --> 00:55:17.536 A:middle
the lightAqua appearance, we can

00:55:17.536 --> 00:55:18.406 A:middle
make sure that the text

00:55:18.406 --> 00:55:19.826 A:middle
highlighting color gets the

00:55:19.826 --> 00:55:21.426 A:middle
correct appearance as well as

00:55:21.426 --> 00:55:22.466 A:middle
the autocorrect bubble

00:55:22.676 --> 00:55:24.196 A:middle
inheriting that light appearance

00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:24.556 A:middle
as well.

00:55:26.606 --> 00:55:27.546 A:middle
However, in addition to be able

00:55:27.546 --> 00:55:28.756 A:middle
to be used for some really cool

00:55:28.756 --> 00:55:30.426 A:middle
effects, it can also lead to

00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:31.966 A:middle
some hard-to-debug situations.

00:55:31.966 --> 00:55:34.386 A:middle
For instance, here, we're using

00:55:34.386 --> 00:55:35.336 A:middle
the vibrantLight appearance

00:55:35.336 --> 00:55:36.656 A:middle
explicitly on our table view,

00:55:36.656 --> 00:55:38.546 A:middle
and that looks perfectly fine in

00:55:38.546 --> 00:55:39.786 A:middle
the light appearance, where it's

00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:41.366 A:middle
actually already inheriting the

00:55:41.366 --> 00:55:43.546 A:middle
vibrantLight appearance.

00:55:43.546 --> 00:55:44.806 A:middle
In Dark Mode, this quickly

00:55:44.806 --> 00:55:46.586 A:middle
becomes a very visible problem.

00:55:47.226 --> 00:55:48.426 A:middle
We can see that the text and

00:55:48.426 --> 00:55:49.866 A:middle
images inside that table view

00:55:49.866 --> 00:55:50.876 A:middle
are now inheriting that

00:55:50.876 --> 00:55:52.636 A:middle
vibrantLight appearance and look

00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:53.936 A:middle
bad on top of that dark

00:55:53.936 --> 00:55:54.356 A:middle
background.

00:55:54.356 --> 00:55:56.386 A:middle
So, for the most part, we just

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.516 A:middle
want to remove these explicit

00:55:57.516 --> 00:55:59.126 A:middle
overrides in places where we

00:55:59.186 --> 00:56:00.776 A:middle
really do not intend to have an
