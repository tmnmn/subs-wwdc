00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:05.686 A:middle
The interface shares a lot of

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:07.166 A:middle
family resemblances between the

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.496 A:middle
light appearance and the dark

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:09.846 A:middle
appearance, and that is because

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.246 A:middle
we wanted to encourage users to

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:13.066 A:middle
switch between both appearances

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:16.116 A:middle
easily and find the one that

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:17.386 A:middle
really best suits their needs.

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:18.896 A:middle
And so it was very important

00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:19.876 A:middle
that things like control

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:22.216 A:middle
metrics, window layout, and the

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.186 A:middle
distribution of translucent

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.826 A:middle
materials be the same as much as

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:26.746 A:middle
possible between both

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.436 A:middle
appearances.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:30.056 A:middle
As such it's also equally

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:31.166 A:middle
important that all of your

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.446 A:middle
applications take full advantage

00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:35.316 A:middle
of both appearances so that they

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:37.156 A:middle
update correctly between both

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.996 A:middle
appearances no matter what the

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:40.716 A:middle
system is running under.

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:41.796 A:middle
You really don't want to be that

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:42.956 A:middle
one light appearance that's

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:46.066 A:middle
stuck in dark appearance.

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:47.656 A:middle
All in all, we're super happy

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:49.226 A:middle
with how the design turned out,

00:02:49.226 --> 00:02:51.196 A:middle
and we are really anxious to see

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:53.286 A:middle
what you guys are going to turn

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:54.576 A:middle
your apps into as soon as you

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:55.796 A:middle
get hands on the developer beta

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:56.896 A:middle
and start adopting the Dark

00:02:56.896 --> 00:02:57.136 A:middle
Mode.

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.386 A:middle
Aside from Dark Mode, another
