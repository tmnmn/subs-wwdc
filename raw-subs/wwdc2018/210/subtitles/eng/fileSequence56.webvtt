00:55:59.186 --> 00:56:00.776 A:middle
really do not intend to have an

00:56:00.776 --> 00:56:01.986 A:middle
always light appearance.

00:56:03.426 --> 00:56:04.416 A:middle
This can also happen in

00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:06.116 A:middle
Interface Builder, where, at the

00:56:06.116 --> 00:56:07.606 A:middle
very bottom of the Attributes

00:56:07.606 --> 00:56:09.196 A:middle
Inspector, we've accidentally

00:56:09.196 --> 00:56:11.006 A:middle
overridden the appearance for

00:56:11.156 --> 00:56:12.656 A:middle
our outline view to always be

00:56:12.656 --> 00:56:14.696 A:middle
the light Aqua appearance.

00:56:14.696 --> 00:56:15.856 A:middle
Here, the fix is simply to

00:56:15.856 --> 00:56:18.796 A:middle
change it back to the inherited

00:56:18.796 --> 00:56:20.196 A:middle
style so that it can make sure

00:56:20.196 --> 00:56:21.786 A:middle
to follow Dark Mode when that's

00:56:21.786 --> 00:56:23.786 A:middle
turned on, so do be sure to

00:56:23.786 --> 00:56:24.736 A:middle
check for all of those.

00:56:26.176 --> 00:56:28.476 A:middle
At this point, Chameleon

00:56:28.476 --> 00:56:29.956 A:middle
Wrangler's looking really great

00:56:29.956 --> 00:56:30.686 A:middle
in Dark Mode.

00:56:31.896 --> 00:56:33.226 A:middle
But kind of an understated thing

00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:35.546 A:middle
here is that, at this point,

00:56:35.686 --> 00:56:37.366 A:middle
we've written 0 lines of code

00:56:37.566 --> 00:56:38.876 A:middle
specific to Dark Mode.

00:56:40.116 --> 00:56:41.436 A:middle
The types of changes necessary

00:56:41.436 --> 00:56:42.556 A:middle
for being a great Dark Mode

00:56:42.556 --> 00:56:44.706 A:middle
citizen is that you need to make

00:56:44.706 --> 00:56:46.756 A:middle
sure to express the ideas

00:56:46.756 --> 00:56:48.556 A:middle
semantically rather than

00:56:48.556 --> 00:56:49.006 A:middle
literally.

00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:52.926 A:middle
So, for instance, these same

00:56:52.926 --> 00:56:54.156 A:middle
sets of changes allowed our

00:56:54.156 --> 00:56:56.686 A:middle
application to not only look

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.966 A:middle
great in Dark Mode but also in

00:56:58.966 --> 00:57:00.386 A:middle
the light appearance.
