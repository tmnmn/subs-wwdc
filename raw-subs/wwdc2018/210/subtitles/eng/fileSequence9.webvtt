00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
shadows and saw what changes we

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:04.066 A:middle
needed to do for those, and the

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:05.176 A:middle
changes that we did for Dark

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:06.696 A:middle
Mode where we adjusted the

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:07.826 A:middle
opacity to make them a little

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:09.816 A:middle
bit higher so that the contrast

00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:12.086 A:middle
edge was more defined and that

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.236 A:middle
we made them a little bit

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:13.676 A:middle
crisper.

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:18.866 A:middle
To further the focus and the

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:20.886 A:middle
edge detail on the windows, we

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:24.026 A:middle
added an inner rim stroke to the

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:26.476 A:middle
windows to really help define

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:28.646 A:middle
the windows and pop them off.

00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:30.306 A:middle
The end result is that the

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:32.606 A:middle
visual cue still looks very

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.406 A:middle
similar to the light appearance,

00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:37.366 A:middle
but the end result has been

00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:39.196 A:middle
finely tuned for dark appearance

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:40.906 A:middle
so that it works much better.

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:47.926 A:middle
The second principle was that

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.276 A:middle
Dark Mode is content focused,

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.166 A:middle
and this was the one that we

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:51.676 A:middle
referred back to the most often

00:09:51.676 --> 00:09:52.826 A:middle
throughout the entire process,

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:53.246 A:middle
actually.

00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:56.896 A:middle
When you look at a light

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.066 A:middle
interface screen, it can

00:09:58.066 --> 00:09:59.226 A:middle
sometimes be a little difficult

00:09:59.226 --> 00:10:01.396 A:middle
to tell what the content is,
