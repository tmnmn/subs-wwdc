00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:01.776 A:middle
All of these effects are further

00:42:01.776 --> 00:42:03.306 A:middle
customized for the increased

00:42:03.306 --> 00:42:06.266 A:middle
contrast setting without any

00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:07.566 A:middle
changes from our application.

00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:09.446 A:middle
So, it's really great that we

00:42:09.446 --> 00:42:11.156 A:middle
didn't have to specify all 12 of

00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:11.936 A:middle
these colors.

00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:13.226 A:middle
And instead, we specified a

00:42:13.226 --> 00:42:14.786 A:middle
single one and, thanks to

00:42:14.786 --> 00:42:16.046 A:middle
dynamic system colors and

00:42:16.046 --> 00:42:17.766 A:middle
dynamic system effects, we got

00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:18.936 A:middle
all of this completely

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:19.586 A:middle
automatically.

00:42:21.896 --> 00:42:23.616 A:middle
So, our Moodometer is looking

00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:23.956 A:middle
great.

00:42:24.736 --> 00:42:25.946 A:middle
Next, we can step over to

00:42:25.946 --> 00:42:27.356 A:middle
another type of app where we

00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:28.646 A:middle
keep track of very important

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.506 A:middle
information about Chloe, such as

00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:32.166 A:middle
how stressed she's feeling or

00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:33.436 A:middle
more importantly, what's her

00:42:33.436 --> 00:42:34.386 A:middle
favorite type of berry?

00:42:35.476 --> 00:42:36.926 A:middle
We can see here that this

00:42:36.926 --> 00:42:38.226 A:middle
already looks great, because we

00:42:38.226 --> 00:42:40.916 A:middle
are using stock Cocoa controls,

00:42:41.096 --> 00:42:42.446 A:middle
which automatically adjust for

00:42:42.446 --> 00:42:43.006 A:middle
Dark Mode.

00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:46.206 A:middle
We can see how it reacts to the

00:42:46.266 --> 00:42:47.256 A:middle
accent color feature that

00:42:47.256 --> 00:42:48.896 A:middle
Raymond talked about by opening

00:42:48.896 --> 00:42:50.876 A:middle
up system preferences, changing

00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:52.336 A:middle
the color to a nice chameleon

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.216 A:middle
striped yellow, and returning

00:42:54.216 --> 00:42:55.466 A:middle
back to Chameleon Wrangler.

00:42:56.596 --> 00:42:57.666 A:middle
We can, again, see that the

00:42:57.666 --> 00:42:59.436 A:middle
built-in controls automatically

00:42:59.436 --> 00:43:00.886 A:middle
adjust to that yellow accent
