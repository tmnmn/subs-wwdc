00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.086 A:middle
images with a lighter color.

00:40:02.336 --> 00:40:03.646 A:middle
However, it's kind of

00:40:03.646 --> 00:40:05.016 A:middle
unfortunate that we're only

00:40:05.016 --> 00:40:06.296 A:middle
varying the fill color of these

00:40:06.296 --> 00:40:07.806 A:middle
images but keeping the same

00:40:07.806 --> 00:40:08.136 A:middle
shape.

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.206 A:middle
So, there's probably a better

00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:13.016 A:middle
way, and, in Mojave, there is,

00:40:13.156 --> 00:40:14.936 A:middle
using this contentTintColor API.

00:40:15.976 --> 00:40:17.826 A:middle
With this, you can create a

00:40:17.826 --> 00:40:19.566 A:middle
template image and provide a

00:40:19.566 --> 00:40:21.106 A:middle
custom tint color to be used

00:40:21.106 --> 00:40:21.946 A:middle
instead of the default

00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:22.906 A:middle
appearance sensitive one.

00:40:23.226 --> 00:40:24.666 A:middle
That will be used as the base

00:40:24.666 --> 00:40:26.476 A:middle
fill color for any of the places

00:40:26.476 --> 00:40:27.716 A:middle
that the image appears.

00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:30.416 A:middle
So, we can set the content tint

00:40:30.416 --> 00:40:32.326 A:middle
color on an NSImageView to tint

00:40:32.426 --> 00:40:34.786 A:middle
its image or on an NSButton to

00:40:34.786 --> 00:40:36.316 A:middle
tint both its boot image and

00:40:36.316 --> 00:40:36.616 A:middle
title.

00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:39.226 A:middle
So, let's take a look at

00:40:39.226 --> 00:40:40.026 A:middle
adopting this.

00:40:40.426 --> 00:40:41.486 A:middle
The first step here is to

00:40:41.486 --> 00:40:42.976 A:middle
convert these to simple template

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:45.026 A:middle
images and remember to set the

00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:46.896 A:middle
render mode to be the template

00:40:46.896 --> 00:40:47.306 A:middle
effect.

00:40:48.496 --> 00:40:49.426 A:middle
Taking a look at Chameleon

00:40:49.426 --> 00:40:50.816 A:middle
Wrangler now, we can see that

00:40:50.816 --> 00:40:52.316 A:middle
these images are now getting the

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:53.906 A:middle
default templating effect, which

00:40:53.906 --> 00:40:55.786 A:middle
looks great in Dark Mode, but

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:56.896 A:middle
the next step is going to be

00:40:56.896 --> 00:40:57.926 A:middle
applying that color.

00:40:58.396 --> 00:41:00.426 A:middle
So, we could just pull the color
