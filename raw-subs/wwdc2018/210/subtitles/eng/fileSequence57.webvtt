00:56:58.966 --> 00:57:00.386 A:middle
the light appearance.

00:57:00.786 --> 00:57:01.976 A:middle
Adding support for things like

00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:03.416 A:middle
the accent color as well as

00:57:03.416 --> 00:57:04.616 A:middle
making our label colors more

00:57:04.616 --> 00:57:05.756 A:middle
consistent with the rest of the

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:06.146 A:middle
system.

00:57:07.436 --> 00:57:09.246 A:middle
Further, these same sets of

00:57:09.246 --> 00:57:11.196 A:middle
changes needed to be great in

00:57:11.196 --> 00:57:13.446 A:middle
Dark Mode are also the same sets

00:57:13.446 --> 00:57:15.146 A:middle
of changes needed to have great

00:57:15.146 --> 00:57:16.906 A:middle
support for the high contrast

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.056 A:middle
accessibility setting.

00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:20.916 A:middle
So, to reiterate what those

00:57:20.916 --> 00:57:22.436 A:middle
steps were, the first and

00:57:22.436 --> 00:57:24.166 A:middle
foremost was linking on the

00:57:24.166 --> 00:57:27.636 A:middle
10.14 SDK using Xcode 10.

00:57:27.636 --> 00:57:29.536 A:middle
For a handful of apps that

00:57:29.536 --> 00:57:30.966 A:middle
already use system controls and

00:57:30.966 --> 00:57:32.986 A:middle
system colors, this is the only

00:57:32.986 --> 00:57:34.026 A:middle
step that's going to be needed,

00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:35.476 A:middle
and it's already going to look

00:57:35.476 --> 00:57:36.306 A:middle
great in Dark Mode.

00:57:36.846 --> 00:57:38.646 A:middle
For the rest of us, the next

00:57:38.646 --> 00:57:40.536 A:middle
step is to audit our app for the

00:57:40.536 --> 00:57:42.056 A:middle
use of static colors,

00:57:42.736 --> 00:57:44.506 A:middle
non-template images, and

00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:46.376 A:middle
nonsemantic materials, and

00:57:46.376 --> 00:57:47.526 A:middle
replace those as appropriate.

00:57:47.526 --> 00:57:49.396 A:middle
For instance, this might be

00:57:49.396 --> 00:57:51.276 A:middle
using a system color, a semantic

00:57:51.276 --> 00:57:53.216 A:middle
material, or, in some cases,

00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:54.686 A:middle
defining a custom asset catalog

00:57:54.686 --> 00:57:55.686 A:middle
color or image.

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.416 A:middle
And, again, it's important to

00:57:57.416 --> 00:57:58.326 A:middle
keep an eye out for those

00:57:58.326 --> 00:58:00.216 A:middle
accidental appearance overrides.
