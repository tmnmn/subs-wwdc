00:53:59.546 --> 00:54:00.536 A:middle
So, in general, this is the

00:54:00.536 --> 00:54:01.506 A:middle
system preference.

00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:02.926 A:middle
Some of you maybe already have a

00:54:02.926 --> 00:54:04.086 A:middle
dark theme for your application

00:54:04.086 --> 00:54:05.476 A:middle
controlled via app preference,

00:54:05.526 --> 00:54:06.796 A:middle
so your first step would be to

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:07.916 A:middle
tie that back to the system

00:54:07.916 --> 00:54:10.156 A:middle
preference so the people using

00:54:10.156 --> 00:54:11.426 A:middle
the system can have a consistent

00:54:11.426 --> 00:54:12.786 A:middle
experience.

00:54:13.366 --> 00:54:15.056 A:middle
And in some ambiguous cases like

00:54:15.056 --> 00:54:16.286 A:middle
Raymond mentioned, there may be

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.356 A:middle
some additional need for an

00:54:17.356 --> 00:54:18.566 A:middle
in-app preference, such as in

00:54:18.566 --> 00:54:20.296 A:middle
the mail case, but for the most

00:54:20.296 --> 00:54:21.606 A:middle
part, the system preference

00:54:21.606 --> 00:54:23.456 A:middle
should be exactly what users go

00:54:23.456 --> 00:54:23.706 A:middle
for.

00:54:23.706 --> 00:54:26.466 A:middle
If you do decide you need to

00:54:26.516 --> 00:54:27.876 A:middle
have an always dark application,

00:54:28.096 --> 00:54:29.276 A:middle
it's really important to not to

00:54:29.276 --> 00:54:30.486 A:middle
use the Vibrant Dark appearance

00:54:30.486 --> 00:54:31.926 A:middle
on the entire window, because

00:54:31.926 --> 00:54:33.196 A:middle
that's not appropriate for the

00:54:33.196 --> 00:54:35.416 A:middle
opaque window areas of the

00:54:35.416 --> 00:54:37.136 A:middle
application and are really only

00:54:37.136 --> 00:54:38.266 A:middle
intended for sidebars.

00:54:39.316 --> 00:54:40.226 A:middle
Instead, you want to use the

00:54:40.226 --> 00:54:41.866 A:middle
Dark Aqua appearance if you want

00:54:41.866 --> 00:54:43.746 A:middle
to have that always dark look.

00:54:44.596 --> 00:54:46.096 A:middle
In addition to be able to be set

00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:47.626 A:middle
on the window as a whole, you

00:54:47.626 --> 00:54:49.046 A:middle
can also set it on an individual

00:54:49.046 --> 00:54:50.276 A:middle
window or view scoping, and

00:54:50.626 --> 00:54:51.826 A:middle
that's inherited by all of the

00:54:51.866 --> 00:54:52.856 A:middle
views contained within it.

00:54:53.626 --> 00:54:55.086 A:middle
For instance, here, we're

00:54:55.086 --> 00:54:56.506 A:middle
setting the sidebar to always

00:54:56.506 --> 00:54:58.736 A:middle
have the darkAqua appearance if

00:54:58.736 --> 00:54:59.506 A:middle
we want to experiment with

00:54:59.506 --> 00:55:00.176 A:middle
something like that.
