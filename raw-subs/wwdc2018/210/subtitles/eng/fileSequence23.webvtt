00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.736 A:middle
Again, generally, the process of

00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:03.436 A:middle
construction for this one is

00:23:03.436 --> 00:23:04.406 A:middle
about the same as some of the

00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:06.706 A:middle
other ones, but it's a little

00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:10.246 A:middle
bit more detailed and time

00:23:10.246 --> 00:23:12.066 A:middle
consuming just due to the number

00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:13.106 A:middle
of paths that there are.

00:23:13.196 --> 00:23:14.866 A:middle
But, generally, what you want to

00:23:14.866 --> 00:23:16.116 A:middle
do is break it apart into two

00:23:16.116 --> 00:23:17.816 A:middle
pieces, again, so that you have

00:23:17.816 --> 00:23:19.256 A:middle
the front and the rear portion,

00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:20.936 A:middle
and then you have your letter

00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:21.956 A:middle
portion in between.

00:23:22.616 --> 00:23:24.636 A:middle
One important detail that this

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:29.026 A:middle
glyph exemplifies is the dual

00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:30.756 A:middle
opacities that we use in some of

00:23:30.756 --> 00:23:31.146 A:middle
our glyphs.

00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:32.696 A:middle
In this case, the letter is set

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:35.536 A:middle
to 80% opacity in order to make

00:23:35.536 --> 00:23:36.956 A:middle
it secondary to the envelope,

00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:38.316 A:middle
itself, being opened, which is

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:38.876 A:middle
what we're trying to

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:39.486 A:middle
communicate.

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:42.026 A:middle
And the opposite is true in

00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:43.756 A:middle
Light Mode also, where we do use

00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:45.906 A:middle
80% opacities, in some cases,

00:23:45.906 --> 00:23:46.406 A:middle
also.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:50.796 A:middle
So, quickly wrapping up what

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.846 A:middle
we've covered so far.

00:23:52.906 --> 00:23:55.646 A:middle
Dark interfaces are cool, so

00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:56.876 A:middle
cool that you're probably going

00:23:56.876 --> 00:23:57.986 A:middle
to want to make your app

00:23:58.386 --> 00:23:59.886 A:middle
potentially dark all the time,

00:23:59.946 --> 00:24:01.016 A:middle
but unless your app is a
