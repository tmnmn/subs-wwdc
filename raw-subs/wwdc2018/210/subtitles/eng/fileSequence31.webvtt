00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:01.506 A:middle
means that the actual RGBA

00:31:01.746 --> 00:31:04.596 A:middle
values that are used depend on

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:06.286 A:middle
the circumstances at the time

00:31:06.556 --> 00:31:07.366 A:middle
that the color is drawn.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.976 A:middle
I'm going to go through some

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:11.996 A:middle
examples of dynamic system

00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:12.636 A:middle
colors now.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:15.766 A:middle
Starting with the label colors

00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:16.856 A:middle
that Raymond talked about

00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:19.806 A:middle
earlier, and I'm showing the

00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:21.586 A:middle
dynamic colors on the top half

00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:23.576 A:middle
and some corresponding static

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:25.076 A:middle
colors just using black in

00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:26.606 A:middle
varying levels of opacity on the

00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:27.306 A:middle
bottom half.

00:31:27.966 --> 00:31:29.716 A:middle
And, as you can see, in the

00:31:29.716 --> 00:31:31.026 A:middle
light appearance, everything

00:31:31.026 --> 00:31:31.736 A:middle
looks fine.

00:31:32.436 --> 00:31:34.626 A:middle
But over in dark, labelColor

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.466 A:middle
looks great still, but the black

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:37.676 A:middle
colors disappear against the

00:31:37.676 --> 00:31:38.456 A:middle
dark background.

00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:42.856 A:middle
Here's an example in the system

00:31:42.856 --> 00:31:45.326 A:middle
in Mail of where labelColor and

00:31:45.326 --> 00:31:47.586 A:middle
secondaryLabelColor are used.

00:31:48.626 --> 00:31:50.396 A:middle
The more important text is given

00:31:50.396 --> 00:31:51.856 A:middle
the labelColor, and the less

00:31:51.856 --> 00:31:53.436 A:middle
important text is

00:31:53.436 --> 00:31:54.496 A:middle
secondaryLabelColor.

00:31:55.196 --> 00:31:59.006 A:middle
To find out which colors are

00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:01.296 A:middle
dynamic, in the Interface
