00:44:59.586 --> 00:45:01.076 A:middle
this photo browser where we draw

00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:02.406 A:middle
a selection ring around the

00:45:02.406 --> 00:45:03.816 A:middle
selected photo.

00:45:04.356 --> 00:45:06.126 A:middle
Here, we were using the

00:45:06.226 --> 00:45:08.026 A:middle
selectedContentBackgroundColor,

00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:09.576 A:middle
and that, again, automatically

00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:11.066 A:middle
adjusts based on the user's

00:45:11.066 --> 00:45:12.056 A:middle
selected accent.

00:45:13.846 --> 00:45:14.696 A:middle
Let's open up one of these

00:45:14.696 --> 00:45:15.986 A:middle
photos and take a look at a

00:45:15.986 --> 00:45:17.956 A:middle
nice, big, beautiful photo of

00:45:17.956 --> 00:45:18.336 A:middle
Chloe.

00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:21.396 A:middle
The first thing that stands out

00:45:21.396 --> 00:45:22.636 A:middle
is the fact that the background

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.436 A:middle
has not adjusted for Dark Mode.

00:45:25.066 --> 00:45:26.276 A:middle
It's still using its light

00:45:26.276 --> 00:45:28.256 A:middle
translucency effect similar to a

00:45:28.256 --> 00:45:29.106 A:middle
hardcoded color.

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:32.066 A:middle
This effect is provided by

00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:33.896 A:middle
NSVisualEfffectView, which

00:45:33.926 --> 00:45:35.246 A:middle
provides the translucent blur

00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:36.616 A:middle
materials you see across the

00:45:36.616 --> 00:45:37.026 A:middle
system.

00:45:37.186 --> 00:45:38.766 A:middle
For instance, there's the

00:45:38.766 --> 00:45:40.236 A:middle
sidebars which blur onto the

00:45:40.236 --> 00:45:41.736 A:middle
desktop and other windows behind

00:45:41.736 --> 00:45:43.446 A:middle
it, as well as things like the

00:45:43.446 --> 00:45:44.886 A:middle
title bar, which blur the

00:45:44.886 --> 00:45:45.886 A:middle
content that's scrolled

00:45:45.886 --> 00:45:47.066 A:middle
underneath.

00:45:47.966 --> 00:45:50.226 A:middle
NSVisualEffectView also enables

00:45:50.226 --> 00:45:51.566 A:middle
the vibrant foreground blending,

00:45:51.866 --> 00:45:53.636 A:middle
that Raymond talked about, by

00:45:53.636 --> 00:45:55.586 A:middle
taking a grayscale color plus a

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.206 A:middle
Blend Mode and making it really

00:45:57.206 --> 00:45:58.846 A:middle
pop on top of these backgrounds.

00:45:59.826 --> 00:46:00.906 A:middle
