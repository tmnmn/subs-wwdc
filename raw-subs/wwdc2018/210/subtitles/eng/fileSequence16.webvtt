user to another area of your

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:01.566 A:middle
application-- those should be

00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:02.526 A:middle
treated with linkColor.

00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:04.816 A:middle
ControlAccentColor and

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:06.696 A:middle
systemBlueColor are really meant

00:16:06.696 --> 00:16:09.136 A:middle
to be used on controls that have

00:16:09.196 --> 00:16:10.896 A:middle
visible borders or button bezel

00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:13.496 A:middle
backgrounds or for tinted

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:13.856 A:middle
glyphs.

00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:16.516 A:middle
ControlAccentColor, as the name

00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:19.416 A:middle
implies, is going to respond to

00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:21.296 A:middle
whatever the system accent color

00:16:21.296 --> 00:16:22.866 A:middle
is set to, in this case, red.

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.026 A:middle
So, if you have a custom control

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.186 A:middle
that is trying to mimic the

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:28.086 A:middle
appearance of a standard system

00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:29.886 A:middle
control, or you just have a

00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:31.196 A:middle
control that you would like to

00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:32.476 A:middle
follow suit with whatever the

00:16:32.516 --> 00:16:34.486 A:middle
system appearance is set to, you

00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:35.896 A:middle
should use controlAccentColor.

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:38.036 A:middle
If you have a control where it's

00:16:38.036 --> 00:16:39.386 A:middle
important that the control stays

00:16:39.386 --> 00:16:41.646 A:middle
blue because of informational

00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:43.076 A:middle
purposes or for branding

00:16:43.076 --> 00:16:45.506 A:middle
purposes, then systemBlueColor

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:46.516 A:middle
is a better choice for you to

00:16:46.516 --> 00:16:46.846 A:middle
use.

00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:50.286 A:middle
Next, let's take a look at

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:51.336 A:middle
designing with vibrancy.

00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:54.926 A:middle
When we talk about vibrancy,

00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:56.036 A:middle
what we're generally referring

00:16:56.036 --> 00:16:58.066 A:middle
to is the package of a

00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:00.356 A:middle
translucent material working in
