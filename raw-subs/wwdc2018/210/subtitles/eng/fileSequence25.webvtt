00:24:58.986 --> 00:25:02.026 A:middle
generally, you want to make sure

00:25:02.026 --> 00:25:03.526 A:middle
that you're using the three

00:25:03.526 --> 00:25:04.666 A:middle
colors that we went over,

00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:05.786 A:middle
appropriately, if you have

00:25:05.876 --> 00:25:07.956 A:middle
controls that are text controls,

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:11.026 A:middle
try using text link if it's

00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:11.806 A:middle
applicable.

00:25:12.306 --> 00:25:13.746 A:middle
If you have controls that you

00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:16.176 A:middle
want to follow the system accent

00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:18.746 A:middle
color appearance, set those to

00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:20.736 A:middle
control accent color, and if you

00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:21.866 A:middle
have a control that has to stay

00:25:21.866 --> 00:25:24.626 A:middle
blue all the time, adopt system

00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:25.756 A:middle
blue color.

00:25:25.756 --> 00:25:27.976 A:middle
And then Taylor and Rachel are

00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:29.576 A:middle
going to go into a lot more

00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:30.986 A:middle
detail about color uses, so

00:25:31.236 --> 00:25:32.916 A:middle
definitely pay attention to

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:33.986 A:middle
their section.

00:25:34.646 --> 00:25:37.686 A:middle
When constructing your vibrancy

00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:39.226 A:middle
areas, make sure that you're

00:25:39.226 --> 00:25:40.856 A:middle
constructing them in a way that

00:25:40.856 --> 00:25:42.186 A:middle
takes full advantage of the

00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:44.046 A:middle
vibrant effect blending, so make

00:25:44.046 --> 00:25:45.206 A:middle
sure that you're using grayscale

00:25:45.206 --> 00:25:46.236 A:middle
colors that are opaque.

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:47.966 A:middle
And if you have areas that need

00:25:47.966 --> 00:25:50.066 A:middle
to be knockouts or have

00:25:50.066 --> 00:25:52.646 A:middle
opacities, ramp towards black in

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:54.246 A:middle
Dark Mode or ramp towards white

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:55.026 A:middle
in Light Mode.

00:25:56.476 --> 00:26:00.056 A:middle
And then, lastly, make sure that
