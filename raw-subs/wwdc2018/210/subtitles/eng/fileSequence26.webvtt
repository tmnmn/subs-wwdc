And then, lastly, make sure that

00:26:00.056 --> 00:26:01.666 A:middle
the glyphs that you're using are

00:26:01.736 --> 00:26:03.666 A:middle
artistically inverted in order

00:26:03.746 --> 00:26:07.386 A:middle
to showcase the intent that the

00:26:07.386 --> 00:26:08.746 A:middle
glyphs are trying to communicate

00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:10.126 A:middle
to the user as effectively as

00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:10.666 A:middle
possible.

00:26:12.476 --> 00:26:14.486 A:middle
Finally, make sure to go to the

00:26:14.486 --> 00:26:16.366 A:middle
Human Interface Guidelines to

00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:18.146 A:middle
see more design guidance.

00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:21.266 A:middle
And then as well as checking the

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:23.156 A:middle
design resources section, where,

00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:24.796 A:middle
by the end of the month, we're

00:26:24.796 --> 00:26:26.416 A:middle
going to be making available

00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:28.086 A:middle
updated Photoshop, and sketch

00:26:28.156 --> 00:26:29.376 A:middle
templates, and kits for you to

00:26:29.376 --> 00:26:29.656 A:middle
use.

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:32.086 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to hand

00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:34.756 A:middle
it off to Rachel to go over some

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:36.326 A:middle
details on how to adopt and

00:26:36.326 --> 00:26:37.086 A:middle
support Dark Mode.

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:38.076 A:middle
Thanks

Hello everybody.

00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:49.636 A:middle
Let's take a moment just to

00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:51.026 A:middle
thank Raymond and the rest of

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.536 A:middle
the design team for designing

00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:52.976 A:middle
Dark Mode.

00:26:52.976 --> 00:26:53.976 A:middle
Isn't it awesome?
