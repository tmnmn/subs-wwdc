&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:31.916 A:middle
Welcome to the Introduction to

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:32.986 A:middle
Dark Mode session.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.616 A:middle
My name is Raymond Sepulveda,

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.866 A:middle
and I'm a macOS designer on the

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.136 A:middle
Human Interface Design team.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:40.176 A:middle
For the first half of today's

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:41.436 A:middle
session, I'm going to be going

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:42.256 A:middle
over some of the design

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:43.826 A:middle
principles that went into the

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.756 A:middle
design of Dark Mode, as well as

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:46.746 A:middle
some of the design

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.686 A:middle
considerations that you should

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:49.336 A:middle
take into account when updating

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:50.546 A:middle
your own applications to take

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:51.606 A:middle
advantage of Dark Mode.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:53.576 A:middle
Then, for the second half of the

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.316 A:middle
session, my engineering

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.106 A:middle
colleagues Rachel Goldeen and

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:58.266 A:middle
Taylor Kelly from the Cocoa

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.756 A:middle
Frameworks team are going to be

going over how to adopt and
