00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:01.836 A:middle
going over how to adopt and

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:03.506 A:middle
support Dark Mode using an

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:04.866 A:middle
example application that they

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.426 A:middle
built together.

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:07.016 A:middle
The three of us are super

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:08.016 A:middle
excited to share all of these

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
details with all of you, so

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:10.086 A:middle
let's jump right in.

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:13.086 A:middle
As we announced in yesterday's

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.316 A:middle
keynote, macOS 10.14 is going to

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
be getting a new interface

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.186 A:middle
appearance, and we call it Dark

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:19.416 A:middle
Mode.

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:22.146 A:middle
The new design is very

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.466 A:middle
attractive and engaging, while

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.036 A:middle
at the same time being very calm

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:26.806 A:middle
and understated.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.566 A:middle
These are great qualities for an

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.626 A:middle
interface, and they make it

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.266 A:middle
great for creative professionals

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.076 A:middle
who are dealing with heavily

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:34.906 A:middle
detailed images and colorful

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.516 A:middle
assets such as images and video

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:37.896 A:middle
assets.

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:40.966 A:middle
But, in actuality, it's actually

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.536 A:middle
great for just about any type of

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:44.526 A:middle
user who is looking to

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:46.326 A:middle
concentrate or focus on any

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:47.376 A:middle
given task at hand.

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:48.936 A:middle
So, whether you're trying to

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.396 A:middle
concentrate on writing the next

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:52.856 A:middle
great novel or you're trying to

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.146 A:middle
read one without disturbing your

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.136 A:middle
bedside partner, Dark Mode is

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:57.486 A:middle
really great for either type of

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:58.156 A:middle
situation.
