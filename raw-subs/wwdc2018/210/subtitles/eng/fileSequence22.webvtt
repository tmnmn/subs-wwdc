00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:02.376 A:middle
other process, but one important

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:04.066 A:middle
aspect of this glyph, in

00:22:04.066 --> 00:22:06.316 A:middle
particular, was that we have to

00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:09.116 A:middle
add a new shape into the vector

00:22:09.116 --> 00:22:09.536 A:middle
form.

00:22:09.846 --> 00:22:11.036 A:middle
In this case, we're mimicking

00:22:11.036 --> 00:22:13.646 A:middle
the roof line, creating a shadow

00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:15.326 A:middle
underneath the roof that we're

00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:17.286 A:middle
going to knock out.

00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:18.646 A:middle
And this is important, because

00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:20.826 A:middle
if we were to have left the

00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:21.816 A:middle
construction of the house

00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:23.706 A:middle
without that shadow line, the

00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:25.186 A:middle
roof would have no definition,

00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:26.136 A:middle
and it would be really hard to

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.586 A:middle
see that at small size.

00:22:29.936 --> 00:22:32.156 A:middle
Moving on to a more complicated

00:22:32.586 --> 00:22:35.056 A:middle
glyph, like this mail envelope,

00:22:35.056 --> 00:22:35.666 A:middle
for example.

00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:37.646 A:middle
On the left side, we can see a

00:22:37.686 --> 00:22:38.986 A:middle
sense of volume and shape.

00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:41.086 A:middle
We've got two layers, generally.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.656 A:middle
We've got the back flap of the

00:22:42.656 --> 00:22:43.626 A:middle
envelope, and we've got the

00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:45.696 A:middle
front flap of the envelope with

00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:47.026 A:middle
a letter contained in between.

00:22:47.426 --> 00:22:48.876 A:middle
On the right side, a lot of that

00:22:48.876 --> 00:22:50.456 A:middle
sense of volume is just missing

00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:52.466 A:middle
because of the lack of fill

00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:53.096 A:middle
colors.

00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:56.306 A:middle
And so, once we invert that, we

00:22:56.306 --> 00:22:57.576 A:middle
return back to having a sense of

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:57.956 A:middle
volume.

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.736 A:middle
Again, generally, the process of
