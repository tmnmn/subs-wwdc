00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
As we all know, macOS is a

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.786 A:middle
layered window environment, and

00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:03.946 A:middle
the window shadows really help

00:08:03.946 --> 00:08:04.946 A:middle
to communicate the sense of

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.236 A:middle
depth, the Z-depth of the

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:06.766 A:middle
windows.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:08.686 A:middle
So, if we were to have inverted

00:08:08.686 --> 00:08:10.056 A:middle
the window shadows, for example,

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:11.406 A:middle
and started using a white

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:13.246 A:middle
shadow, for example, the entire

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:14.606 A:middle
UI would have become flat.

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
You would have lost that sense

00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:19.186 A:middle
of depth.

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:20.256 A:middle
Another thing to note is that

00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:21.836 A:middle
the window shadows in macOS are

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.206 A:middle
constructed of two layers.

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.666 A:middle
We've got the diffused shadow

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:25.546 A:middle
and the rim shadow.

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:27.536 A:middle
So, if we look at this little

00:08:27.536 --> 00:08:30.626 A:middle
portion of the screen and look

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:31.256 A:middle
at how the shadows were

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:33.126 A:middle
constructed and treated in Dark

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:35.166 A:middle
Mode, the first thing to note is

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:36.775 A:middle
that, in taking into

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:38.895 A:middle
consideration that users are

00:08:39.196 --> 00:08:40.775 A:middle
going to be able to go back and

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:42.086 A:middle
forth between light and dark

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.536 A:middle
appearance quite often and that

00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:45.916 A:middle
some apps are going to stay dark

00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:47.766 A:middle
all the time, it was important

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:48.996 A:middle
for us to keep the diffused

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.896 A:middle
shadow exactly the same.

00:08:51.546 --> 00:08:53.706 A:middle
So, we used the exact same

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:55.406 A:middle
shadow blur parameters for the

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:56.796 A:middle
shadows in Dark Mode.

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.536 A:middle
Next, we took a look at the rim

00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
shadows and saw what changes we
