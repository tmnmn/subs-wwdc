00:05:57.996 --> 00:06:00.416 A:middle
be easy to think of just taking

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:01.486 A:middle
the light interface and

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.826 A:middle
inverting it to end up with your

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:03.666 A:middle
final result.

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:05.946 A:middle
But, in actuality, that can be

00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:07.986 A:middle
very creatively limiting, and so

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:09.526 A:middle
it's better to take a look at

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:10.276 A:middle
your elements and your

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.186 A:middle
application on a case-by-case

00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:16.006 A:middle
basis and try to determine what

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:18.316 A:middle
is the visual cue that they're

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.826 A:middle
trying to communicate and then

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.926 A:middle
figure out whether an opposite

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:23.406 A:middle
visual cue is necessary.

00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:25.136 A:middle
So, if you take something, for

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:27.376 A:middle
example, like, a standard Light

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.706 A:middle
push button in the light

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:30.376 A:middle
appearance, the buttons look

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:31.756 A:middle
like this in their active state.

00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:33.656 A:middle
And, then, when you click on

00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:35.026 A:middle
them, the buttons darken.

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:37.046 A:middle
And this is generally true of

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:38.546 A:middle
almost all of the controls in

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:39.636 A:middle
the light appearance in that

00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:41.336 A:middle
their click state is a darker

00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:42.486 A:middle
version of what their active

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:43.056 A:middle
state was.

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:45.716 A:middle
In Dark Mode, however, the

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:47.096 A:middle
general active state looks like

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:48.996 A:middle
this, and when you click on

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:50.486 A:middle
them, they brighten, and that,

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.096 A:middle
again, is generally true of all

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:52.866 A:middle
of the controls.

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:54.546 A:middle
They will all generally brighten

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:56.746 A:middle
up.

00:06:56.746 --> 00:06:59.446 A:middle
Another example are group boxes.
