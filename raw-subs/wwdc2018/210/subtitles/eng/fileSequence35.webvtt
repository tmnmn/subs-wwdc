00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:02.116 A:middle
selectedTextColor goes from

00:35:02.116 --> 00:35:04.496 A:middle
black to white; and then

00:35:04.496 --> 00:35:06.346 A:middle
selectedTextBackgroundColor,

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:07.166 A:middle
which is blue.

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.266 A:middle
But you can see it's two

00:35:08.266 --> 00:35:10.376 A:middle
different versions of blue, and

00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:12.676 A:middle
this is special, because it

00:35:12.676 --> 00:35:14.136 A:middle
follows the system preference

00:35:14.136 --> 00:35:15.146 A:middle
for the highlight color.

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:16.616 A:middle
And you can see, when the

00:35:16.676 --> 00:35:18.256 A:middle
highlight color changes, the

00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:19.996 A:middle
selectedTextBackgroundColor

00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:21.746 A:middle
changes with it.

00:35:22.426 --> 00:35:24.896 A:middle
Now, I'd like to move along and

00:35:24.896 --> 00:35:26.296 A:middle
talk about accessibility.

00:35:28.676 --> 00:35:30.206 A:middle
In the Accessibility display

00:35:30.206 --> 00:35:31.516 A:middle
preferences, there's the

00:35:31.516 --> 00:35:33.216 A:middle
Increase contrast checkbox.

00:35:34.526 --> 00:35:36.316 A:middle
If we turn on Increase contrast

00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:38.706 A:middle
mode, you'll see that colors and

00:35:38.706 --> 00:35:40.176 A:middle
artwork throughout the system

00:35:40.176 --> 00:35:42.916 A:middle
change to make the UI easier to

00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:43.986 A:middle
see for people to see with low

00:35:43.986 --> 00:35:44.406 A:middle
vision.

00:35:45.786 --> 00:35:49.616 A:middle
Well, now in asset catalogs, we

00:35:49.616 --> 00:35:52.006 A:middle
can add colors specially for the

00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:53.646 A:middle
high contrast appearances as

00:35:53.646 --> 00:35:53.966 A:middle
well.

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.256 A:middle
So, here I've added to my header

00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:58.376 A:middle
color a version for high

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.306 A:middle
contrast light and high contrast
