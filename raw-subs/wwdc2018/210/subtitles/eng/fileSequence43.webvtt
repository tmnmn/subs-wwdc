00:42:59.436 --> 00:43:00.886 A:middle
adjust to that yellow accent

00:43:00.886 --> 00:43:02.816 A:middle
color, including the focus ring

00:43:02.926 --> 00:43:03.736 A:middle
and highlight color.

00:43:04.986 --> 00:43:05.976 A:middle
However, we can notice that our

00:43:05.976 --> 00:43:07.546 A:middle
custom tab bar has remained

00:43:07.546 --> 00:43:09.146 A:middle
blue, even though we've changed

00:43:09.146 --> 00:43:09.756 A:middle
the accent color.

00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:12.366 A:middle
Because this blue doesn't really

00:43:12.366 --> 00:43:13.636 A:middle
have any significance for our

00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:15.356 A:middle
application, we probably want it

00:43:15.356 --> 00:43:17.586 A:middle
to be following that accent

00:43:18.576 --> 00:43:18.716 A:middle
color.

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.136 A:middle
Like Rachel talked about, we

00:43:20.136 --> 00:43:21.876 A:middle
have a few different colors that

00:43:21.876 --> 00:43:23.786 A:middle
will follow the users' accent

00:43:23.786 --> 00:43:24.896 A:middle
and highlight color selection.

00:43:25.876 --> 00:43:27.396 A:middle
New in Mojave is a control

00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.186 A:middle
accent color, which you can use

00:43:29.266 --> 00:43:31.166 A:middle
to directly mimic the accented

00:43:31.166 --> 00:43:33.096 A:middle
areas on system controls, such

00:43:33.096 --> 00:43:34.536 A:middle
as the sides of popup buttons,

00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:36.386 A:middle
default push buttons, or the

00:43:36.386 --> 00:43:37.706 A:middle
selected segment of a segmented

00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:38.126 A:middle
control.

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:40.936 A:middle
There's also selected content

00:43:40.936 --> 00:43:41.926 A:middle
background color, which is what

00:43:41.926 --> 00:43:43.006 A:middle
you see in the background of

00:43:43.006 --> 00:43:44.586 A:middle
selected table rows, and you can

00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:45.556 A:middle
use to indicate custom

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.136 A:middle
selection.

00:43:47.426 --> 00:43:48.486 A:middle
And selected text background

00:43:48.486 --> 00:43:50.366 A:middle
color is exactly what it sounds

00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:50.616 A:middle
like.

00:43:51.136 --> 00:43:53.606 A:middle
So, going back to our app, we

00:43:53.606 --> 00:43:54.906 A:middle
can see that we're using system

00:43:54.906 --> 00:43:56.506 A:middle
blue color for this custom tab

00:43:56.506 --> 00:43:58.376 A:middle
selection, and, instead, we can

00:43:58.376 --> 00:43:59.696 A:middle
just swap that over to using

00:43:59.696 --> 00:44:00.756 A:middle
controlAccentColor.
