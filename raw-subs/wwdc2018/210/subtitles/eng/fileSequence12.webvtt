00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.216 A:middle
One thing that all three of

00:12:00.216 --> 00:12:01.866 A:middle
these windows had in common was

00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:03.796 A:middle
that the chrome remained dark

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:06.096 A:middle
and became secondary to the

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:06.826 A:middle
content area.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.026 A:middle
And Dark Mode kind of achieves

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:10.666 A:middle
this using a feature that we

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:11.946 A:middle
call desktop tinting, which

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:14.586 A:middle
causes the window's background

00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:16.576 A:middle
colors to camouflage themselves

00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:17.966 A:middle
with the desktop picture.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.286 A:middle
We found that completely

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.386 A:middle
desaturated gray colors have a

00:12:22.386 --> 00:12:23.606 A:middle
tendency to have a color

00:12:23.606 --> 00:12:25.226 A:middle
temperature that was sometimes

00:12:25.226 --> 00:12:26.336 A:middle
in conflict with what your

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:28.596 A:middle
desktop picture was, and this

00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:30.496 A:middle
effect was magnified when you

00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:32.646 A:middle
have a translucent sidebar area,

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:35.696 A:middle
for example, against a solid

00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:38.526 A:middle
opaque area of your window, and

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:39.626 A:middle
so desktop tinting helps

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:40.416 A:middle
mitigate that.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:41.986 A:middle
Once applied, the desktop

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.656 A:middle
tinting gives the whole window a

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:45.346 A:middle
harmonious color scheme, which

00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:48.716 A:middle
helps it to blend in with the

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:50.916 A:middle
surrounding areas and really

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:52.236 A:middle
reduces that color temperature

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:52.906 A:middle
disparity.

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:56.616 A:middle
So, how do we do the desktop

00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:57.776 A:middle
tinting effect?

00:12:57.896 --> 00:12:58.916 A:middle
The first thing that we do is,

00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.946 A:middle
actually, we take a sample of
