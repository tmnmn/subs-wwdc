00:40:58.396 --> 00:41:00.426 A:middle
So, we could just pull the color

00:41:00.426 --> 00:41:02.296 A:middle
out of the asset, add a dark

00:41:02.296 --> 00:41:03.946 A:middle
variant, and set the

00:41:03.946 --> 00:41:05.096 A:middle
contentTintColor on these

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:06.616 A:middle
buttons to be that named color.

00:41:06.616 --> 00:41:08.506 A:middle
And this button will

00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:09.726 A:middle
automatically pick the right

00:41:09.726 --> 00:41:10.986 A:middle
variant based on whether it's

00:41:10.986 --> 00:41:11.716 A:middle
appearing in the light

00:41:11.716 --> 00:41:14.256 A:middle
appearance or dark appearance.

00:41:14.256 --> 00:41:15.656 A:middle
However, Rachel also showed us

00:41:15.656 --> 00:41:16.366 A:middle
how there are a number of

00:41:16.366 --> 00:41:18.306 A:middle
colorful system colors that

00:41:18.306 --> 00:41:19.456 A:middle
already have these light and

00:41:19.456 --> 00:41:20.926 A:middle
dark variants, which we could

00:41:20.926 --> 00:41:21.556 A:middle
use instead.

00:41:22.016 --> 00:41:24.646 A:middle
For instance, we could use

00:41:24.776 --> 00:41:26.416 A:middle
systemRed, systemYellow, and

00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:28.806 A:middle
systemGreen, which, if we return

00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:29.986 A:middle
back to Chameleon Wrangler, we

00:41:29.986 --> 00:41:31.626 A:middle
can see looks really great and

00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:33.596 A:middle
has those buttons pop on top of

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:34.196 A:middle
that background.

00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:36.816 A:middle
What's really cool about this

00:41:36.816 --> 00:41:39.086 A:middle
combination is that not only do

00:41:39.086 --> 00:41:41.306 A:middle
we get a very specific green

00:41:41.306 --> 00:41:42.686 A:middle
color for both Light and Dark

00:41:42.686 --> 00:41:44.686 A:middle
Mode, but with the content tint

00:41:44.686 --> 00:41:46.496 A:middle
API, the system effects applied

00:41:46.496 --> 00:41:48.226 A:middle
on top of that vary based on

00:41:48.226 --> 00:41:49.046 A:middle
appearance as well.

00:41:49.926 --> 00:41:51.666 A:middle
As Raymond discussed, in the

00:41:51.666 --> 00:41:52.856 A:middle
light appearance, there's a

00:41:52.856 --> 00:41:54.316 A:middle
darkening effect on top of that

00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:55.086 A:middle
base tint color.

00:41:55.686 --> 00:41:56.436 A:middle
Meanwhile, in the dark

00:41:56.436 --> 00:41:57.406 A:middle
appearance, there's a

00:41:57.406 --> 00:41:58.966 A:middle
brightening effect.
