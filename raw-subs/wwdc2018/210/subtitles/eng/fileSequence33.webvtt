00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:00.106 A:middle
well as matching on iOS.

00:33:01.656 --> 00:33:03.246 A:middle
So, it's great to stick to these

00:33:03.316 --> 00:33:05.826 A:middle
kinds of colors when you have an

00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:07.176 A:middle
informational content in your

00:33:07.176 --> 00:33:07.536 A:middle
color.

00:33:07.536 --> 00:33:09.256 A:middle
It needs to be red or yellow for

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:10.326 A:middle
a warning, for example.

00:33:13.276 --> 00:33:15.016 A:middle
Raymond also talked about

00:33:15.706 --> 00:33:17.316 A:middle
linkColor, systemBlue, and

00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:18.946 A:middle
controlAccentColor, so I wanted

00:33:18.946 --> 00:33:20.146 A:middle
to talk about that again.

00:33:21.486 --> 00:33:22.776 A:middle
LinkColor and systemBlue are

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:24.126 A:middle
very similar but slightly

00:33:24.126 --> 00:33:26.296 A:middle
different and use linkColor for

00:33:26.296 --> 00:33:29.466 A:middle
actual links to webpages or for

00:33:29.626 --> 00:33:30.636 A:middle
going someplace in your app,

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:33.786 A:middle
whereas systemBlue is used for

00:33:33.786 --> 00:33:34.926 A:middle
standard actions in your

00:33:34.926 --> 00:33:36.576 A:middle
application, or you might even

00:33:36.576 --> 00:33:38.086 A:middle
use controlAccentColor if you

00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:39.096 A:middle
want to match the system

00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:40.576 A:middle
preference, in this case,

00:33:40.576 --> 00:33:40.916 A:middle
purple.

00:33:42.676 --> 00:33:45.106 A:middle
You may search through your

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.486 A:middle
application code and find all

00:33:47.486 --> 00:33:48.866 A:middle
the places you're using color

00:33:48.866 --> 00:33:51.526 A:middle
and fix it all up and then still

00:33:51.526 --> 00:33:53.226 A:middle
end up with a situation like

00:33:53.296 --> 00:33:55.916 A:middle
this, where, for some reason,

00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:57.376 A:middle
even though your text switched

00:33:57.376 --> 00:33:58.856 A:middle
color, there's something behind

00:33:58.856 --> 00:34:00.236 A:middle
it that's still drawing wrong.
