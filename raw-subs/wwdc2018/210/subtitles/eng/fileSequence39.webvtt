00:38:59.686 --> 00:39:01.146 A:middle
We got some of our images sorted

00:39:01.146 --> 00:39:02.986 A:middle
out, but there's more to the

00:39:02.986 --> 00:39:04.386 A:middle
application than what you see

00:39:04.386 --> 00:39:06.266 A:middle
here, so I'd like to invite

00:39:06.296 --> 00:39:08.216 A:middle
Taylor to the stage to tell you

00:39:08.216 --> 00:39:08.986 A:middle
about the rest of it.

00:39:10.126 --> 00:39:10.906 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:15.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:18.736 --> 00:39:19.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Rachel.

00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:21.396 A:middle
Now that Rachel's covered a lot

00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:22.766 A:middle
of the fundamentals of having

00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:24.526 A:middle
our colors and images react

00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:25.726 A:middle
appropriately for Dark Mode,

00:39:26.356 --> 00:39:27.386 A:middle
let's first take a look at

00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:28.486 A:middle
applying some of those to some

00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:29.586 A:middle
more detailed areas of our

00:39:29.586 --> 00:39:30.206 A:middle
application.

00:39:30.376 --> 00:39:32.876 A:middle
First up is Moodometer, where we

00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:34.746 A:middle
can keep track of Chloe's mood

00:39:34.746 --> 00:39:36.046 A:middle
shifts throughout the day.

00:39:37.036 --> 00:39:37.846 A:middle
You can see here that the

00:39:37.846 --> 00:39:39.076 A:middle
popover's background has

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.646 A:middle
automatically adjusted for the

00:39:40.646 --> 00:39:41.126 A:middle
Dark Mode.

00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:43.706 A:middle
However, the button content is

00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:45.576 A:middle
way too dark, still, on top of

00:39:45.576 --> 00:39:46.126 A:middle
the background.

00:39:47.626 --> 00:39:48.456 A:middle
Taking a look at our Asa

00:39:48.456 --> 00:39:50.136 A:middle
Catalog, we can see that we've

00:39:50.336 --> 00:39:52.296 A:middle
prebuilt these images with the

00:39:52.296 --> 00:39:53.596 A:middle
color defined in the asset

00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:55.396 A:middle
themself.

00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:56.316 A:middle
So, we can use the technique

00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:57.776 A:middle
that Rachel showed us, where we

00:39:57.776 --> 00:39:59.106 A:middle
add a dark variant for those

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.086 A:middle
images with a lighter color.
