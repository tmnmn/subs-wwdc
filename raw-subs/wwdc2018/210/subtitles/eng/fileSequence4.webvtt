00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.686 A:middle
At Apple, when we begin a new

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:02.916 A:middle
design project, we like to

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:04.326 A:middle
establish a set of design

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:05.456 A:middle
principles to help guide us

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:06.476 A:middle
throughout the entire design

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:06.996 A:middle
process.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:09.506 A:middle
And, with Dark Mode, there were

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:11.426 A:middle
three in particular that we

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:12.786 A:middle
referred to quite often

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:14.606 A:middle
throughout the entire process.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:16.505 A:middle
The first one is the most

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:17.625 A:middle
straightforward, so let's just

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:19.696 A:middle
jump right into that one, and

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:20.976 A:middle
that is that dark interfaces are

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:23.716 A:middle
cool, period, right?

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:25.386 A:middle
They are almost effortlessly

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:26.736 A:middle
cool in a way that light

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:28.116 A:middle
interfaces sometimes kind of

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:28.976 A:middle
struggle to be.

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.006 A:middle
But why is that, really?

00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:32.926 A:middle
Part of it is because we all

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:34.206 A:middle
have these notions of what a

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:35.706 A:middle
dark interface is and what a

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:36.876 A:middle
dark interface looks like.

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:38.646 A:middle
And a lot of that is fed into us

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:39.876 A:middle
by what we've seen in pop

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:41.286 A:middle
cultures in things such as

00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:43.626 A:middle
sci-fi movies and action movies.

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:45.456 A:middle
So much so that if I were to go

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:46.476 A:middle
around the audience and ask

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:47.716 A:middle
everyone to give me one-word

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.476 A:middle
association of what a dark

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:51.236 A:middle
interface is to them, I'd get

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:52.516 A:middle
responses such as cool, of

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:55.596 A:middle
course; slick; professional;

00:04:56.056 --> 00:04:58.276 A:middle
futuristic; and even beautiful.

00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:01.786 A:middle
So going into the design for
