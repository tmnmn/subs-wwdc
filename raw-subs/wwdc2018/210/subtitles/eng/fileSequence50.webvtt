00:50:00.186 --> 00:50:02.006 A:middle
However, in our notes section,

00:50:02.326 --> 00:50:03.296 A:middle
where we have this awesome

00:50:03.296 --> 00:50:05.836 A:middle
custom stationary, we have a

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.426 A:middle
light grey background that isn't

00:50:07.426 --> 00:50:08.456 A:middle
appropriate for Dark Mode and

00:50:08.456 --> 00:50:10.016 A:middle
hasn't been adjusted with that

00:50:10.016 --> 00:50:11.096 A:middle
under page semantic.

00:50:11.576 --> 00:50:14.366 A:middle
We can open up Interface Builder

00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:15.436 A:middle
and see where we're setting up

00:50:15.436 --> 00:50:17.056 A:middle
this background drawing view and

00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:18.756 A:middle
see that, indeed, we are filing

00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:19.976 A:middle
it with a custom gray color.

00:50:21.006 --> 00:50:23.356 A:middle
And pretty quickly in IB, we can

00:50:23.356 --> 00:50:24.486 A:middle
change that to using the Under

00:50:24.486 --> 00:50:25.986 A:middle
Page Background color that

00:50:25.986 --> 00:50:27.626 A:middle
represents that semantic and

00:50:27.626 --> 00:50:28.626 A:middle
immediately see that we'll get

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:30.696 A:middle
the right result, making it look

00:50:31.116 --> 00:50:32.286 A:middle
just at home with the rest of

00:50:32.286 --> 00:50:34.646 A:middle
the document apps in Dark Mode.

00:50:34.646 --> 00:50:37.516 A:middle
The next thing that kind of

00:50:37.516 --> 00:50:38.636 A:middle
stands out here, though, is the

00:50:38.636 --> 00:50:40.156 A:middle
dark foreground on top of light

00:50:40.156 --> 00:50:42.376 A:middle
background of our stationary and

00:50:42.376 --> 00:50:43.036 A:middle
document area.

00:50:43.036 --> 00:50:45.276 A:middle
And because this is a WYSIWYG

00:50:45.276 --> 00:50:47.206 A:middle
editor where we, as users of

00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:48.676 A:middle
Chameleon Wrangler have complete

00:50:48.676 --> 00:50:51.276 A:middle
control over the colors, images,

00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:53.876 A:middle
and fonts seen within it, we

00:50:53.876 --> 00:50:55.846 A:middle
expect this to stay the same as

00:50:55.846 --> 00:50:57.356 A:middle
a light appearing document.

00:50:58.566 --> 00:50:59.656 A:middle
However, there are a few subtle

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.406 A:middle
details that don't seem quite
