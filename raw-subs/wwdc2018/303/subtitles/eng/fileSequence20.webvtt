00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:00.756 A:middle
might be in multiple groups,

00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:01.086 A:middle
right.

00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:02.546 A:middle
The way we have this structured,

00:20:03.046 --> 00:20:04.316 A:middle
the data for John Appleseed is

00:20:04.316 --> 00:20:05.796 A:middle
only in the response one time,

00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:07.286 A:middle
no matter how many groups they

00:20:07.286 --> 00:20:08.786 A:middle
appear in, in the response.

00:20:08.906 --> 00:20:09.286 A:middle
Make sense?

00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:12.896 A:middle
Okay. Sehoon is going to come

00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:14.256 A:middle
back up now and show us some

00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:16.086 A:middle
more real-world examples with

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:16.746 A:middle
relationships.

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:17.196 A:middle
Sehoon.

00:20:23.476 --> 00:20:24.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Geoff.

00:20:26.336 --> 00:20:28.176 A:middle
So for this part of the demo

00:20:28.256 --> 00:20:29.666 A:middle
we'll look at TestFlight and see

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:30.746 A:middle
how we can create new beta

00:20:30.746 --> 00:20:32.276 A:middle
groups and add some external

00:20:32.276 --> 00:20:33.566 A:middle
testers and we'll see some

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.216 A:middle
relationship between testers and

00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:35.636 A:middle
groups.

00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:36.976 A:middle
So let's go see the demo.

00:20:46.176 --> 00:20:48.116 A:middle
We'll start by creating a new

00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:49.746 A:middle
beta group by posting to the

00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:51.296 A:middle
beta groups endpoint which is

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.806 A:middle
v1/beta Groups.

00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:55.546 A:middle
When we're creating a resource,

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:56.696 A:middle
we also need to provide the

00:20:56.696 --> 00:20:57.926 A:middle
payload that looks like this.

00:20:57.986 --> 00:20:59.476 A:middle
We have the data with the type

00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:00.816 A:middle
of beta Groups and a set of
