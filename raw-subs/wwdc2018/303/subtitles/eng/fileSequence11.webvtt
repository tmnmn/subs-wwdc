00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:00.066 A:middle
role.

00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:01.846 A:middle
So let's change that so they

00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:02.896 A:middle
have the developer and the

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:03.556 A:middle
marketing role.

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:05.706 A:middle
We're changing an existing

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:06.236 A:middle
resource.

00:11:06.336 --> 00:11:07.656 A:middle
So we do a PATCH request.

00:11:08.386 --> 00:11:09.766 A:middle
The URL this time is the

00:11:09.766 --> 00:11:12.256 A:middle
resource self link of the user

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.046 A:middle
we're changing.

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:14.396 A:middle
And if you look at the

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:16.326 A:middle
attributes, we're only including

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:17.676 A:middle
the roles attribute.

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:19.236 A:middle
This request says change this

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:21.016 A:middle
user so that they have the roles

00:11:21.016 --> 00:11:22.776 A:middle
of DEVELOPER and MARKETING.

00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:23.796 A:middle
We didn't want to change

00:11:23.796 --> 00:11:25.066 A:middle
anything else about the user, so

00:11:25.066 --> 00:11:26.546 A:middle
we specifically didn't include

00:11:26.856 --> 00:11:27.836 A:middle
the other attributes.

00:11:28.836 --> 00:11:30.336 A:middle
If we run this request, again we

00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:32.656 A:middle
get a successful response and we

00:11:32.656 --> 00:11:33.646 A:middle
get the full resource

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:35.646 A:middle
representation of the resource

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:36.956 A:middle
with our changes applied.

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:39.776 A:middle
Now the last thing you probably

00:11:39.776 --> 00:11:40.746 A:middle
want to do with the resource is

00:11:40.746 --> 00:11:41.776 A:middle
delete it and this is the

00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:43.176 A:middle
simplest operation of them all.

00:11:43.396 --> 00:11:45.326 A:middle
We just do a DELETE request to

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:47.056 A:middle
the resource self link and we

00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:49.536 A:middle
get a 204 NO CONTENT response.

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:51.046 A:middle
If you're familiar with REST,

00:11:51.046 --> 00:11:52.336 A:middle
you know that any status code in

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.376 A:middle
the 200s means success.

00:11:54.886 --> 00:11:56.316 A:middle
So this is the API telling you

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.806 A:middle
that the user has successfully

00:11:57.806 --> 00:11:58.556 A:middle
been deleted.

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.156 A:middle
And we didn't need to include
