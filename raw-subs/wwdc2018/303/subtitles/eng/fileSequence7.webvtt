00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:01.136 A:middle
response with data in it, we

00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:02.336 A:middle
include this data property.

00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:04.666 A:middle
In this case, it's an array of

00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:06.036 A:middle
user resources.

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:08.136 A:middle
Now, you can only see one user

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.136 A:middle
on the screen right now but if

00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:10.106 A:middle
the screen were much, much

00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:11.576 A:middle
taller, you'd see that all the

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.116 A:middle
users in your team are in this

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:13.406 A:middle
array.

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:15.726 A:middle
Now I want to focus in on some

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.366 A:middle
of the data we return to you

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:18.776 A:middle
with each of these resource

00:07:18.776 --> 00:07:19.406 A:middle
responses.

00:07:20.086 --> 00:07:21.856 A:middle
Every resource has a type just

00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:23.536 A:middle
telling you what it is and an ID

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:25.476 A:middle
that uniquely identifies this

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:27.446 A:middle
resource across all of App Store

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:27.796 A:middle
Connect.

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:30.046 A:middle
Then we have the attributes.

00:07:30.506 --> 00:07:31.666 A:middle
This is probably the stuff that

00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:32.596 A:middle
you're most interested in.

00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:33.996 A:middle
For users, it's things like

00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:36.026 A:middle
their first name, last name, and

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:36.826 A:middle
email address.

00:07:37.596 --> 00:07:38.906 A:middle
The values of these attributes

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:40.086 A:middle
are usually simple types like

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.286 A:middle
this, strings, numbers, dates

00:07:42.286 --> 00:07:44.066 A:middle
and times or Booleans but they

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:45.246 A:middle
can also be complex types

00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:46.346 A:middle
sometimes, like arrays and

00:07:46.346 --> 00:07:46.876 A:middle
objects.

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:49.326 A:middle
After the attributes, we have

00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:50.156 A:middle
relationships.

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:51.606 A:middle
We're going to skip those for

00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:51.826 A:middle
now.

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:52.756 A:middle
We'll come back and look at them

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:52.996 A:middle
later.

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:54.896 A:middle
And then we have links and in

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:55.976 A:middle
particular what we call the

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.766 A:middle
resource self link.

00:07:58.286 --> 00:08:00.016 A:middle
Now this is a URL that uniquely
