00:13:59.376 --> 00:14:01.376 A:middle
sending DELETE request to self

00:14:01.376 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
link of this user.

00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:05.496 A:middle
So we'll replace GET with

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:05.886 A:middle
DELETE.

00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:08.526 A:middle
And this should remove the user

00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:09.386 A:middle
with the matching ID.

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:14.816 A:middle
And we get a 204, which means

00:14:14.816 --> 00:14:16.326 A:middle
the deletion was successful and

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.056 A:middle
NO CONTENT since the content of

00:14:18.056 --> 00:14:19.636 A:middle
user is no longer available.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.786 A:middle
Finally, let's confirm that the

00:14:21.786 --> 00:14:23.376 A:middle
user is indeed removed by

00:14:23.376 --> 00:14:24.756 A:middle
sending GET request to the self

00:14:24.756 --> 00:14:25.536 A:middle
link once again.

00:14:25.536 --> 00:14:29.306 A:middle
And now we get 404 NOT FOUND and

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:30.926 A:middle
it looks like the user is indeed

00:14:30.926 --> 00:14:31.286 A:middle
removed.

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:35.926 A:middle
So in this demo, we saw how to

00:14:35.926 --> 00:14:37.616 A:middle
get collections of user, how to

00:14:37.616 --> 00:14:40.116 A:middle
find instance of user, how to

00:14:40.116 --> 00:14:41.936 A:middle
search user by applying filter,

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:43.886 A:middle
and how to remove user by

00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:44.956 A:middle
sending DELETE request.

00:14:45.796 --> 00:14:47.136 A:middle
And this concludes the demo on

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.226 A:middle
how to use App Source Connect

00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:49.986 A:middle
API with the users resource.

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:51.626 A:middle
And I'll give the stage back to

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:51.796 A:middle
Geoff.

00:14:51.796 --> 00:14:51.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:58.746 A:middle

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:02.296 A:middle
