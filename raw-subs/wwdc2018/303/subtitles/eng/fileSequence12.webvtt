00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.156 A:middle
And we didn't need to include

00:12:00.156 --> 00:12:01.436 A:middle
any additional data this time,

00:12:01.706 --> 00:12:03.286 A:middle
so we use the NO CONTENT version

00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:04.606 A:middle
of a success response.

00:12:05.156 --> 00:12:07.886 A:middle
Now before we move on to the

00:12:07.886 --> 00:12:09.056 A:middle
next segment, I'd like to invite

00:12:09.056 --> 00:12:10.656 A:middle
my colleague Sehoon Shon up to

00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:12.126 A:middle
show you some examples of how to

00:12:12.126 --> 00:12:13.406 A:middle
use these resources in

00:12:13.406 --> 00:12:14.356 A:middle
real-world scenarios.

00:12:14.596 --> 00:12:14.956 A:middle
Sehoon.

00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:21.436 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:22.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Geoff.

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:24.846 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:26.356 A:middle
My name is Sehoon Shon and I'm a

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:27.626 A:middle
software engineer in TestFlight

00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:29.476 A:middle
team and I'm here today to show

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:31.196 A:middle
you the live demo on App Store

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:31.776 A:middle
Connect API.

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:34.726 A:middle
We'll look at one use case and

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:36.446 A:middle
see how we can apply the API on

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:37.246 A:middle
users resource.

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:39.496 A:middle
Let's say someone in our team

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:41.166 A:middle
has left our company and we'd

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.716 A:middle
like to find this user and

00:12:42.716 --> 00:12:43.986 A:middle
remove this user from the team

00:12:44.086 --> 00:12:44.876 A:middle
in App Store Connect.

00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:45.976 A:middle
So let's go see a demo.
