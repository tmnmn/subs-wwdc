00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:00.096 A:middle
and we have the Transporter tool

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:01.816 A:middle
that lets you automate uploading

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:04.146 A:middle
the metadata.xml and also

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.385 A:middle
automate your build uploads.

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:07.406 A:middle
And then we have Reporter, the

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:08.336 A:middle
command line tool for

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:09.756 A:middle
downloading your sales and

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:10.746 A:middle
financial reports.

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:12.566 A:middle
And these tools are great.

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:14.506 A:middle
A lot of you use them but we've

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:15.536 A:middle
heard from you that you want

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:16.156 A:middle
even more.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:18.506 A:middle
You want access to more areas in

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.146 A:middle
App Store Connect and you want

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.436 A:middle
to integrate with more diverse

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:22.116 A:middle
workflows.

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:23.976 A:middle
And so we're really happy to

00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:25.536 A:middle
introduce the new App Store

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:25.966 A:middle
Connect API.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:33.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:34.846 A:middle
We're excited too.

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:37.656 A:middle
So this is a standards-based

00:01:37.656 --> 00:01:39.546 A:middle
REST API for App Store Connect.

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:41.796 A:middle
And if you ask me, that's the

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:43.216 A:middle
best part about it, it's a stock

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:45.356 A:middle
standard REST API with JSON

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:46.896 A:middle
responses, so it's going to feel

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:48.146 A:middle
familiar to a lot of you right

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:48.826 A:middle
out of the box.

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:50.726 A:middle
That also means you can use this

00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:52.906 A:middle
API from any platform, almost

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:54.396 A:middle
any programming language, and

00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:55.406 A:middle
using the tools that you're

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:57.046 A:middle
probably already using today.

00:01:57.046 --> 00:01:59.656 A:middle
And of course, the API needs to

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:00.346 A:middle
be secure.
