00:21:59.846 --> 00:22:04.006 A:middle
So let's copy this id.

00:22:04.136 --> 00:22:05.156 A:middle
So we just created a group

00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:05.986 A:middle
called Test Group.

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:07.236 A:middle
But what if you don't like the

00:22:07.236 --> 00:22:08.136 A:middle
name of the group we just

00:22:08.136 --> 00:22:08.736 A:middle
created?

00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:10.936 A:middle
We can modify the existing group

00:22:11.046 --> 00:22:12.836 A:middle
by sending PATCH request to the

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:13.786 A:middle
self link of this group.

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:18.066 A:middle
We'll send PATCH and then beta

00:22:18.496 --> 00:22:22.646 A:middle
Groups/the id and we'll also

00:22:22.646 --> 00:22:24.306 A:middle
need to provide the payload that

00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:25.236 A:middle
looks like this.

00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:27.806 A:middle
This looks a lot like payload

00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:29.336 A:middle
for posting but we also need to

00:22:29.336 --> 00:22:31.296 A:middle
provide the id to make sure that

00:22:31.296 --> 00:22:32.286 A:middle
we're modifying the correct

00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:32.576 A:middle
data.

00:22:32.656 --> 00:22:35.736 A:middle
And let's paste the id of the

00:22:35.736 --> 00:22:36.476 A:middle
beta Group.

00:22:36.476 --> 00:22:38.096 A:middle
And the only information we'd

00:22:38.096 --> 00:22:39.586 A:middle
like to change is the name.

00:22:39.986 --> 00:22:42.746 A:middle
So let's rename it to WWDC

00:22:44.216 --> 00:22:44.346 A:middle
Group.

00:22:44.516 --> 00:22:46.546 A:middle
And I'm sending the request and

00:22:46.546 --> 00:22:47.926 A:middle
now we get a 200 response and it

00:22:47.926 --> 00:22:48.926 A:middle
looks like the name has been

00:22:48.926 --> 00:22:49.666 A:middle
updated.

00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:51.896 A:middle
So now we have the group that we

00:22:51.896 --> 00:22:52.376 A:middle
wanted.

00:22:52.486 --> 00:22:53.996 A:middle
Let's start adding some external

00:22:53.996 --> 00:22:54.506 A:middle
testers.

00:22:55.186 --> 00:22:57.146 A:middle
To create tester, we send POST

00:22:57.146 --> 00:22:58.676 A:middle
request to the beta testers

00:22:58.676 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
endpoint, which is v1/beta
