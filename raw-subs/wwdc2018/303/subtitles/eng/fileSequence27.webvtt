00:26:59.556 --> 00:27:00.716 A:middle
email incorrectly.

00:27:01.296 --> 00:27:03.056 A:middle
So these are great values to log

00:27:03.056 --> 00:27:04.546 A:middle
and use in your troubleshooting

00:27:04.786 --> 00:27:07.246 A:middle
and learning the API, but you

00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:08.566 A:middle
don't want to use these in your

00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:08.886 A:middle
code.

00:27:08.886 --> 00:27:09.506 A:middle
You don't want to try and

00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:10.856 A:middle
interpret these with your code.

00:27:10.856 --> 00:27:12.296 A:middle
I don't make any promises that

00:27:12.296 --> 00:27:13.436 A:middle
we won't change the wording on

00:27:13.436 --> 00:27:15.326 A:middle
these messages over time without

00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:15.716 A:middle
warning.

00:27:17.056 --> 00:27:18.646 A:middle
For programmatic error handling,

00:27:19.056 --> 00:27:19.926 A:middle
you want to use the code

00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:20.846 A:middle
property instead.

00:27:21.366 --> 00:27:22.216 A:middle
This is a stable

00:27:22.216 --> 00:27:23.466 A:middle
machine-readable string that

00:27:23.466 --> 00:27:24.906 A:middle
represents what went wrong.

00:27:25.376 --> 00:27:27.186 A:middle
It's a hierarchical value with

00:27:27.186 --> 00:27:28.506 A:middle
dots between levels of

00:27:28.506 --> 00:27:29.296 A:middle
specificity.

00:27:29.626 --> 00:27:30.786 A:middle
So in this example, I can see

00:27:30.786 --> 00:27:32.086 A:middle
that I have a parameter error,

00:27:32.086 --> 00:27:33.926 A:middle
generally, and more specifically

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:35.146 A:middle
one of those parameters is

00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:35.786 A:middle
invalid.

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.686 A:middle
Now these codes can get very

00:27:37.686 --> 00:27:39.756 A:middle
long and very specific and

00:27:39.756 --> 00:27:40.786 A:middle
sometimes you don't care about

00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:41.986 A:middle
all that specificity.

00:27:41.986 --> 00:27:43.046 A:middle
In fact, usually you don't.

00:27:43.046 --> 00:27:44.796 A:middle
So we structure them this way so

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:46.036 A:middle
that you can do a prefix match

00:27:46.036 --> 00:27:47.906 A:middle
on the code and be as generic or

00:27:47.906 --> 00:27:49.866 A:middle
a specific as you need to be for

00:27:49.866 --> 00:27:51.156 A:middle
your particular use case.

00:27:51.816 --> 00:27:53.086 A:middle
But if you need to be specific,

00:27:53.186 --> 00:27:54.466 A:middle
say so you can report back to

00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:56.076 A:middle
your own users with clarity

00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:57.556 A:middle
about what went wrong, we try to

00:27:57.556 --> 00:27:58.746 A:middle
give you enough information to

00:27:58.746 --> 00:27:59.206 A:middle
do that.
