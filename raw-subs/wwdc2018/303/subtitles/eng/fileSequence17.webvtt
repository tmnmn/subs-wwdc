00:16:58.526 --> 00:17:00.036 A:middle
and its related beta testers.

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:00.966 A:middle
And this is where the

00:17:00.966 --> 00:17:02.766 A:middle
relationship self link comes in.

00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:04.296 A:middle
It looks like this.

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:05.976 A:middle
We do a POST request to the

00:17:05.976 --> 00:17:07.236 A:middle
relationship self link.

00:17:07.465 --> 00:17:09.016 A:middle
And if you look at the data

00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:10.326 A:middle
we're sending, it's these type

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:12.556 A:middle
and id pairs of the two testers

00:17:12.556 --> 00:17:13.705 A:middle
in this case that we want to add

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.356 A:middle
to this group.

00:17:14.796 --> 00:17:16.236 A:middle
So this request says take these

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:17.756 A:middle
two testers and put them into

00:17:17.756 --> 00:17:18.286 A:middle
this group.

00:17:18.376 --> 00:17:19.296 A:middle
We don't have to include more

00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:20.415 A:middle
tester information because the

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:21.406 A:middle
testers are already in

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:21.896 A:middle
TestFlight.

00:17:22.496 --> 00:17:25.096 A:middle
If we run it, we get a 204 NO

00:17:25.096 --> 00:17:26.236 A:middle
CONTENT response again.

00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:27.685 A:middle
That's the API telling you that

00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:28.786 A:middle
the testers have been added to

00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:29.186 A:middle
the group.

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:31.106 A:middle
I'm sure some of you are

00:17:31.106 --> 00:17:32.036 A:middle
wondering "What if I want to

00:17:32.036 --> 00:17:33.266 A:middle
take testers out of the group

00:17:33.266 --> 00:17:33.726 A:middle
instead?"

00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:34.986 A:middle
And the answer is you do it in

00:17:34.986 --> 00:17:35.916 A:middle
exactly the same way.

00:17:35.916 --> 00:17:36.926 A:middle
It's the same URL.

00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:38.486 A:middle
It's the same data format.

00:17:38.786 --> 00:17:39.716 A:middle
You'll just use the DELETE

00:17:39.716 --> 00:17:41.126 A:middle
method instead of the POST

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:41.496 A:middle
method.

00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:44.486 A:middle
Now let's take a look at Beta

00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:46.256 A:middle
Groups again and look at that

00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:46.926 A:middle
second link.

00:17:47.896 --> 00:17:50.716 A:middle
This is what we call the related

00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:50.956 A:middle
link.

00:17:51.546 --> 00:17:53.186 A:middle
This URL represents the actual

00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:54.836 A:middle
related data, in this case the

00:17:54.836 --> 00:17:56.076 A:middle
testers in this group.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.246 A:middle
If we go and get this data, we

00:17:58.246 --> 00:17:59.266 A:middle
get back an array of beta

00:17:59.266 --> 00:17:59.816 A:middle
testers.
