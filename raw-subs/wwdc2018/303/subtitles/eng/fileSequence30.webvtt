00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
You'll then use that key to

00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:02.806 A:middle
generate tokens and those tokens

00:30:02.806 --> 00:30:04.326 A:middle
will need to be sent with every

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:04.626 A:middle
request.

00:30:05.856 --> 00:30:06.936 A:middle
So let's start with API Key.

00:30:07.156 --> 00:30:12.136 A:middle
Each key is actually a public

00:30:12.136 --> 00:30:13.456 A:middle
key, private key pair.

00:30:14.716 --> 00:30:16.946 A:middle
The private key belongs to you

00:30:17.086 --> 00:30:18.886 A:middle
and will be used to add a unique

00:30:18.886 --> 00:30:20.296 A:middle
signature to your token.

00:30:20.836 --> 00:30:23.886 A:middle
The public key will be used by

00:30:24.036 --> 00:30:26.596 A:middle
Apple to verify that signature

00:30:26.596 --> 00:30:28.426 A:middle
and ensure that it was in fact

00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:30.486 A:middle
signed by the associated private

00:30:30.586 --> 00:30:30.826 A:middle
key.

00:30:31.376 --> 00:30:34.606 A:middle
To create one of the keys,

00:30:34.746 --> 00:30:36.876 A:middle
you'll need to log in to App

00:30:37.086 --> 00:30:39.626 A:middle
Store Connect and navigate to a

00:30:39.626 --> 00:30:41.456 A:middle
new API Keys tab.

00:30:42.756 --> 00:30:45.396 A:middle
Your admin users will be able to

00:30:45.396 --> 00:30:47.216 A:middle
manage your team's API Keys.

00:30:47.926 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
You can create new Keys and

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:51.106 A:middle
revoke them when they're no

00:30:51.106 --> 00:30:51.816 A:middle
longer needed.

00:30:52.386 --> 00:30:54.996 A:middle
Each key will need to be

00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:56.576 A:middle
assigned a level of access and

00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:59.886 A:middle
this will determine what API

00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:01.446 A:middle
services the key can be used
