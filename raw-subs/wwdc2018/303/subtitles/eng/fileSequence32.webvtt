00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:00.956 A:middle
Once you have your private key

00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:03.026 A:middle
file, you'll be ready to start

00:32:03.026 --> 00:32:04.836 A:middle
generating JSON web tokens.

00:32:05.896 --> 00:32:07.166 A:middle
Now each of these tokens will

00:32:07.166 --> 00:32:08.916 A:middle
need to contain a few pieces of

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:09.676 A:middle
information.

00:32:10.906 --> 00:32:12.246 A:middle
First, you'll need to add your

00:32:12.246 --> 00:32:14.246 A:middle
Issuer ID, that's your account

00:32:14.326 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
identifier, and this ID can be

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:18.896 A:middle
found at the top of that new

00:32:18.946 --> 00:32:19.416 A:middle
page.

00:32:20.946 --> 00:32:22.726 A:middle
You'll also need to find or

00:32:22.726 --> 00:32:24.176 A:middle
you'll also need to add the ID

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:25.086 A:middle
of your key.

00:32:25.786 --> 00:32:28.596 A:middle
This ID can also be found on

00:32:28.596 --> 00:32:31.526 A:middle
this new page and it is specific

00:32:31.526 --> 00:32:33.246 A:middle
to the key that you'll be using.

00:32:33.786 --> 00:32:37.836 A:middle
Now each token will also need an

00:32:37.836 --> 00:32:39.126 A:middle
expiration timestamp.

00:32:39.466 --> 00:32:41.886 A:middle
As I mentioned before, your keys

00:32:41.886 --> 00:32:44.236 A:middle
do not expire but these tokens

00:32:44.236 --> 00:32:45.816 A:middle
can only be used for up to 20

00:32:45.816 --> 00:32:46.036 A:middle
minutes.

00:32:46.036 --> 00:32:49.056 A:middle
And the last two pieces of

00:32:49.056 --> 00:32:51.166 A:middle
information are simply constant.

00:32:51.846 --> 00:32:54.106 A:middle
By that, I mean they will remain

00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:56.576 A:middle
the same across all tokens and

00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:58.706 A:middle
for all App Store Connect APIs,

00:32:59.186 --> 00:33:00.906 A:middle
