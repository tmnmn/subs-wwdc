00:32:59.186 --> 00:33:00.906 A:middle
the first is the Audience for

00:33:00.906 --> 00:33:02.466 A:middle
the token and that will always

00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:03.736 A:middle
be App Store Connect.

00:33:04.206 --> 00:33:07.036 A:middle
And finally, you'll need to

00:33:07.036 --> 00:33:09.976 A:middle
assign or you'll need to add the

00:33:09.976 --> 00:33:12.076 A:middle
algorithm that was used to sign

00:33:12.076 --> 00:33:12.666 A:middle
the token.

00:33:13.096 --> 00:33:15.976 A:middle
And for this, we have chosen to

00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:16.686 A:middle
use ES256.

00:33:17.406 --> 00:33:19.006 A:middle
Now this algorithm corresponds

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:21.256 A:middle
to a JWT-supported algorithm

00:33:21.626 --> 00:33:23.346 A:middle
that we have chosen to have you

00:33:23.346 --> 00:33:25.256 A:middle
use but don't worry, you don't

00:33:25.256 --> 00:33:26.826 A:middle
need to implement this

00:33:26.826 --> 00:33:27.596 A:middle
algorithm.

00:33:28.216 --> 00:33:30.326 A:middle
Fortunately, JWT provides

00:33:30.786 --> 00:33:32.486 A:middle
multiple libraries across

00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:34.556 A:middle
virtually any language that

00:33:34.556 --> 00:33:36.056 A:middle
makes creating and signing these

00:33:36.136 --> 00:33:37.866 A:middle
tokens as easy as possible.

00:33:39.066 --> 00:33:40.816 A:middle
This example behind me is

00:33:40.816 --> 00:33:42.676 A:middle
written in Ruby and, as you can

00:33:42.736 --> 00:33:45.026 A:middle
see, all I need to do is pass in

00:33:45.026 --> 00:33:46.686 A:middle
these few pieces of information

00:33:47.046 --> 00:33:48.726 A:middle
along with my private key and

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:50.856 A:middle
this encode method returns to me

00:33:50.856 --> 00:33:52.376 A:middle
a complete and signed token.

00:33:53.696 --> 00:33:56.706 A:middle
That token can then be added to

00:33:56.706 --> 00:33:59.586 A:middle
my request by simply placing it

00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:00.806 A:middle
inside of an authorization
