00:35:58.426 --> 00:36:02.456 A:middle
So if we pull up the terminal, I

00:36:02.456 --> 00:36:06.226 A:middle
can curl that apps endpoint.

00:36:06.226 --> 00:36:08.566 A:middle
And as we expected, we get that

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:09.576 A:middle
401 response.

00:36:09.576 --> 00:36:10.976 A:middle
So let's call my script.

00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:19.536 A:middle
And I get a new token.

00:36:20.126 --> 00:36:22.496 A:middle
So I can take that token and add

00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:23.966 A:middle
it to my request

00:36:28.996 --> 00:36:30.366 A:middle
by putting it in an

00:36:30.926 --> 00:36:31.876 A:middle
authorization header.

00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:32.976 A:middle
Make sure I spelled that right.

00:36:38.036 --> 00:36:39.626 A:middle
And I get back the list of my

00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:39.976 A:middle
apps.

00:36:45.816 --> 00:36:47.896 A:middle
So as you can see, with just a

00:36:47.896 --> 00:36:50.646 A:middle
few easy steps I was able to get

00:36:50.646 --> 00:36:52.366 A:middle
access to the API and start

00:36:52.366 --> 00:36:53.376 A:middle
getting back real data.

00:36:53.376 --> 00:36:54.466 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:54.466 --> 00:36:54.966 A:middle
Back to Geoff.
