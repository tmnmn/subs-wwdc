00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.226 A:middle
That's just standard REST

00:10:01.286 --> 00:10:02.316 A:middle
behavior to tell you that the

00:10:02.316 --> 00:10:03.506 A:middle
resource was successfully

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:03.976 A:middle
created.

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:06.976 A:middle
And we also include the full

00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:08.446 A:middle
resource information in the

00:10:08.446 --> 00:10:10.086 A:middle
response data and this is

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.336 A:middle
important for two reasons.

00:10:11.606 --> 00:10:13.656 A:middle
First, it gives you the ID and

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.736 A:middle
the resource self link of the

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:17.396 A:middle
resource that was created, which

00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:18.426 A:middle
is stuff you're probably going

00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:19.676 A:middle
to need later so you can come

00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:21.136 A:middle
back and operate on this

00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:21.676 A:middle
resource.

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:23.816 A:middle
And also if you look at the

00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:25.286 A:middle
attributes, you may see

00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:27.076 A:middle
attributes in this response that

00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:28.686 A:middle
you didn't include in the POST.

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:30.636 A:middle
For example with user

00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:32.036 A:middle
invitations, Apple will assign

00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:34.056 A:middle
an expiration Date to every user

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:35.166 A:middle
invitation you create.

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:37.106 A:middle
Now you don't set that, so you

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:38.416 A:middle
don't include it in the POST.

00:10:38.656 --> 00:10:39.746 A:middle
And that's why this response

00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:41.296 A:middle
data is really important to you.

00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:42.346 A:middle
It shows you the complete

00:10:42.346 --> 00:10:44.376 A:middle
picture of this resource after

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:46.166 A:middle
it's been created and all of our

00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:48.966 A:middle
rules have been applied to it.

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:50.496 A:middle
Now if this user accepts,

00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:51.746 A:middle
they'll become a user on our

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:52.126 A:middle
team.

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:53.846 A:middle
And suppose we want to come back

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:55.656 A:middle
later and modify them in some

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:57.116 A:middle
way, like for instance you can

00:10:57.116 --> 00:10:58.356 A:middle
see from the attributes here

00:10:58.356 --> 00:10:59.726 A:middle
this user has the developer

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:00.066 A:middle
role.
