00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.076 A:middle
Transporter and it can use those

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:00.976 A:middle
for authentication as well.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:04.206 A:middle
It just makes the process easier

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:04.956 A:middle
to manage for you.

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:08.066 A:middle
Okay, we have a whole bunch to

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:08.466 A:middle
get through.

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:09.536 A:middle
We're going to go kind of fast

00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:09.826 A:middle
today.

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:11.276 A:middle
I apologize for that but we have

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:11.936 A:middle
a lot to cover.

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:12.746 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:14.286 A:middle
getting data and changing data

00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:14.856 A:middle
with the API.

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:16.596 A:middle
We'll talk about relationships

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:17.686 A:middle
which is how the different parts

00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:19.386 A:middle
of the API fit together and how

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.296 A:middle
you work with those.

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:21.626 A:middle
We'll talk about how to handle

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:23.256 A:middle
errors, how to get access to the

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.436 A:middle
API and authenticate your

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:26.046 A:middle
request, then we'll wrap up with

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:27.066 A:middle
some best practices.

00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:29.446 A:middle
So, you ready to get started?

00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:33.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:35.646 A:middle
So like I said, we're going to

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:36.766 A:middle
start with getting data and that

00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:37.906 A:middle
means we start right here,

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:40.996 A:middle
api.appstoreconnect.apple.com.

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:42.966 A:middle
This is the home base of the API

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.336 A:middle
and from here we want to

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:45.586 A:middle
construct a URL.

00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:48.126 A:middle
First we will add a version.

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:50.356 A:middle
Now all API endpoints have a

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:51.566 A:middle
version and right now that's

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:51.976 A:middle
always v1.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.216 A:middle
But inevitably as App Store

00:05:54.216 --> 00:05:55.936 A:middle
Connect grows and changes over

00:05:55.936 --> 00:05:57.536 A:middle
time, we'll have to make changes

00:05:57.536 --> 00:05:59.056 A:middle
to the API that might cause your

00:05:59.056 --> 00:06:00.116 A:middle
code to stop working.
