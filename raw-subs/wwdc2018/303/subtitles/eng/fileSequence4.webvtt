00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:01.436 A:middle
And as we announced yesterday,

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:02.516 A:middle
this includes your complete

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:04.426 A:middle
unified user base across

00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:06.606 A:middle
developer website and App Store

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:06.976 A:middle
Connect.

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:08.736 A:middle
So you have one set of users and

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:09.696 A:middle
one set of roles.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:15.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:17.596 A:middle
We have provisioning APIs that

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:19.226 A:middle
let you add development devices

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.866 A:middle
and register bundle IDs and

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:22.065 A:middle
manage your certificates and

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:24.196 A:middle
profiles, and then we have

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.536 A:middle
reports APIs that let you

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.136 A:middle
download the sales and financial

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:27.786 A:middle
report files.

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:29.576 A:middle
And if you use the Reporter tool

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:30.896 A:middle
today, this will feel really

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:31.806 A:middle
familiar to you because the

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.236 A:middle
parameters you send to Reporter

00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:34.626 A:middle
are very similar to the ones you

00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:35.376 A:middle
send to the API.

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:36.966 A:middle
So it's really easy to make the

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:37.456 A:middle
switch.

00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:39.776 A:middle
And I said there were four

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:41.366 A:middle
things and this last part isn't

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:42.856 A:middle
really part of the API itself

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:43.836 A:middle
but I wanted to bring it up

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:44.906 A:middle
because it's an important part

00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:46.116 A:middle
of our automation story.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:47.756 A:middle
We've made a couple of important

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:49.006 A:middle
changes the Transporter to help

00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:50.326 A:middle
smooth all of this out for you.

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.186 A:middle
First of all, Transporter will

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:53.256 A:middle
officially be supported on

00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:53.706 A:middle
Linux.

00:04:54.436 --> 00:04:56.126 A:middle
And also, you can take the API

00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:58.116 A:middle
tokens that you use for the new

00:04:58.116 --> 00:04:59.296 A:middle
API and send those through to

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.076 A:middle
Transporter and it can use those
