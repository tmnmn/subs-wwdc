00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:00.816 A:middle
of beta Groups and a set of

00:21:00.816 --> 00:21:01.366 A:middle
attributes.

00:21:01.366 --> 00:21:03.296 A:middle
And since the name is the only

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.696 A:middle
required field when we're

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.516 A:middle
creating a group, let's give it

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.776 A:middle
a name and we'll simply call it

00:21:09.116 --> 00:21:09.606 A:middle
Test Group.

00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:11.866 A:middle
And I'll send the request now

00:21:12.566 --> 00:21:15.136 A:middle
and we get a 409 CONFLICT

00:21:15.136 --> 00:21:15.636 A:middle
response.

00:21:15.936 --> 00:21:18.316 A:middle
So let's look at the details.

00:21:18.606 --> 00:21:19.686 A:middle
It says, "You must provide a

00:21:19.686 --> 00:21:21.106 A:middle
value for the relationship app

00:21:21.386 --> 00:21:22.106 A:middle
with this request."

00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:24.266 A:middle
So in TestFlight, you cannot

00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:25.746 A:middle
create a beta Group that does

00:21:25.746 --> 00:21:27.486 A:middle
not belong to any app and, thus,

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:28.916 A:middle
we must create a relationship to

00:21:28.916 --> 00:21:30.366 A:middle
an app while we're creating beta

00:21:30.366 --> 00:21:30.726 A:middle
Group.

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:31.946 A:middle
And how do we do this?

00:21:32.296 --> 00:21:33.666 A:middle
We can include the relationship

00:21:33.666 --> 00:21:37.496 A:middle
in the payload like this.

00:21:37.676 --> 00:21:38.836 A:middle
So now we have the relationship

00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:40.936 A:middle
in the payload of an app with a

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:42.926 A:middle
data type of apps and the id

00:21:43.006 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
specifies which apps the beta

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:46.396 A:middle
Groups should be linked to.

00:21:46.676 --> 00:21:48.006 A:middle
So this will create beta Groups

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:49.546 A:middle
with the name of Test Group and

00:21:49.546 --> 00:21:52.436 A:middle
link to an app with the id.

00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:53.936 A:middle
So let's resend this request.

00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:56.506 A:middle
And now we get a 201 CREATED

00:21:56.506 --> 00:21:56.876 A:middle
response.

00:21:57.356 --> 00:21:58.796 A:middle
In the response, we have the id

00:21:58.946 --> 00:21:59.846 A:middle
that is generated.

00:21:59.846 --> 00:22:04.006 A:middle
So let's copy this id.
