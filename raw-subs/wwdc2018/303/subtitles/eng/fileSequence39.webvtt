00:38:59.856 --> 00:39:01.196 A:middle
the link we gave you out of the

00:39:01.196 --> 00:39:03.076 A:middle
response and use it for the next

00:39:03.076 --> 00:39:03.886 A:middle
part of the process.

00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:05.546 A:middle
This will help you in two ways.

00:39:05.686 --> 00:39:07.336 A:middle
One, it makes your code more

00:39:07.336 --> 00:39:08.726 A:middle
generically applicable to

00:39:08.726 --> 00:39:09.856 A:middle
different parts of the API.

00:39:09.856 --> 00:39:11.946 A:middle
And two, when that inevitable v2

00:39:11.946 --> 00:39:13.816 A:middle
API comes along, this will

00:39:13.816 --> 00:39:14.966 A:middle
reduce the amount of work you

00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:16.516 A:middle
have to do to adjust to the

00:39:16.516 --> 00:39:17.036 A:middle
changes.

00:39:18.406 --> 00:39:19.516 A:middle
And finally, I want to talk

00:39:19.516 --> 00:39:20.606 A:middle
about the documentation.

00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:23.096 A:middle
We've talked about the

00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:24.786 A:middle
consistency of this API today

00:39:24.786 --> 00:39:26.016 A:middle
and we really focused on that.

00:39:26.016 --> 00:39:27.486 A:middle
And so any time a resource can

00:39:27.486 --> 00:39:28.966 A:middle
do something, it will do it in

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.426 A:middle
the same way as all the other

00:39:30.426 --> 00:39:32.216 A:middle
resources but of course not

00:39:32.216 --> 00:39:33.436 A:middle
every resource can do

00:39:33.436 --> 00:39:34.226 A:middle
everything.

00:39:34.596 --> 00:39:35.566 A:middle
You already saw an example of

00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:36.396 A:middle
this with users.

00:39:36.396 --> 00:39:37.716 A:middle
We had to create an invitation.

00:39:37.806 --> 00:39:39.426 A:middle
There's no API to create a user.

00:39:39.856 --> 00:39:41.066 A:middle
So the documentation is how you

00:39:41.066 --> 00:39:41.736 A:middle
figure this out.

00:39:41.906 --> 00:39:43.496 A:middle
It tells you what the resource

00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:45.046 A:middle
can do, what operations are

00:39:45.046 --> 00:39:46.346 A:middle
available, what parameters it

00:39:46.346 --> 00:39:47.636 A:middle
supports, and so forth.

00:39:48.176 --> 00:39:50.376 A:middle
And that's the App Store Connect

00:39:50.376 --> 00:39:50.686 A:middle
API.

00:39:51.326 --> 00:39:52.116 A:middle
It's a consistent

00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:53.536 A:middle
standards-based REST API.

00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:55.146 A:middle
We're really excited about it.

00:39:55.146 --> 00:39:57.256 A:middle
And one thing that we love about

00:39:57.256 --> 00:39:59.146 A:middle
this API is that we designed it

00:39:59.336 --> 00:40:00.616 A:middle
to be really flexible so that
