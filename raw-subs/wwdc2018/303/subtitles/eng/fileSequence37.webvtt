[ Applause ]

00:37:02.296 --> 00:37:02.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:37:02.896 --> 00:37:03.476 A:middle
Thanks, Julie.

00:37:04.626 --> 00:37:05.976 A:middle
Pretty cool, huh?

00:37:06.466 --> 00:37:07.856 A:middle
So that's access and

00:37:07.856 --> 00:37:08.666 A:middle
authentication.

00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:09.976 A:middle
And now in the few minutes that

00:37:09.976 --> 00:37:11.046 A:middle
we have remaining, I want to

00:37:11.046 --> 00:37:12.446 A:middle
talk about some best practices

00:37:12.446 --> 00:37:13.346 A:middle
when using the API.

00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:15.576 A:middle
We're going to start with those

00:37:15.576 --> 00:37:15.956 A:middle
keys.

00:37:16.146 --> 00:37:17.716 A:middle
Now as Julie said, those keys

00:37:17.716 --> 00:37:19.496 A:middle
belong to you and it's your job

00:37:19.496 --> 00:37:20.266 A:middle
to protect them.

00:37:20.536 --> 00:37:22.176 A:middle
Anybody who has the keys can

00:37:22.176 --> 00:37:23.066 A:middle
access your data.

00:37:23.496 --> 00:37:24.806 A:middle
So ideally, you're going to put

00:37:24.806 --> 00:37:26.116 A:middle
those keys in some kind of a

00:37:26.116 --> 00:37:27.966 A:middle
secure key store and your code

00:37:27.966 --> 00:37:29.676 A:middle
will check them out, use them in

00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:31.126 A:middle
memory, and never store them

00:37:31.126 --> 00:37:32.696 A:middle
anywhere, like in a database or

00:37:32.696 --> 00:37:33.306 A:middle
on disc.

00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:34.946 A:middle
If you do have to store the keys

00:37:34.946 --> 00:37:36.536 A:middle
on disc, make sure you check

00:37:36.576 --> 00:37:37.706 A:middle
your file system permissions

00:37:37.706 --> 00:37:38.536 A:middle
very carefully.

00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:40.156 A:middle
And, of course, if you have any

00:37:40.156 --> 00:37:41.506 A:middle
reason to think a key has been

00:37:41.506 --> 00:37:42.626 A:middle
compromised in some way,

00:37:42.936 --> 00:37:44.336 A:middle
immediately log in to App Store

00:37:44.336 --> 00:37:47.256 A:middle
Connect and revoke that key.

00:37:47.436 --> 00:37:48.306 A:middle
I also want to talk about the

00:37:48.386 --> 00:37:50.586 A:middle
tokens that you create from your

00:37:50.586 --> 00:37:51.006 A:middle
keys.

00:37:51.006 --> 00:37:51.986 A:middle
Now there's no reason that you

00:37:51.986 --> 00:37:53.186 A:middle
have to send a different token

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:54.206 A:middle
with every request.

00:37:54.426 --> 00:37:55.186 A:middle
In fact, you'll get better

00:37:55.186 --> 00:37:56.956 A:middle
performance in your code and on

00:37:56.956 --> 00:37:58.676 A:middle
our end if you reuse those

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.136 A:middle
tokens over and over again.
