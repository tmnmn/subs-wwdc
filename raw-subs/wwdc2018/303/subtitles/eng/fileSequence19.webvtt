00:18:59.006 --> 00:19:00.616 A:middle
testers relationship in the

00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:02.316 A:middle
first group, you see this new

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:03.376 A:middle
section called data.

00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:06.046 A:middle
And this has the type and id

00:19:06.086 --> 00:19:07.966 A:middle
pairs of the testers in this

00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:08.246 A:middle
group.

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:09.736 A:middle
Now if you could see the whole

00:19:09.736 --> 00:19:11.006 A:middle
response here, you'd see a data

00:19:11.006 --> 00:19:12.706 A:middle
section like this inside each

00:19:12.706 --> 00:19:14.856 A:middle
beta testers relationship inside

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.736 A:middle
each group that's in this array,

00:19:17.376 --> 00:19:17.586 A:middle
right.

00:19:18.216 --> 00:19:19.616 A:middle
But this is just the type and

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:19.806 A:middle
IDs.

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:20.606 A:middle
I'm sure you're wondering where

00:19:20.606 --> 00:19:21.876 A:middle
the actual tester information

00:19:21.876 --> 00:19:22.066 A:middle
is.

00:19:22.316 --> 00:19:23.426 A:middle
And if we scroll all the way

00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:24.646 A:middle
down to the end of this

00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:26.236 A:middle
response, we also have a new

00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:27.466 A:middle
section called include.

00:19:28.156 --> 00:19:29.506 A:middle
And this is an array of beta

00:19:29.506 --> 00:19:30.986 A:middle
testers with the full tester

00:19:30.986 --> 00:19:31.646 A:middle
information.

00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:33.396 A:middle
More generally the include

00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:35.696 A:middle
section has a full resource

00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:37.606 A:middle
representation of every resource

00:19:37.646 --> 00:19:39.636 A:middle
that you have included by way of

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:40.456 A:middle
relationships.

00:19:40.796 --> 00:19:42.616 A:middle
And then we can match by type

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:44.706 A:middle
and id, figure out which testers

00:19:45.006 --> 00:19:46.056 A:middle
belong to which group.

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.936 A:middle
Now you might be wondering why

00:19:48.936 --> 00:19:49.586 A:middle
we do this.

00:19:49.586 --> 00:19:50.876 A:middle
We have the data section with

00:19:50.876 --> 00:19:52.276 A:middle
all of our groups and then we

00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:53.436 A:middle
have the include section with

00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:54.816 A:middle
all of our included testers.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:56.096 A:middle
And we do this for an important

00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:56.406 A:middle
reason.

00:19:56.406 --> 00:19:57.576 A:middle
We have this test on the screen

00:19:57.576 --> 00:19:59.476 A:middle
John Appleseed and that tester

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:00.756 A:middle
might be in multiple groups,
