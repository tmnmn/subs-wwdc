00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:01.926 A:middle
And we have the two testers that

00:25:01.926 --> 00:25:03.426 A:middle
are added to this beta Groups.

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:12.086 A:middle
So in this demo, we saw how to

00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:13.506 A:middle
create beta Groups and beta

00:25:13.506 --> 00:25:15.286 A:middle
testers and so some relationship

00:25:15.286 --> 00:25:16.486 A:middle
between testers and groups.

00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:18.696 A:middle
And this concludes the demo on

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.086 A:middle
How to Use App Store Connect API

00:25:20.306 --> 00:25:20.946 A:middle
with TestFlight.

00:25:20.946 --> 00:25:22.316 A:middle
And I'll give the stage back to

00:25:22.316 --> 00:25:22.566 A:middle
Geoff.

00:25:22.616 --> 00:25:22.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:29.386 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:29.886 --> 00:25:30.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks again, Sehoon.

00:25:30.706 --> 00:25:31.476 A:middle
That was awesome.

00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:36.746 A:middle
So that's getting data, changing

00:25:36.746 --> 00:25:37.996 A:middle
data, and relationships.

00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:38.986 A:middle
It kind of covers the basic

00:25:38.986 --> 00:25:39.976 A:middle
features of the API.

00:25:40.566 --> 00:25:41.736 A:middle
But as you saw a glimpse in

00:25:41.736 --> 00:25:43.446 A:middle
Sehoon's demo, sometimes you

00:25:43.446 --> 00:25:44.806 A:middle
make mistakes and we can't

00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:45.916 A:middle
process your request.

00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:47.166 A:middle
So we're going to shift gears

00:25:47.166 --> 00:25:48.616 A:middle
now and talk about how the API

00:25:48.836 --> 00:25:50.576 A:middle
communicates these errors back

00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:51.036 A:middle
to you.

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:53.636 A:middle
Anytime a request fails, you'll

00:25:53.636 --> 00:25:54.736 A:middle
get a response that looks like

00:25:54.736 --> 00:25:55.076 A:middle
this.

00:25:56.536 --> 00:25:58.546 A:middle
Now the first thing to notice is

00:25:58.546 --> 00:25:59.286 A:middle
that we'll send back an

00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:01.416 A:middle
appropriate HTTP response status
