00:07:58.286 --> 00:08:00.016 A:middle
Now this is a URL that uniquely

00:08:00.016 --> 00:08:01.336 A:middle
identifies this particular

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:03.226 A:middle
resource, in this case the first

00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:04.736 A:middle
user in the result here.

00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:06.246 A:middle
Every resource we send back to

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:08.066 A:middle
you includes this resource self

00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:08.306 A:middle
link.

00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:10.846 A:middle
It always looks like this:

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:13.476 A:middle
api.appstoreconnect.apple.com

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.206 A:middle
and then the version, v1, and

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:17.316 A:middle
then the resource type, users,

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:19.246 A:middle
and then the identifier of that

00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:19.746 A:middle
resource.

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:22.006 A:middle
And you can go get it and you

00:08:22.006 --> 00:08:23.236 A:middle
get back data that looks almost

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.636 A:middle
exactly like what we just saw.

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:26.306 A:middle
The only difference here is

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:27.796 A:middle
we're seeing just this one user

00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:29.726 A:middle
now instead of all the users on

00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:30.256 A:middle
your team.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:34.145 A:middle
So that's two ways to get data.

00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:36.405 A:middle
You get a list of resources or

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:37.916 A:middle
an individual resource, but of

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:38.696 A:middle
course you're going to want to

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:40.186 A:middle
change data as well.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.216 A:middle
And to do that, we lean on

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:44.246 A:middle
common REST conventions, so this

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:45.826 A:middle
will also feel familiar to a lot

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:46.136 A:middle
of you.

00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:47.976 A:middle
You've already seen how to get

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:48.556 A:middle
resources.

00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:50.846 A:middle
To create a new resource, you'll

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:52.726 A:middle
use the http POST method.

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:54.826 A:middle
To change a resource, you'll use

00:08:54.876 --> 00:08:57.036 A:middle
PATCH, and to delete a resource,

00:08:57.266 --> 00:08:58.536 A:middle
you'll use the DELETE method.

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.336 A:middle
So let's try this.
