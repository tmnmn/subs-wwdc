00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:00.346 A:middle
be secure.

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:02.376 A:middle
So we use industry-standard JSON

00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:04.686 A:middle
web tokens for authentication.

00:02:04.746 --> 00:02:06.006 A:middle
And that just means you don't

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.136 A:middle
have to pass usernames and

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:09.205 A:middle
passwords around, and you don't

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:10.395 A:middle
have to have your code tied to

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.506 A:middle
any specific person on your team

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.206 A:middle
but you still maintain control

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:15.796 A:middle
of who can access your data and

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:16.506 A:middle
what they can do.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.866 A:middle
From an ease-of-use standpoint,

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.256 A:middle
we focus really closely on

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:22.606 A:middle
consistency with this API.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.096 A:middle
We have a single unified REST

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:27.006 A:middle
resource model, which just means

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:28.416 A:middle
that you can take what you learn

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:29.996 A:middle
in any one part of the API and

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:31.716 A:middle
apply it to every other part.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.136 A:middle
And we've also built

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:34.736 A:middle
discoverability into the API

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:37.066 A:middle
itself, in simple ways like when

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.956 A:middle
we return JSON data to you, it's

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:40.826 A:middle
nicely formatted and indented so

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.066 A:middle
if you need to, you can dump it

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:43.516 A:middle
out to the console and read it

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.076 A:middle
right on the screen and we

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:46.046 A:middle
include links and those

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:48.046 A:middle
responses to related information

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:49.166 A:middle
to help you figure out how the

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.296 A:middle
parts fit together.

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:53.286 A:middle
And, of course, the API will be

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:54.256 A:middle
fully documented.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:55.266 A:middle
If you haven't seen this

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:56.546 A:middle
already, the documentation

00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:58.186 A:middle
platform that you already use at

00:02:58.186 --> 00:03:00.706 A:middle
developer.apple.com and in Xcode
