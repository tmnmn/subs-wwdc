developer.apple.com and in Xcode

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.796 A:middle
was extended this year to also

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.226 A:middle
include Apple's REST APIs.

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:05.926 A:middle
So the same format you're

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.166 A:middle
familiar with your framework

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:08.946 A:middle
docs will apply to the App Store

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:10.226 A:middle
Connect API as well.

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:14.466 A:middle
Now we started with a focus on

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:15.716 A:middle
the areas of App Store Connect

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:18.166 A:middle
that don't already have an

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:19.606 A:middle
automation story and that you

00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
have to visit over and over

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:21.986 A:middle
again and in particular we're

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:23.656 A:middle
starting with these four areas

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:24.566 A:middle
you see here.

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:25.866 A:middle
So let's look at what all is

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:26.416 A:middle
included.

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:28.326 A:middle
First, we have comprehensive

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:29.286 A:middle
coverage of TestFlight.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:30.896 A:middle
You can manage your testers and

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:31.296 A:middle
groups.

00:03:31.436 --> 00:03:32.676 A:middle
You can submit your builds for

00:03:32.676 --> 00:03:33.176 A:middle
review.

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:34.586 A:middle
And if you saw the session

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:35.726 A:middle
yesterday, the What's New in App

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:36.946 A:middle
Store Connect Session, you know

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:38.166 A:middle
we just announced a new public

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:39.706 A:middle
links feature for tester

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:40.376 A:middle
acquisition.

00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:42.176 A:middle
And this works hand-in-hand with

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:42.526 A:middle
the API.

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:44.946 A:middle
You can use the API to manage

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:46.466 A:middle
your public links and you can

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.716 A:middle
use the two of them together to

00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:49.286 A:middle
run your beta test program in

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:51.096 A:middle
whatever way works best for you.

00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:54.206 A:middle
On the Users and Roles side, you

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:55.836 A:middle
can add and remove users and

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:56.876 A:middle
keep the permissions on your

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:58.676 A:middle
users in sync with your actual

00:03:58.676 --> 00:03:59.446 A:middle
organization.
