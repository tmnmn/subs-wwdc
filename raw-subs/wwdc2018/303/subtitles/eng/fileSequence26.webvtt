00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:01.416 A:middle
appropriate HTTP response status

00:26:01.976 --> 00:26:03.256 A:middle
indicating what went wrong,

00:26:03.356 --> 00:26:04.866 A:middle
usually something in the 400s.

00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:06.286 A:middle
And this is often all you really

00:26:06.286 --> 00:26:06.596 A:middle
need.

00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:08.256 A:middle
Most REST client libraries have

00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:10.136 A:middle
a Did Succeed or it Is Success

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:11.716 A:middle
function and you can call that

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:13.096 A:middle
and it will correctly tell you

00:26:13.096 --> 00:26:14.806 A:middle
if the request was successful or

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:15.016 A:middle
not.

00:26:15.516 --> 00:26:16.656 A:middle
But if you want to know more

00:26:16.656 --> 00:26:18.036 A:middle
about what went wrong, you can

00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:19.416 A:middle
look down into the response.

00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:21.416 A:middle
When a request fails, instead of

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:22.756 A:middle
that data property we've been

00:26:22.756 --> 00:26:24.246 A:middle
seeing all along, we'll give you

00:26:24.246 --> 00:26:25.316 A:middle
an error's property.

00:26:25.546 --> 00:26:26.856 A:middle
This is an array of error

00:26:26.856 --> 00:26:27.376 A:middle
objects.

00:26:27.746 --> 00:26:28.876 A:middle
But there can be multiple of

00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:30.706 A:middle
them, each one representing some

00:26:30.706 --> 00:26:31.986 A:middle
problem with the request you

00:26:31.986 --> 00:26:32.326 A:middle
sent.

00:26:33.456 --> 00:26:35.206 A:middle
They have an id that uniquely

00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:36.786 A:middle
identifies this particular error

00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:38.456 A:middle
of this particular response.

00:26:38.726 --> 00:26:40.586 A:middle
You might log this away and if

00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:41.416 A:middle
you think there's a problem on

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:42.446 A:middle
our end, send it to us.

00:26:42.446 --> 00:26:43.706 A:middle
It'll help us track it down.

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:46.336 A:middle
More useful for you is the title

00:26:46.336 --> 00:26:46.986 A:middle
and detail.

00:26:47.496 --> 00:26:48.606 A:middle
These together give you an

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:50.556 A:middle
English language explanation of

00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:51.266 A:middle
what went wrong.

00:26:51.536 --> 00:26:52.716 A:middle
From the title here, I can see

00:26:52.716 --> 00:26:53.596 A:middle
that I have something wrong with

00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:54.366 A:middle
my parameters.

00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:56.766 A:middle
And from the detail, it tells me

00:26:56.766 --> 00:26:58.106 A:middle
that I'm filtering by email and

00:26:58.106 --> 00:26:59.556 A:middle
right away I see that I spelled

00:26:59.556 --> 00:27:00.716 A:middle
email incorrectly.
