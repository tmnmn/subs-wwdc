00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:01.446 A:middle
services the key can be used

00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:01.726 A:middle
for.

00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:05.466 A:middle
Once created, new keys will

00:31:05.466 --> 00:31:07.366 A:middle
appear in this list and the

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.186 A:middle
private key file, that's the

00:31:09.186 --> 00:31:10.976 A:middle
part that belongs to you, will

00:31:10.976 --> 00:31:12.396 A:middle
be available to download.

00:31:13.726 --> 00:31:15.796 A:middle
Now it's important to note that

00:31:16.066 --> 00:31:17.936 A:middle
each private key can only be

00:31:17.936 --> 00:31:18.886 A:middle
downloaded once.

00:31:19.846 --> 00:31:21.436 A:middle
That is because these keys are

00:31:21.436 --> 00:31:22.766 A:middle
not stored by Apple.

00:31:23.296 --> 00:31:25.676 A:middle
In fact, your key is not even

00:31:25.676 --> 00:31:27.926 A:middle
generated until the moment you

00:31:27.926 --> 00:31:29.026 A:middle
decide to download it.

00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:31.836 A:middle
So you can think of these keys

00:31:31.836 --> 00:31:32.826 A:middle
like real keys.

00:31:33.486 --> 00:31:35.306 A:middle
They belong to you and they must

00:31:35.346 --> 00:31:39.176 A:middle
be managed and protected by you.

00:31:39.386 --> 00:31:42.766 A:middle
Also much like real keys, these

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:45.386 A:middle
keys do not expire, so if the

00:31:45.386 --> 00:31:47.486 A:middle
key is lost or stolen it will

00:31:47.486 --> 00:31:49.456 A:middle
continue to have access to your

00:31:50.096 --> 00:31:51.706 A:middle
data until it is revoked through

00:31:51.706 --> 00:31:52.506 A:middle
App Store Connect.

00:31:53.516 --> 00:31:55.106 A:middle
So for this reason, it is very

00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:57.066 A:middle
important to keep your keys safe

00:31:57.066 --> 00:31:57.716 A:middle
and secure.

00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:00.956 A:middle
Once you have your private key
