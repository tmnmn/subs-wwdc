00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:00.106 A:middle
available.

00:29:00.706 --> 00:29:01.976 A:middle
And when you're ready to start

00:29:01.976 --> 00:29:03.226 A:middle
testing out some of these new

00:29:03.226 --> 00:29:05.326 A:middle
features, you might start by

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:07.316 A:middle
sending a simple GET request

00:29:07.316 --> 00:29:10.286 A:middle
like this; however, if you were

00:29:10.286 --> 00:29:12.556 A:middle
to simply curl this endpoint or

00:29:12.726 --> 00:29:13.956 A:middle
type it into your browser,

00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:15.816 A:middle
you'll end up with a response

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:17.196 A:middle
that looks like this.

00:29:18.436 --> 00:29:20.476 A:middle
So as Geoff mentioned, we're

00:29:20.476 --> 00:29:22.456 A:middle
still missing one very important

00:29:22.456 --> 00:29:24.076 A:middle
step stat and that is

00:29:24.406 --> 00:29:25.746 A:middle
authentication credentials.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:29.616 A:middle
Now this step is necessary for

00:29:29.616 --> 00:29:30.586 A:middle
two reasons.

00:29:31.506 --> 00:29:33.776 A:middle
First, authentication

00:29:33.776 --> 00:29:35.526 A:middle
credentials give context to your

00:29:35.526 --> 00:29:35.776 A:middle
request.

00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:38.126 A:middle
After all, you don't want all

00:29:38.296 --> 00:29:38.436 A:middle
apps.

00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:40.606 A:middle
You want your app.

00:29:40.606 --> 00:29:42.876 A:middle
And most importantly, these

00:29:42.876 --> 00:29:45.286 A:middle
credentials secure the API and

00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:47.406 A:middle
ensure that no one but you will

00:29:47.406 --> 00:29:48.656 A:middle
have access to your data.

00:29:49.336 --> 00:29:53.026 A:middle
So to add these credentials to

00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:54.966 A:middle
your request, you'll need to

00:29:54.966 --> 00:29:57.196 A:middle
first create an API Key.

00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
You'll then use that key to
