00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:00.806 A:middle
inside of an authorization

00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:01.086 A:middle
header.

00:34:03.626 --> 00:34:06.006 A:middle
So now that we know how to

00:34:06.006 --> 00:34:08.606 A:middle
create these keys and how to use

00:34:08.606 --> 00:34:10.406 A:middle
these keys to add tokens to our

00:34:10.406 --> 00:34:12.576 A:middle
requests, let's go ahead and

00:34:12.576 --> 00:34:12.976 A:middle
give it a try.

00:34:22.856 --> 00:34:25.025 A:middle
Okay, so here's that new API

00:34:25.025 --> 00:34:27.356 A:middle
Keys page and I don't have any

00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:27.906 A:middle
keys yet.

00:34:28.545 --> 00:34:30.056 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and create one.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:33.466 A:middle
I'll call it demo and I'll have

00:34:33.466 --> 00:34:35.735 A:middle
to assign a level of access.

00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:36.835 A:middle
So here, if I were to choose

00:34:36.835 --> 00:34:39.076 A:middle
something like finance, I'd get

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:40.735 A:middle
a key that has access to things

00:34:40.735 --> 00:34:42.585 A:middle
like financial reports or sales

00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:44.295 A:middle
reports but it won't have access

00:34:44.295 --> 00:34:47.116 A:middle
to things like beta testers or

00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:47.626 A:middle
builds.

00:34:48.106 --> 00:34:50.766 A:middle
I can add on levels of access or

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:52.916 A:middle
I can choose admin and I'll have

00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:54.646 A:middle
a key that has access to all

00:34:54.646 --> 00:34:54.835 A:middle
APIs.

00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:56.366 A:middle
So I'm going to stick with

00:34:56.366 --> 00:34:57.056 A:middle
admin.

00:34:57.056 --> 00:34:59.226 A:middle
And when I generate my key, I

00:34:59.576 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
can see that my private key is
