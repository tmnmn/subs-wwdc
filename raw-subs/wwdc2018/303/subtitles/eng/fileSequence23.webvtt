00:22:58.676 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
endpoint, which is v1/beta

00:23:02.936 --> 00:23:03.616 A:middle
testers.

00:23:04.976 --> 00:23:06.746 A:middle
And we'll also need to provide

00:23:06.746 --> 00:23:08.086 A:middle
the payload that looks like

00:23:08.086 --> 00:23:08.286 A:middle
this.

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.996 A:middle
It has a type of beta testers

00:23:11.126 --> 00:23:12.136 A:middle
and a set of attribute.

00:23:12.326 --> 00:23:13.906 A:middle
So we'll create tester that's

00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:16.396 A:middle
called Kate Bell and this also

00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:18.736 A:middle
has a relationship to the beta

00:23:18.736 --> 00:23:20.266 A:middle
Groups and this will create Beta

00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:22.046 A:middle
Tester and also assign to the

00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:23.226 A:middle
beta Group at the same time.

00:23:24.086 --> 00:23:25.246 A:middle
So if you paste the id of the

00:23:25.246 --> 00:23:27.396 A:middle
beta Group we just created, this

00:23:27.396 --> 00:23:29.396 A:middle
will assign the tester to the

00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:30.056 A:middle
WWDC Group.

00:23:30.056 --> 00:23:33.666 A:middle
And we get a 201 CREATED

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.076 A:middle
response and it looks like the

00:23:35.076 --> 00:23:36.746 A:middle
tester is created and also

00:23:36.746 --> 00:23:37.586 A:middle
assigned to the group at the

00:23:37.586 --> 00:23:38.156 A:middle
same time.

00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:40.526 A:middle
While we're here, let's add one

00:23:40.526 --> 00:23:42.366 A:middle
more tester and all we need to

00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:43.786 A:middle
do is simply replace this

00:23:43.786 --> 00:23:45.646 A:middle
attribute portion with a

00:23:45.646 --> 00:23:48.436 A:middle
different person's name and this

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:50.216 A:middle
will create John Appleseed to

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:52.926 A:middle
the same group.

00:23:54.626 --> 00:23:56.916 A:middle
And again, we get a 201 CREATED

00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:57.456 A:middle
response.

00:23:58.196 --> 00:23:59.766 A:middle
So we just added two testers to

00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:01.796 A:middle
the group and now let's confirm
