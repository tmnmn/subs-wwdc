00:34:59.576 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
can see that my private key is

00:35:00.986 --> 00:35:01.976 A:middle
available to download.

00:35:02.086 --> 00:35:06.386 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, my

00:35:06.386 --> 00:35:07.466 A:middle
private key can only be

00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:08.356 A:middle
downloaded once.

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.706 A:middle
If I lose my key or accidentally

00:35:10.706 --> 00:35:12.276 A:middle
delete it, I can't come back

00:35:12.336 --> 00:35:13.386 A:middle
here to re-download it.

00:35:13.946 --> 00:35:16.026 A:middle
So for that reason, I'm prompted

00:35:16.026 --> 00:35:17.186 A:middle
to make sure that I'm ready to

00:35:17.186 --> 00:35:18.186 A:middle
download this now.

00:35:19.256 --> 00:35:20.796 A:middle
And I am, so let's go ahead and

00:35:20.796 --> 00:35:21.366 A:middle
download.

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:24.816 A:middle
Now that I have my private key

00:35:24.816 --> 00:35:26.806 A:middle
in my Downloads folder, I can

00:35:26.806 --> 00:35:28.586 A:middle
pull up that script we saw

00:35:28.586 --> 00:35:29.046 A:middle
earlier.

00:35:29.046 --> 00:35:31.796 A:middle
And I'll need to copy over my

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:31.976 A:middle
ISSUER ID.

00:35:37.616 --> 00:35:39.126 A:middle
That's the one that's shared

00:35:39.126 --> 00:35:40.416 A:middle
across your API Keys.

00:35:41.026 --> 00:35:43.426 A:middle
And I'll also need to copy that

00:35:43.426 --> 00:35:44.576 A:middle
ID of the private key I just

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:44.976 A:middle
downloaded.

00:35:49.516 --> 00:35:51.326 A:middle
And once I have those IDs in

00:35:51.326 --> 00:35:53.136 A:middle
place, my private key will be

00:35:53.136 --> 00:35:54.676 A:middle
loaded in from my Downloads

00:35:54.726 --> 00:35:55.136 A:middle
folder.

00:35:55.136 --> 00:35:57.106 A:middle
And I'll generate a new token.

00:35:58.426 --> 00:36:02.456 A:middle
So if we pull up the terminal, I
