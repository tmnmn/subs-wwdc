00:54:59.826 --> 00:55:02.836 A:middle
We have built a Bigfoot Finder

00:55:03.356 --> 00:55:07.136 A:middle
and -- that lets us select where

00:55:07.136 --> 00:55:08.806 A:middle
we want to go and tells us where

00:55:08.806 --> 00:55:09.946 A:middle
we are going to go.

00:55:11.016 --> 00:55:12.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:55:12.106 --> 00:55:13.126 A:middle
Thank you.

00:55:16.896 --> 00:55:17.496 A:middle
Quick recap.

00:55:17.936 --> 00:55:19.536 A:middle
We've seen how to react to user

00:55:19.536 --> 00:55:20.106 A:middle
events.

00:55:20.106 --> 00:55:23.256 A:middle
So, in this case, selection and

00:55:23.256 --> 00:55:24.276 A:middle
deselection.

00:55:24.306 --> 00:55:25.826 A:middle
We've got driving directions

00:55:25.826 --> 00:55:27.146 A:middle
from the MapKit JS Service.

00:55:27.486 --> 00:55:29.196 A:middle
We've used polyline overlays to

00:55:29.196 --> 00:55:30.716 A:middle
render these driving directions.

00:55:31.326 --> 00:55:33.766 A:middle
And we've added our own behavior

00:55:33.766 --> 00:55:35.116 A:middle
for the selection of overlays

00:55:35.116 --> 00:55:36.976 A:middle
since there is no specific

00:55:36.976 --> 00:55:38.626 A:middle
behavior provided by default.

00:55:40.416 --> 00:55:42.286 A:middle
So, there is plenty more to talk

00:55:42.286 --> 00:55:45.076 A:middle
about MapKit JS, but we only

00:55:45.076 --> 00:55:45.706 A:middle
have one hour.

00:55:45.826 --> 00:55:47.706 A:middle
So, I will stop here.

00:55:49.426 --> 00:55:52.316 A:middle
But I hope that we have made a

00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:53.796 A:middle
good case for MapKit JS,

00:55:53.796 --> 00:55:55.446 A:middle
delivering a top-notch map

00:55:55.536 --> 00:55:56.816 A:middle
experience for the web.

00:55:58.036 --> 00:56:00.406 A:middle
That it lets you unify on a
