00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:00.046 A:middle
number.

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.006 A:middle
We follow the semantic

00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:05.016 A:middle
versioning system where the

00:09:05.016 --> 00:09:06.276 A:middle
first number is the major

00:09:06.456 --> 00:09:08.716 A:middle
version number, which is updated

00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:09.746 A:middle
if breaking changes are

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:10.336 A:middle
introduced.

00:09:10.676 --> 00:09:12.026 A:middle
The second number is a minor

00:09:12.346 --> 00:09:15.036 A:middle
version number, so when bugs are

00:09:15.036 --> 00:09:16.946 A:middle
fixed, when new features are

00:09:16.946 --> 00:09:18.756 A:middle
added or when performance

00:09:18.756 --> 00:09:20.186 A:middle
improvements take place, we

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:20.996 A:middle
update this number.

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:23.336 A:middle
And finally, for urgent patches,

00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:24.946 A:middle
we update the patch number.

00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:26.806 A:middle
You can specify and X instead of

00:09:26.806 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
a specific number for the minor

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:29.966 A:middle
or the patch version, and we

00:09:30.596 --> 00:09:32.176 A:middle
recommend that you use this

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:34.156 A:middle
Version 5.0.X to get started so

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.996 A:middle
that you will get urgent bug

00:09:35.996 --> 00:09:37.476 A:middle
fixes on our first public

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:37.826 A:middle
release.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:41.406 A:middle
In order to be able to show a

00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:43.806 A:middle
map on your website, you will

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:46.186 A:middle
need to tell your page -- to

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:47.606 A:middle
tell MapKit where to show that

00:09:47.606 --> 00:09:47.776 A:middle
map.

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:50.916 A:middle
So, in order to do that, you can

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:53.646 A:middle
use an HTML element that will be

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:55.156 A:middle
the container for your map.

00:09:55.556 --> 00:09:56.646 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm using a

00:09:56.646 --> 00:09:58.446 A:middle
development which is usually a

00:09:58.446 --> 00:10:01.436 A:middle
very good candidate for that.
