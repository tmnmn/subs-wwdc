So, most of you out there are

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.346 A:middle
probably used to using MapKit

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:05.166 A:middle
inside your apps, and today,

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.086 A:middle
we're making MapKit JS available

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:09.946 A:middle
to you for your websites.

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.296 A:middle
So, this week at WWDC, we're

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:18.656 A:middle
making a MapKit JS Beta

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:20.516 A:middle
available, and this is the same

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:22.156 A:middle
library that we have been using

00:02:22.156 --> 00:02:23.906 A:middle
on our production websites.

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:27.016 A:middle
Every web mapping library out

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.616 A:middle
there, has a free tier of usage.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:31.976 A:middle
Like some number of requests

00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:33.686 A:middle
that you get for free, and

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.586 A:middle
MapKit JS Beta is no different.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.126 A:middle
So, you -- as part of the MapKit

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:40.656 A:middle
JS Beta, you're getting 250,000

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:45.226 A:middle
map initializations, and 25,000

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.246 A:middle
service requests.

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:48.796 A:middle
That includes geocoding, search,

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.606 A:middle
search auto-complete, and

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:51.376 A:middle
directions.

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:54.106 A:middle
And often these free usage tiers

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:55.596 A:middle
are specified over some period

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:58.336 A:middle
of time, like per year, per

00:02:58.336 --> 00:02:59.836 A:middle
month, per week.
