00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.416 A:middle
It also uses something that's

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:02.306 A:middle
called Adaptive Rendering Modes.

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.586 A:middle
So, what that means is, there's

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:05.926 A:middle
a couple different modes in

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:07.166 A:middle
which the map can be rendered.

00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:09.526 A:middle
The first is Client-Side

00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.306 A:middle
Rendering, and this is a full

00:05:11.306 --> 00:05:13.926 A:middle
WebGL engine that is rendering

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:15.236 A:middle
the map on the client.

00:05:15.386 --> 00:05:17.096 A:middle
And this allows us to do lots of

00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:19.166 A:middle
things, like these very, smooth

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:21.386 A:middle
transitions as users pinch to

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:23.556 A:middle
zoom or shift two-finger scroll

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:24.296 A:middle
to zoom in.

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:25.976 A:middle
You'll see the labels fading in

00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:27.836 A:middle
and out as we transition between

00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:28.926 A:middle
zoom levels, just like on

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:29.316 A:middle
native.

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:33.986 A:middle
Also, Client-Side Rendering

00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:35.486 A:middle
gives us full control over the

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:36.306 A:middle
labels on the map.

00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:38.446 A:middle
So, we can enable features such

00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:41.046 A:middle
as Rotation, where I'm rotating

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:42.976 A:middle
the map with two-fingers, but

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:43.916 A:middle
the labels are staying

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:45.606 A:middle
horizontal as I rotate.

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:50.616 A:middle
Finally, with CSR, we have the

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.876 A:middle
marker style annotations that

00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:54.406 A:middle
you're used to seeing on iOS.

00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:57.206 A:middle
And the title of this annotation

00:05:57.206 --> 00:05:58.066 A:middle
is My Marker.

00:05:58.326 --> 00:05:59.856 A:middle
If I select this annotation, the

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:01.676 A:middle
subtitle will appear, but it
