00:52:58.456 --> 00:53:00.026 A:middle
handler is working, so, my

00:53:00.026 --> 00:53:02.076 A:middle
previous highlighting has

00:53:02.076 --> 00:53:04.536 A:middle
disappeared, and now, the new

00:53:04.606 --> 00:53:06.536 A:middle
selection is shown correctly.

00:53:07.026 --> 00:53:08.346 A:middle
So, this seems to be working

00:53:08.346 --> 00:53:08.866 A:middle
pretty well.

00:53:09.546 --> 00:53:11.516 A:middle
Here is another example.

00:53:12.876 --> 00:53:14.766 A:middle
So again, I can select these

00:53:14.766 --> 00:53:15.236 A:middle
routes.

00:53:15.666 --> 00:53:18.266 A:middle
But now I want to know more

00:53:18.266 --> 00:53:18.706 A:middle
about them.

00:53:18.706 --> 00:53:19.666 A:middle
I want to know what are the

00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:21.076 A:middle
driving directions, how long it

00:53:21.076 --> 00:53:23.246 A:middle
takes to use one of the routes

00:53:23.246 --> 00:53:27.296 A:middle
versus another, etc. So, this is

00:53:27.296 --> 00:53:29.246 A:middle
very simple to do because all of

00:53:29.446 --> 00:53:31.446 A:middle
the - everything that I need is

00:53:31.446 --> 00:53:32.276 A:middle
already in place.

00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:35.646 A:middle
I have saved data on my

00:53:35.646 --> 00:53:38.226 A:middle
overlays, and I have Event List

00:53:38.226 --> 00:53:39.166 A:middle
now for Selection and

00:53:39.166 --> 00:53:39.716 A:middle
Deselection.

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.266 A:middle
So, when the overlay's selected,

00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:46.046 A:middle
I will show the data in the

00:53:46.136 --> 00:53:47.106 A:middle
sidebar.

00:53:48.636 --> 00:53:50.336 A:middle
So, this is just classic.

00:53:50.336 --> 00:53:51.856 A:middle
Now, we are really into web

00:53:51.856 --> 00:53:54.986 A:middle
development land where we have a

00:53:54.986 --> 00:53:56.516 A:middle
bunch of the time we went to --

00:53:56.696 --> 00:53:58.396 A:middle
format it into some HTML, so I

00:53:58.396 --> 00:53:59.356 A:middle
won't go over the details.

00:53:59.876 --> 00:54:01.806 A:middle
But the detail that we have is
