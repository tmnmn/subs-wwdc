00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.076 A:middle
set this tint color to a red

00:14:00.076 --> 00:14:00.406 A:middle
color.

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.236 A:middle
You can use any CSS color value

00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:02.486 A:middle
here.

00:14:03.796 --> 00:14:06.896 A:middle
The MapKit will use your

00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:07.686 A:middle
[inaudible] language

00:14:07.686 --> 00:14:11.206 A:middle
configuration, so that it will

00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:13.806 A:middle
adapt itself to the language

00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:14.886 A:middle
that your user expects.

00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:16.426 A:middle
You can also set that language

00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:18.266 A:middle
into the initialization code or

00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:19.596 A:middle
you can even set it on the fly

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:20.836 A:middle
using the language property.

00:14:21.216 --> 00:14:22.746 A:middle
So here, I've set it to Japanese

00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:24.216 A:middle
so that I'm sure -- so that I

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:26.836 A:middle
can show the map, as well as the

00:14:26.836 --> 00:14:27.846 A:middle
controls in Japanese.

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:29.826 A:middle
So, you can see the North

00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:31.076 A:middle
indicator for instance in the

00:14:31.076 --> 00:14:32.816 A:middle
Compass has been replaced, and

00:14:32.816 --> 00:14:34.846 A:middle
the units are not in -- using

00:14:34.846 --> 00:14:36.526 A:middle
the metric system which is more

00:14:36.526 --> 00:14:38.406 A:middle
traditional in Japan, than using

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:40.176 A:middle
miles or years.

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:44.476 A:middle
If you set your language to a

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:46.216 A:middle
right to left language, such as

00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:47.376 A:middle
Hebrew in this example, or

00:14:47.376 --> 00:14:49.076 A:middle
Arabic, the controls are also

00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
mirrored to match your users'

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:52.066 A:middle
expectations.

00:14:52.656 --> 00:14:55.376 A:middle
So, the controls are the way --

00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:57.196 A:middle
are some of the ways that your

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.946 A:middle
users can interact with the map,

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:00.046 A:middle
but again, also in turn
