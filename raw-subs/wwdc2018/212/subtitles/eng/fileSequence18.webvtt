00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:01.496 A:middle
longitude delta there.

00:18:01.736 --> 00:18:03.236 A:middle
How did I come up with the

00:18:03.236 --> 00:18:04.776 A:middle
region or with the coordinates

00:18:04.776 --> 00:18:05.886 A:middle
that I showed you in these

00:18:05.886 --> 00:18:06.416 A:middle
screen shots?

00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:09.046 A:middle
There are many ways to decide on

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:12.196 A:middle
regions and coordinates.

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:14.006 A:middle
You can look them up on

00:18:14.006 --> 00:18:15.556 A:middle
Wikipedia and help put them in

00:18:15.556 --> 00:18:16.096 A:middle
your code.

00:18:16.276 --> 00:18:17.746 A:middle
You could get them from some

00:18:17.746 --> 00:18:20.276 A:middle
database that has some

00:18:20.276 --> 00:18:21.486 A:middle
geographical information.

00:18:21.986 --> 00:18:23.706 A:middle
But one way that you can also

00:18:23.706 --> 00:18:26.226 A:middle
get this information, is to use

00:18:26.226 --> 00:18:29.366 A:middle
MapKit Services that includes

00:18:29.366 --> 00:18:30.866 A:middle
Geocoding and Search.

00:18:31.096 --> 00:18:33.256 A:middle
So, Geocoding lets you look at a

00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:35.796 A:middle
place and will return your

00:18:35.796 --> 00:18:36.966 A:middle
coordinate in a region.

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:38.776 A:middle
So, in these previous examples,

00:18:38.776 --> 00:18:41.116 A:middle
I used the geocoding from MapKit

00:18:41.116 --> 00:18:43.046 A:middle
JS to look at the coordinate in

00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:44.486 A:middle
the region for Rio de Janeiro

00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:45.866 A:middle
and this is what I set on my

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:46.846 A:middle
map.

00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:48.016 A:middle
You can also use search to

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:50.026 A:middle
search for places.

00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:52.876 A:middle
And it will return not only the

00:18:52.876 --> 00:18:54.326 A:middle
coordinates of these places, but

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:55.696 A:middle
also bounding region that you

00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:57.166 A:middle
can set on your map, to make

00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:59.146 A:middle
sure that it encloses all of the
