00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:01.926 A:middle
For the MapKit JS Beta, we're

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:03.646 A:middle
making this amount of free usage

00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:05.626 A:middle
available to you per day.

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:11.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:12.936 A:middle
So, that's a good amount.

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:15.386 A:middle
And -- but if you need more for

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:17.126 A:middle
your particular use case or your

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:18.996 A:middle
business, you can contact us.

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:20.116 A:middle
There's a form online.

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:21.826 A:middle
Just fill it out and submit it,

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.086 A:middle
and we will receive that

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:23.736 A:middle
request.

00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:27.146 A:middle
To use MapKit JS, you need a

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:28.816 A:middle
key, and you can get that by

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:30.086 A:middle
signing into your developer

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:31.736 A:middle
account, and go to the

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.526 A:middle
Certificates, ID's, and Profiles

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:34.016 A:middle
Panel.

00:03:34.216 --> 00:03:35.716 A:middle
And you can get a key there,

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.606 A:middle
just like you would for any

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:39.286 A:middle
other service in your developer

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:39.706 A:middle
account.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.346 A:middle
There's a limited number of keys

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.256 A:middle
available for the MapKit JS

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:46.336 A:middle
Beta, so I suggest you go and

00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:47.796 A:middle
get one as soon as possible.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:52.826 A:middle
Once you get a key and start

00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:54.636 A:middle
using MapKit JS, I mean, I'm

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:56.896 A:middle
biased because I work on it, but

00:03:56.896 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
I think there's a lot of things

00:03:58.096 --> 00:03:59.156 A:middle
that you're going to really like

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.196 A:middle
about it.
