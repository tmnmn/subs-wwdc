00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.196 A:middle
about it.

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:02.596 A:middle
The first thing is, it lets you

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:04.796 A:middle
unify on one map provider, for

00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:06.686 A:middle
both your app and your website.

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:08.206 A:middle
So, we've noticed lots of you

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.806 A:middle
are using Apple Maps inside your

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:10.776 A:middle
apps.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:12.066 A:middle
Now, you'll be able to use Apple

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:12.976 A:middle
Maps everywhere.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:18.196 A:middle
The MapKit JS APIs, are really

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:20.125 A:middle
inspired by the APIs that you're

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.495 A:middle
already using inside native

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:22.936 A:middle
MapKit, but they're using

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:24.316 A:middle
conventions that are familiar to

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:25.106 A:middle
web developers.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:28.046 A:middle
So, they should be easy for you

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:29.776 A:middle
to adapt.

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:32.256 A:middle
Also, MapKit JS really brings

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:36.016 A:middle
the Apple Maps experience to web

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:36.576 A:middle
pages.

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:38.266 A:middle
It's localized and in 32

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:39.886 A:middle
languages with full right to

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:40.786 A:middle
left support.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.776 A:middle
It's accessible via keyboard

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.576 A:middle
access and with voiceover.

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:47.556 A:middle
It has the beautiful cartography

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:48.686 A:middle
that we all know and love in

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:49.446 A:middle
Apple Maps.

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:51.006 A:middle
And it has support for native

00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:52.646 A:middle
gestures like Pinch to Zoom,

00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:55.236 A:middle
Two-Finger Rotation, and also

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:56.886 A:middle
Shift, and Two Finger Scroll to

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:57.476 A:middle
zoom in.

00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.416 A:middle
It also uses something that's
