00:53:59.876 --> 00:54:01.806 A:middle
But the detail that we have is

00:54:01.806 --> 00:54:03.366 A:middle
the one that is associated with

00:54:03.366 --> 00:54:03.876 A:middle
the overlay.

00:54:04.456 --> 00:54:05.836 A:middle
And it gets shown when the

00:54:05.836 --> 00:54:06.736 A:middle
overlay's selected.

00:54:07.596 --> 00:54:08.866 A:middle
And I will not make the same

00:54:08.866 --> 00:54:09.666 A:middle
mistake about this this

00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:11.126 A:middle
selection, so I will directly

00:54:11.556 --> 00:54:13.156 A:middle
hide the data when the overlay's

00:54:13.156 --> 00:54:14.406 A:middle
deselected so that I don't have

00:54:14.406 --> 00:54:16.236 A:middle
several routes appearing at

00:54:16.236 --> 00:54:16.616 A:middle
once.

00:54:18.176 --> 00:54:19.366 A:middle
So, let's try again.

00:54:20.596 --> 00:54:21.536 A:middle
Let's go back.

00:54:21.536 --> 00:54:22.476 A:middle
I like this example.

00:54:23.856 --> 00:54:26.116 A:middle
So again, I will select this

00:54:26.116 --> 00:54:26.426 A:middle
route.

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:27.696 A:middle
And now that the route is

00:54:27.696 --> 00:54:29.666 A:middle
selected, we can see on the

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.586 A:middle
right-hand side that we have

00:54:31.586 --> 00:54:32.906 A:middle
some additional information.

00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:34.656 A:middle
This is a quick name for the

00:54:34.656 --> 00:54:34.906 A:middle
route.

00:54:34.906 --> 00:54:36.026 A:middle
So, this is the route that goes

00:54:36.026 --> 00:54:38.596 A:middle
from Mount Hamilton Road.

00:54:38.596 --> 00:54:40.126 A:middle
It's 70 kilometers long and

00:54:40.126 --> 00:54:41.626 A:middle
under ideal driving conditions,

00:54:41.626 --> 00:54:43.316 A:middle
it should take me an hour and 32

00:54:43.316 --> 00:54:44.706 A:middle
minutes to reach there.

00:54:44.706 --> 00:54:46.446 A:middle
And here are all the steps that

00:54:46.446 --> 00:54:48.276 A:middle
I can follow to get to my

00:54:48.276 --> 00:54:48.966 A:middle
destination.

00:54:49.906 --> 00:54:51.196 A:middle
I could see what this one looks

00:54:51.196 --> 00:54:51.516 A:middle
like.

00:54:52.146 --> 00:54:54.136 A:middle
It's actually longer in distance

00:54:54.136 --> 00:54:56.056 A:middle
but it should get me there

00:54:56.056 --> 00:54:56.496 A:middle
faster.

00:54:57.246 --> 00:54:59.826 A:middle
So, there we are.

00:54:59.826 --> 00:55:02.836 A:middle
We have built a Bigfoot Finder
