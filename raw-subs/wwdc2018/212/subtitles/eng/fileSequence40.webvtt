00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:00.056 A:middle
optionally provide at Gets User

00:40:00.056 --> 00:40:01.086 A:middle
Location parameter.

00:40:01.696 --> 00:40:02.946 A:middle
This will allow you to provide

00:40:02.946 --> 00:40:04.886 A:middle
more context to the geocoder.

00:40:05.376 --> 00:40:06.776 A:middle
This is useful in the case where

00:40:06.776 --> 00:40:08.346 A:middle
there are places with the same

00:40:08.346 --> 00:40:09.876 A:middle
name in multiple locations.

00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:12.206 A:middle
For example, if you're using the

00:40:12.206 --> 00:40:14.236 A:middle
geocoder here, you'll be most

00:40:14.316 --> 00:40:15.916 A:middle
likely to return Brisbane,

00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.446 A:middle
California instead of Brisbane,

00:40:17.446 --> 00:40:17.926 A:middle
Australia.

00:40:19.456 --> 00:40:21.446 A:middle
Next, you build the requests.

00:40:21.756 --> 00:40:22.576 A:middle
Here, we're using this

00:40:22.576 --> 00:40:23.426 A:middle
convention center.

00:40:23.976 --> 00:40:26.236 A:middle
And then you can handle the

00:40:26.236 --> 00:40:26.866 A:middle
response.

00:40:27.596 --> 00:40:28.976 A:middle
As we mentioned before, the

00:40:28.976 --> 00:40:30.816 A:middle
geocoder can easily be used to

00:40:30.816 --> 00:40:32.416 A:middle
place marker annotations.

00:40:32.646 --> 00:40:33.986 A:middle
So, here we're adding a marker

00:40:33.986 --> 00:40:34.826 A:middle
annotation to the map.

00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:39.376 A:middle
And then here we have an example

00:40:39.376 --> 00:40:41.066 A:middle
of the reverse lookup where we

00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:42.446 A:middle
have a coordinate, and we want

00:40:42.446 --> 00:40:43.436 A:middle
to find the address for the

00:40:43.436 --> 00:40:43.856 A:middle
place.

00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:47.226 A:middle
So, that's the geocoder.

00:40:47.856 --> 00:40:50.856 A:middle
Next up we have service context.

00:40:51.256 --> 00:40:52.426 A:middle
So, as I mentioned before, you

00:40:52.426 --> 00:40:54.326 A:middle
can provide a Gets User Location

00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:55.816 A:middle
parameter, but you can also

00:40:55.816 --> 00:40:57.716 A:middle
provide coordinate and region to

00:40:57.716 --> 00:40:58.186 A:middle
search.

00:40:58.876 --> 00:41:00.196 A:middle
This is useful to provide the
