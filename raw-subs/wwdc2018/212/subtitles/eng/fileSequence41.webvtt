00:40:58.876 --> 00:41:00.196 A:middle
This is useful to provide the

00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:01.606 A:middle
most relevant results to your

00:41:01.606 --> 00:41:02.086 A:middle
user.

00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:06.036 A:middle
So, that's where places are in

00:41:06.036 --> 00:41:07.436 A:middle
multiple locations with the same

00:41:07.436 --> 00:41:08.966 A:middle
name, or you can provide your

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:10.156 A:middle
search results, closer to the

00:41:10.156 --> 00:41:10.486 A:middle
user.

00:41:12.576 --> 00:41:14.616 A:middle
Here's an example of how you can

00:41:14.616 --> 00:41:15.776 A:middle
use the Search Service.

00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:18.066 A:middle
It's an example for finding

00:41:18.066 --> 00:41:19.316 A:middle
coffee nearby the user.

00:41:20.536 --> 00:41:22.026 A:middle
So first, you create your

00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:22.846 A:middle
service object.

00:41:24.446 --> 00:41:26.226 A:middle
Then you build your request

00:41:26.346 --> 00:41:28.916 A:middle
using query like coffee.

00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:30.126 A:middle
You can also do something more

00:41:30.126 --> 00:41:31.926 A:middle
specific like a specific name of

00:41:31.926 --> 00:41:33.256 A:middle
a coffee shop that you have.

00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:36.856 A:middle
And then you can handle the

00:41:36.856 --> 00:41:39.856 A:middle
results, which can easily be

00:41:39.856 --> 00:41:41.776 A:middle
displayed using annotation since

00:41:41.776 --> 00:41:43.396 A:middle
sometimes you return multiple

00:41:43.696 --> 00:41:44.286 A:middle
results.

00:41:44.286 --> 00:41:45.646 A:middle
And you can use the coordinate

00:41:45.646 --> 00:41:47.896 A:middle
as well as the title to populate

00:41:47.926 --> 00:41:49.196 A:middle
the fields of annotation.

00:41:49.736 --> 00:41:51.936 A:middle
And then finally, we

00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:53.596 A:middle
simultaneously add and display

00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:55.006 A:middle
the annotations using the Map

00:41:55.006 --> 00:41:56.066 A:middle
Show Items method.

00:41:57.776 --> 00:41:59.716 A:middle
So, this is useful if you have

00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
your full query that you want to
