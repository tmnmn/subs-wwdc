00:16:59.376 --> 00:17:01.286 A:middle
So, a coordinate region is made

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.756 A:middle
up of a center, which is

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:04.465 A:middle
represented by these dots at the

00:17:04.465 --> 00:17:06.506 A:middle
center of the map, as well as a

00:17:06.506 --> 00:17:07.876 A:middle
latitude and longitude span.

00:17:07.876 --> 00:17:09.226 A:middle
So here, I have represented the

00:17:09.226 --> 00:17:12.076 A:middle
region as this dotted box.

00:17:12.986 --> 00:17:14.896 A:middle
But we will not that the map --

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:16.076 A:middle
the region that is set

00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:18.246 A:middle
ultimately on your map, will be

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.626 A:middle
bigger than the region that you

00:17:19.626 --> 00:17:21.006 A:middle
asked for because we need to

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:22.846 A:middle
make sure that it fits entirely

00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:25.006 A:middle
within the bounds that you have

00:17:25.006 --> 00:17:25.786 A:middle
set for your map.

00:17:26.076 --> 00:17:27.496 A:middle
So, in this case, I need to add

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:29.926 A:middle
some padding, north and south of

00:17:29.926 --> 00:17:31.666 A:middle
the region to be able to show

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:33.456 A:middle
the -- all of the region that

00:17:33.456 --> 00:17:34.496 A:middle
was specified.

00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:37.606 A:middle
So, in terms of putting the

00:17:37.796 --> 00:17:39.856 A:middle
MapKit JS framework -- the

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:42.346 A:middle
center is set to a MapKit

00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:43.746 A:middle
coordinator object which is a

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:45.126 A:middle
latitude and longitude pair.

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:47.966 A:middle
In the Coordinate Region, to set

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:50.156 A:middle
the region of the map, is an

00:17:50.156 --> 00:17:52.006 A:middle
object that contains two member,

00:17:52.126 --> 00:17:53.376 A:middle
a center which is also a

00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:55.486 A:middle
coordinate and a coordinate span

00:17:55.486 --> 00:17:57.076 A:middle
which is a latitude delta and a

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:01.496 A:middle
longitude delta there.
