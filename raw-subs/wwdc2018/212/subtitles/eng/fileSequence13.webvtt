00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:00.166 A:middle
corner.

00:13:00.556 --> 00:13:01.896 A:middle
Of course, we can also select

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:03.096 A:middle
these controls to be always

00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:04.496 A:middle
visible or always hidden.

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:07.466 A:middle
The rest of the controls have a

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:09.326 A:middle
binary state, so they can be

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:11.936 A:middle
hidden or set to be visible by

00:13:11.936 --> 00:13:14.146 A:middle
setting a Boolean property.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:18.286 A:middle
In this example, we show the

00:13:18.286 --> 00:13:19.496 A:middle
controls that do not show by

00:13:19.496 --> 00:13:21.556 A:middle
default on desktop, such as the

00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:23.056 A:middle
User Location Control which

00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:25.206 A:middle
appears in the bottom right of

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:26.086 A:middle
the window.

00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:28.036 A:middle
Here, I've selected it.

00:13:28.036 --> 00:13:29.756 A:middle
So now, the user location is

00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:30.736 A:middle
tracked, and you can see the

00:13:30.736 --> 00:13:32.126 A:middle
user location in the center of

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:32.386 A:middle
the map.

00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:34.586 A:middle
And the Scale is shown at the

00:13:34.586 --> 00:13:36.466 A:middle
top let, because I marked it to

00:13:36.466 --> 00:13:37.376 A:middle
Always Visible.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:40.246 A:middle
We can go further in configuring

00:13:40.246 --> 00:13:40.936 A:middle
these controls.

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.186 A:middle
In order to match better the

00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:45.666 A:middle
color scheme of your page, you

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:47.566 A:middle
can set the tint of the map.

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:49.536 A:middle
And this changes the color of

00:13:49.536 --> 00:13:51.456 A:middle
the user controls.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.606 A:middle
So, you can see, for instance,

00:13:53.606 --> 00:13:54.836 A:middle
the -- all of the controls of

00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:55.086 A:middle
the map.

00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:56.786 A:middle
You can see the user control is

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:58.116 A:middle
now highlighted in red because I

00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.076 A:middle
set this tint color to a red
