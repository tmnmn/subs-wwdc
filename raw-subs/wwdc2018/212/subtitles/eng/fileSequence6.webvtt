00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:01.676 A:middle
subtitle will appear, but it

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
would overlap that label that is

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:04.166 A:middle
beneath it.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.636 A:middle
So, with Client-Side Rendering,

00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:08.086 A:middle
and full control over the

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:09.996 A:middle
labels, we can just collide that

00:06:09.996 --> 00:06:11.976 A:middle
label out and remove it so that

00:06:11.976 --> 00:06:14.056 A:middle
the labels on the map never

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:15.736 A:middle
overlap the text for your

00:06:15.736 --> 00:06:16.546 A:middle
annotations.

00:06:17.516 --> 00:06:20.276 A:middle
And even as users are zooming in

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:22.106 A:middle
and out, and the map labels are

00:06:22.106 --> 00:06:24.016 A:middle
changing all over the place, the

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.666 A:middle
map labels are never going to

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:27.406 A:middle
overlap your annotation labels.

00:06:28.156 --> 00:06:29.936 A:middle
In fact, if you have a draggable

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:31.286 A:middle
annotation and the user is

00:06:31.286 --> 00:06:33.036 A:middle
picking it up and moving it all

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.716 A:middle
over the map, labels are never

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:37.726 A:middle
going to overlap your annotation

00:06:37.726 --> 00:06:38.216 A:middle
labels.

00:06:38.896 --> 00:06:41.166 A:middle
So, this is one of the rendering

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.596 A:middle
modes, Client-Side Rendering.

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:45.026 A:middle
But web code can run anywhere,

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:47.066 A:middle
and not all devices are created

00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:47.546 A:middle
equal.

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:51.616 A:middle
So, for those times when your

00:06:51.616 --> 00:06:53.046 A:middle
users may be running on a low

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:54.646 A:middle
performance configuration, maybe

00:06:54.646 --> 00:06:56.856 A:middle
an old device, we have a

00:06:56.856 --> 00:06:58.076 A:middle
different mode that we call

00:06:58.076 --> 00:06:59.276 A:middle
Labels Only Client-Side

00:06:59.276 --> 00:06:59.766 A:middle
Rendering.
