00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:00.316 A:middle
is much cleaner because all of

00:30:00.316 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
the collisions have been a

00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:02.876 A:middle
result.

00:30:02.876 --> 00:30:04.376 A:middle
You can see that some of the

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:05.296 A:middle
annotations are brown.

00:30:05.296 --> 00:30:06.046 A:middle
So, these are the clear

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:06.526 A:middle
sightings.

00:30:06.526 --> 00:30:07.976 A:middle
These are probably the ones that

00:30:07.976 --> 00:30:10.246 A:middle
are the most interesting ones to

00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:11.376 A:middle
visit first.

00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:13.476 A:middle
But you can also see that if I

00:30:13.476 --> 00:30:15.536 A:middle
zoom in on the map, then new

00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:17.426 A:middle
sightings are being revealed.

00:30:17.736 --> 00:30:19.476 A:middle
So, your users can explore the

00:30:19.476 --> 00:30:21.716 A:middle
map and find out about where

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:24.356 A:middle
they can hope to see Bigfoot.

00:30:24.476 --> 00:30:27.436 A:middle
I will conclude by this demo, by

00:30:27.436 --> 00:30:29.776 A:middle
adding, another piece of

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.026 A:middle
information to my map.

00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:33.776 A:middle
I will change the glyph to be

00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:37.436 A:middle
either an icon of Bigfoot which

00:30:37.436 --> 00:30:37.956 A:middle
I've prepared.

00:30:37.956 --> 00:30:40.986 A:middle
So, this is a simple PNG image

00:30:41.946 --> 00:30:43.286 A:middle
which I will use for the clear

00:30:43.286 --> 00:30:45.916 A:middle
sightings, and in case the

00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:47.406 A:middle
sighting is not so clear, I will

00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:49.876 A:middle
make that more explicit by

00:30:49.876 --> 00:30:52.676 A:middle
setting the glyph text to be a

00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:53.356 A:middle
question mark.

00:30:54.876 --> 00:30:57.906 A:middle
And now, what I can see, is that

00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:00.966 A:middle
these questionable sightings are
