00:25:59.826 --> 00:26:01.466 A:middle
to show these annotations in

00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:01.826 A:middle
action.

00:26:06.276 --> 00:26:08.856 A:middle
So, in this demo, which should

00:26:10.456 --> 00:26:12.886 A:middle
appear here -- in this demo, we

00:26:12.886 --> 00:26:15.656 A:middle
will use a map and the data that

00:26:15.656 --> 00:26:18.306 A:middle
we will display is Bigfoot

00:26:18.306 --> 00:26:19.866 A:middle
Sightings that Have Occurred in

00:26:19.866 --> 00:26:20.386 A:middle
this Area.

00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:23.166 A:middle
So, after this session, or maybe

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.146 A:middle
this weekend when you are done

00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:26.926 A:middle
with the conference, you can

00:26:26.926 --> 00:26:29.066 A:middle
maybe go explore the woods of

00:26:29.066 --> 00:26:30.396 A:middle
Northern California and see if

00:26:30.396 --> 00:26:33.776 A:middle
you can find Bigfoot.

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:37.086 A:middle
I have created a map which I

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:38.446 A:middle
have initialized in the manner

00:26:38.446 --> 00:26:40.966 A:middle
that I've displayed in the

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:41.786 A:middle
previous slides.

00:26:42.746 --> 00:26:46.086 A:middle
And what I have done, is I have

00:26:46.086 --> 00:26:47.646 A:middle
gathered a list of Bigfoot

00:26:47.646 --> 00:26:49.246 A:middle
annotations -- of Bigfoot

00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:51.716 A:middle
sightings, sorry, including the

00:26:51.716 --> 00:26:53.466 A:middle
location, the year in which they

00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:56.206 A:middle
occurred, and some other

00:26:56.206 --> 00:26:56.896 A:middle
information.

00:26:57.446 --> 00:26:58.696 A:middle
So, what I will want to do is I

00:26:58.696 --> 00:26:59.476 A:middle
will want to use these

00:26:59.476 --> 00:27:00.716 A:middle
annotations, show them on the
