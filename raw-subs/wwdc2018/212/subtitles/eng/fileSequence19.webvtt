00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:01.156 A:middle
results.

00:19:01.246 --> 00:19:02.956 A:middle
Another way to quickly set a

00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:04.566 A:middle
region on your map that is very

00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:05.976 A:middle
convenient, is a method called

00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:06.736 A:middle
Show Items.

00:19:07.106 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
We will see now how to add

00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:10.266 A:middle
annotations and overlays on your

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:11.916 A:middle
map, and by calling Show Items,

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:13.706 A:middle
we will make sure that we have a

00:19:13.706 --> 00:19:15.646 A:middle
region that encloses these items

00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:17.076 A:middle
so that they are all visible to

00:19:17.076 --> 00:19:17.536 A:middle
your user.

00:19:18.796 --> 00:19:21.066 A:middle
I will note that region changes

00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:23.226 A:middle
may be animated, so that you can

00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:24.646 A:middle
provide a nice animation.

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.236 A:middle
Or you can set the region

00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:26.776 A:middle
instantly.

00:19:28.256 --> 00:19:31.666 A:middle
Because these things, changing

00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:33.676 A:middle
the regions, changing the

00:19:33.676 --> 00:19:35.296 A:middle
center, etcetera, can be done

00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:37.206 A:middle
from your code but can also be

00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:38.776 A:middle
done by the user as a result of

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:40.686 A:middle
interactions you want to be able

00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:42.636 A:middle
to react to these interactions.

00:19:43.086 --> 00:19:44.586 A:middle
And we -- and the Map Object

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:48.496 A:middle
allows you to listen to user

00:19:48.496 --> 00:19:50.616 A:middle
events such as region changes,

00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:51.856 A:middle
when they begin, when they end,

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:53.886 A:middle
since they can be animated.

00:19:54.186 --> 00:19:55.926 A:middle
And also, when gestures such as

00:19:55.926 --> 00:19:57.676 A:middle
coding, zooming, rotations begin

00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:58.116 A:middle
and end.

00:19:58.526 --> 00:20:00.986 A:middle
We follow the model of DOM Event
