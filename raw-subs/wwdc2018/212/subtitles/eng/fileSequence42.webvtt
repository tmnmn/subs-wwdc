00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:01.306 A:middle
your full query that you want to

00:42:01.476 --> 00:42:03.066 A:middle
send in the request, but if you

00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:04.326 A:middle
have a Search Bar that you want

00:42:04.326 --> 00:42:06.356 A:middle
to respond to user input, you

00:42:06.356 --> 00:42:07.846 A:middle
can use the Search Autocomplete

00:42:07.966 --> 00:42:08.246 A:middle
Method.

00:42:09.636 --> 00:42:10.936 A:middle
With Search Autocomplete, you

00:42:10.936 --> 00:42:12.506 A:middle
can provide a partial query to

00:42:12.506 --> 00:42:15.476 A:middle
the user - to the service, and

00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:16.496 A:middle
then save your user some

00:42:16.496 --> 00:42:17.756 A:middle
keystrokes by providing

00:42:17.756 --> 00:42:19.326 A:middle
suggestions which you can then

00:42:19.326 --> 00:42:20.606 A:middle
use to complete a search.

00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:25.036 A:middle
And the last service is

00:42:26.616 --> 00:42:27.216 A:middle
directions.

00:42:27.376 --> 00:42:28.616 A:middle
Similarly, to the other

00:42:28.616 --> 00:42:29.846 A:middle
services, you create your

00:42:29.936 --> 00:42:30.776 A:middle
directions object.

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.356 A:middle
You can choose to provide a

00:42:33.356 --> 00:42:34.816 A:middle
language which will then return

00:42:34.816 --> 00:42:36.826 A:middle
the route steps in that provided

00:42:36.826 --> 00:42:37.356 A:middle
language.

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.446 A:middle
If you don't provide a language,

00:42:40.706 --> 00:42:41.766 A:middle
the language provided to the

00:42:41.766 --> 00:42:43.356 A:middle
MapKit initialization function

00:42:43.356 --> 00:42:43.996 A:middle
will be used.

00:42:44.286 --> 00:42:46.086 A:middle
And if that's not provided, the

00:42:46.086 --> 00:42:47.276 A:middle
browser's preferred language

00:42:47.276 --> 00:42:47.776 A:middle
will be used.

00:42:49.456 --> 00:42:51.256 A:middle
Then you build your request

00:42:51.256 --> 00:42:53.126 A:middle
using two required fields: the

00:42:53.126 --> 00:42:54.666 A:middle
origin and the destination.

00:42:55.056 --> 00:42:56.636 A:middle
These can be coordinates,

00:42:56.636 --> 00:42:58.016 A:middle
addresses, or places.

00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:01.646 A:middle
By default, the transportation
