00:36:57.746 --> 00:37:00.096 A:middle
show the population of every

00:37:00.096 --> 00:37:01.606 A:middle
state of the United States.

00:37:01.726 --> 00:37:04.266 A:middle
I can show it as a color, which

00:37:04.266 --> 00:37:05.656 A:middle
gives me a rough idea of the

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:06.356 A:middle
population.

00:37:06.706 --> 00:37:08.356 A:middle
But I can also add some

00:37:08.356 --> 00:37:09.816 A:middle
additional data so that if the

00:37:09.816 --> 00:37:11.766 A:middle
user selects one of the

00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:13.646 A:middle
overlays, so in this case, the

00:37:13.646 --> 00:37:15.926 A:middle
State of Texas, I can show that

00:37:15.926 --> 00:37:18.246 A:middle
the actual population is over 20

00:37:18.246 --> 00:37:18.866 A:middle
million people.

00:37:19.896 --> 00:37:21.736 A:middle
And overlays are selectable just

00:37:21.736 --> 00:37:22.596 A:middle
like annotations.

00:37:25.156 --> 00:37:27.976 A:middle
To show overlays such as the

00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:29.776 A:middle
route that I showed you or to

00:37:29.776 --> 00:37:31.966 A:middle
show all of the states, we need

00:37:31.966 --> 00:37:33.326 A:middle
a lot of data, we need a lot of

00:37:33.326 --> 00:37:34.866 A:middle
points, so for the states, we

00:37:34.866 --> 00:37:36.516 A:middle
had thousands and thousands of

00:37:36.516 --> 00:37:36.886 A:middle
points.

00:37:37.866 --> 00:37:39.496 A:middle
So, a convenient way to get that

00:37:39.496 --> 00:37:41.396 A:middle
data into your program, is to

00:37:41.396 --> 00:37:42.356 A:middle
use GeoJSON Import.

00:37:42.356 --> 00:37:43.826 A:middle
So, if you have a GeoJSON data

00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:45.296 A:middle
file, then you can import it

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:47.336 A:middle
automatically using MapKit JS.

00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:49.036 A:middle
Annotations and overlays are

00:37:49.036 --> 00:37:49.536 A:middle
created.

00:37:49.536 --> 00:37:51.376 A:middle
So, in this example, this was a

00:37:51.376 --> 00:37:53.056 A:middle
different data file, which

00:37:53.056 --> 00:37:55.246 A:middle
contained a lot of UFO

00:37:55.246 --> 00:37:55.836 A:middle
sightings.

00:37:56.196 --> 00:37:58.286 A:middle
And this is just a detail of the

00:37:58.286 --> 00:37:58.476 A:middle
map.

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.796 A:middle
So, you can see there are lots

00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:01.566 A:middle
of these sightings.
