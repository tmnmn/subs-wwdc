00:07:57.756 --> 00:08:00.956 A:middle
In our experience so far, most

00:08:00.956 --> 00:08:02.406 A:middle
users are getting Client-Side

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:03.706 A:middle
Rendering or Labels Only

00:08:03.706 --> 00:08:04.726 A:middle
Client-Side Rendering.

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:07.686 A:middle
So, that's a quick introduction

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:08.696 A:middle
to MapKit JS.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.706 A:middle
And now, to tell you more about

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:12.176 A:middle
using the API, I'm going to hand

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:13.706 A:middle
it off to Julien Quint.

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:18.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Vicki.

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:26.106 A:middle
Let's get down to the technical

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.896 A:middle
details of using MapKit JS for

00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:28.456 A:middle
your website.

00:08:29.256 --> 00:08:31.386 A:middle
We will see how to set up a map.

00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:33.726 A:middle
We will see how to navigate an

00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:34.916 A:middle
annotate this map so that you

00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:36.155 A:middle
can show your own data.

00:08:37.556 --> 00:08:38.626 A:middle
And finally, we'll see how to

00:08:38.626 --> 00:08:40.816 A:middle
enable rich interactions with

00:08:40.816 --> 00:08:41.806 A:middle
additional services.

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:45.686 A:middle
To set up your map, you need to

00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:46.846 A:middle
go through these four steps.

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:49.466 A:middle
First step is to import MapKit

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:50.326 A:middle
JS.

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:51.726 A:middle
Here you see a script tag that

00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:53.026 A:middle
you can add somewhere on your

00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:53.436 A:middle
page.

00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:57.356 A:middle
And the URL of the MapKit JS

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:59.736 A:middle
script includes a version

00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:00.046 A:middle
number.
