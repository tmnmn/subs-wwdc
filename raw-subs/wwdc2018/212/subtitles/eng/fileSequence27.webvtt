00:26:59.476 --> 00:27:00.716 A:middle
annotations, show them on the

00:27:00.716 --> 00:27:02.416 A:middle
map, with marker annotation.

00:27:02.416 --> 00:27:04.296 A:middle
So, let me start by creating a

00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:06.896 A:middle
function to translate a sighting

00:27:06.896 --> 00:27:08.136 A:middle
object which has all these

00:27:08.136 --> 00:27:09.986 A:middle
properties, into a marker

00:27:09.986 --> 00:27:10.616 A:middle
annotation.

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.486 A:middle
So, when I get a sighting, I

00:27:13.486 --> 00:27:14.966 A:middle
want the coordinate of the

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.126 A:middle
sighting to be used as the

00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:17.186 A:middle
coordinate of my marker

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:17.776 A:middle
annotation.

00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:20.156 A:middle
And these sightings have several

00:27:20.156 --> 00:27:21.286 A:middle
other properties, such as the

00:27:21.286 --> 00:27:22.376 A:middle
year of the sighting, which I

00:27:22.376 --> 00:27:24.336 A:middle
will display in the title.

00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:26.806 A:middle
This comes from a database put

00:27:26.806 --> 00:27:28.446 A:middle
together by the Bigfoot Field

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:30.426 A:middle
Researchers Organization.

00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:32.706 A:middle
So, I will show the idea so that

00:27:32.706 --> 00:27:33.936 A:middle
if you are interested in more

00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:35.106 A:middle
details about that sighting, you

00:27:35.106 --> 00:27:37.596 A:middle
can go look at that database and

00:27:37.596 --> 00:27:39.486 A:middle
find even more information.

00:27:39.956 --> 00:27:41.986 A:middle
And finally, I'm ready to create

00:27:41.986 --> 00:27:43.216 A:middle
a marker annotation with that

00:27:43.216 --> 00:27:44.706 A:middle
coordinate and these options

00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:45.406 A:middle
that I've created.

00:27:46.306 --> 00:27:47.766 A:middle
So, now that I know how to set

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.646 A:middle
up a marker annotation for a

00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:52.616 A:middle
sighting, I will get the

00:27:52.616 --> 00:27:54.756 A:middle
sightings that I've prepared.

00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:58.426 A:middle
And with this list of sightings,

00:27:58.816 --> 00:28:00.566 A:middle
I will create an annotation for
