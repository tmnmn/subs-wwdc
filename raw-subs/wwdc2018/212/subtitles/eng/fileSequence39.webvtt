00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:07.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; MapKit JS provides you with

00:39:07.216 --> 00:39:08.776 A:middle
access to three services,

00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:10.816 A:middle
Geocoding, Search, and

00:39:10.886 --> 00:39:11.536 A:middle
Directions.

00:39:12.346 --> 00:39:14.126 A:middle
I'll step through examples of

00:39:14.126 --> 00:39:15.476 A:middle
each of those, but before that,

00:39:15.476 --> 00:39:16.386 A:middle
I'll tell you what they have in

00:39:16.386 --> 00:39:16.756 A:middle
common.

00:39:17.296 --> 00:39:19.876 A:middle
You can use the services in a

00:39:19.876 --> 00:39:21.546 A:middle
similar way, with four easy

00:39:21.546 --> 00:39:21.916 A:middle
steps.

00:39:22.536 --> 00:39:23.806 A:middle
You first create the service

00:39:23.806 --> 00:39:25.996 A:middle
object, then you specify the

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.666 A:middle
request parameters and options,

00:39:28.376 --> 00:39:30.366 A:middle
then you make the request, and

00:39:30.366 --> 00:39:31.926 A:middle
finally, handle the asynchronous

00:39:31.926 --> 00:39:33.286 A:middle
response via a callback

00:39:33.286 --> 00:39:33.676 A:middle
function.

00:39:34.186 --> 00:39:35.766 A:middle
So first, let's talk about the

00:39:35.766 --> 00:39:36.326 A:middle
Geocoder.

00:39:37.916 --> 00:39:39.816 A:middle
Here's an example of how you can

00:39:39.816 --> 00:39:41.756 A:middle
use the Geocoder, and it has two

00:39:41.896 --> 00:39:43.716 A:middle
methods: Lookup and Reverse

00:39:43.716 --> 00:39:44.126 A:middle
Lookup.

00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:45.986 A:middle
So, this is if have you an

00:39:46.066 --> 00:39:47.636 A:middle
address or a place, and you want

00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:49.236 A:middle
to find the coordinate, or if

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:50.026 A:middle
you have the opposite.

00:39:50.026 --> 00:39:51.046 A:middle
You have a coordinate and you

00:39:51.046 --> 00:39:53.826 A:middle
want to find the address.

00:39:54.046 --> 00:39:55.386 A:middle
So, the first step is to create

00:39:55.386 --> 00:39:58.106 A:middle
your object, which you can

00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:00.056 A:middle
optionally provide at Gets User
