00:20:58.566 --> 00:21:00.166 A:middle
completely customizable

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:01.196 A:middle
appearance.

00:21:02.336 --> 00:21:04.096 A:middle
The marker annotations are the

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.136 A:middle
most useful annotations that

00:21:06.136 --> 00:21:08.786 A:middle
MapKit JS provide as they also

00:21:08.786 --> 00:21:11.316 A:middle
have lots of rich interaction

00:21:11.316 --> 00:21:11.806 A:middle
built-in.

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:13.766 A:middle
And there's lots of styling

00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:14.136 A:middle
options.

00:21:14.136 --> 00:21:15.416 A:middle
So, they are analogous to the

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:16.616 A:middle
marker annotations that that you

00:21:16.616 --> 00:21:18.106 A:middle
may have seen already on iOS.

00:21:18.716 --> 00:21:20.386 A:middle
They have a built-in animation

00:21:20.386 --> 00:21:22.116 A:middle
for selection and deselection.

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:23.796 A:middle
And they automatically collide

00:21:23.796 --> 00:21:26.116 A:middle
out the underlying map labels as

00:21:26.116 --> 00:21:26.826 A:middle
we've seen before.

00:21:26.826 --> 00:21:27.986 A:middle
So here, when I select my

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.436 A:middle
annotation, the label for the

00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:32.836 A:middle
exit of the station is hidden to

00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:34.186 A:middle
make room for the subtitle.

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:38.376 A:middle
Marker annotations -- the

00:21:39.016 --> 00:21:40.946 A:middle
appearance of marker annotation

00:21:40.946 --> 00:21:43.156 A:middle
also adapts itself automatically

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:44.686 A:middle
to the rendering mode that has

00:21:44.686 --> 00:21:46.176 A:middle
been selected by MapKit JS for

00:21:46.176 --> 00:21:46.466 A:middle
your map.

00:21:46.966 --> 00:21:48.236 A:middle
So, we've seen that if we have

00:21:48.236 --> 00:21:49.666 A:middle
Client-Side Rendering Mode or

00:21:49.666 --> 00:21:51.616 A:middle
Label Only Client-Side Rendering

00:21:51.616 --> 00:21:53.186 A:middle
Mode, we are able to hide

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.926 A:middle
labels, so we can display the

00:21:54.926 --> 00:21:56.296 A:middle
title and the subtitle of your

00:21:56.296 --> 00:21:57.226 A:middle
annotations on the map.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.166 A:middle
And this is what is shown on the

00:21:59.166 --> 00:21:59.816 A:middle
left-hand side.
