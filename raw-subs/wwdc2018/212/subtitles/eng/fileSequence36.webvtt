00:35:58.776 --> 00:36:01.006 A:middle
I receive as a result, a route

00:36:01.006 --> 00:36:02.286 A:middle
which I represent on this map

00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:03.436 A:middle
using a polyline overlay.

00:36:03.746 --> 00:36:05.356 A:middle
And a polyline overlay is a list

00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:05.776 A:middle
of points.

00:36:05.776 --> 00:36:07.556 A:middle
So, these are all coordinates

00:36:07.936 --> 00:36:09.046 A:middle
linked to each other.

00:36:09.046 --> 00:36:11.716 A:middle
I can style them by setting the

00:36:11.716 --> 00:36:13.506 A:middle
Stroke Opacity for instance, or

00:36:13.506 --> 00:36:14.816 A:middle
a thick line width to make sure

00:36:14.816 --> 00:36:16.516 A:middle
that it shows up on my map.

00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:19.506 A:middle
And the last example is a

00:36:19.506 --> 00:36:20.366 A:middle
polygon overlay.

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:21.826 A:middle
This is very useful to do for

00:36:21.826 --> 00:36:23.456 A:middle
instance data visualization.

00:36:23.456 --> 00:36:24.546 A:middle
And here I have a map of the

00:36:24.546 --> 00:36:26.726 A:middle
United States where every state

00:36:26.996 --> 00:36:28.216 A:middle
is an overlay of its own.

00:36:28.216 --> 00:36:30.346 A:middle
A polygon overlay is defined

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:32.436 A:middle
again by a list of points, but

00:36:32.436 --> 00:36:35.406 A:middle
this -- in this case, the shape

00:36:35.406 --> 00:36:36.436 A:middle
is closed and filled.

00:36:37.536 --> 00:36:40.056 A:middle
You can even specify lists of

00:36:40.056 --> 00:36:41.666 A:middle
lists of points to -- for more

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:42.486 A:middle
complex scenarios.

00:36:42.486 --> 00:36:43.416 A:middle
So, for instance, if you have

00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:45.216 A:middle
enclaves and exclaves, which is

00:36:45.216 --> 00:36:46.746 A:middle
often the case with real

00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:47.876 A:middle
geographical areas.

00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:50.776 A:middle
Annotations and overlays can

00:36:50.776 --> 00:36:53.366 A:middle
also have an extra piece of

00:36:53.366 --> 00:36:54.676 A:middle
information added to them, which

00:36:54.676 --> 00:36:56.046 A:middle
is this data property.

00:36:56.496 --> 00:36:57.746 A:middle
So, in this example, I want to

00:36:57.746 --> 00:37:00.096 A:middle
show the population of every
