00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:01.416 A:middle
priority, what I will use is I

00:29:01.416 --> 00:29:04.016 A:middle
will use a very important

00:29:04.016 --> 00:29:06.306 A:middle
property of the sightings which

00:29:06.306 --> 00:29:07.306 A:middle
is whether they were clear

00:29:07.306 --> 00:29:07.786 A:middle
sightings.

00:29:07.786 --> 00:29:09.106 A:middle
So, if someone really, really

00:29:09.106 --> 00:29:11.056 A:middle
saw bigfoot, or maybe they just

00:29:11.056 --> 00:29:13.536 A:middle
heard it or saw some traces of

00:29:13.536 --> 00:29:13.756 A:middle
it.

00:29:14.126 --> 00:29:15.806 A:middle
So, I have this clear flag which

00:29:15.806 --> 00:29:17.296 A:middle
I will use to set my display

00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:17.826 A:middle
priority.

00:29:18.346 --> 00:29:20.116 A:middle
Display priorities a number and

00:29:20.116 --> 00:29:21.346 A:middle
these priorities can be pretty

00:29:21.346 --> 00:29:22.016 A:middle
arbitrary.

00:29:22.306 --> 00:29:24.416 A:middle
So, we provide predefined

00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:26.186 A:middle
values, such as required,

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:27.376 A:middle
meaning that your annotation

00:29:27.376 --> 00:29:29.026 A:middle
must always be shown on the map,

00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:30.966 A:middle
but also, high and low display

00:29:30.966 --> 00:29:31.546 A:middle
priority.

00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:33.176 A:middle
So, when the sighting is clear,

00:29:33.176 --> 00:29:34.466 A:middle
I will set a high display

00:29:34.466 --> 00:29:35.036 A:middle
priority.

00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:36.916 A:middle
When it's not, I will set a low

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:37.736 A:middle
display priority.

00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:40.296 A:middle
And finally, I will also encode

00:29:40.296 --> 00:29:41.746 A:middle
that information as the color of

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.306 A:middle
my annotation so that the users

00:29:43.306 --> 00:29:45.636 A:middle
can understand better why an

00:29:45.636 --> 00:29:47.416 A:middle
annotation was shown or now.

00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:49.846 A:middle
So, when it's brown, it's a

00:29:49.846 --> 00:29:51.226 A:middle
clear annotation and when it's

00:29:51.226 --> 00:29:52.526 A:middle
great, it was not so clear.

00:29:53.276 --> 00:29:54.236 A:middle
So, let's see the difference

00:29:54.236 --> 00:29:55.036 A:middle
that this makes.

00:29:56.856 --> 00:29:58.316 A:middle
So, now you can see that the map

00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:00.316 A:middle
is much cleaner because all of
