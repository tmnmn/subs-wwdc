00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.606 A:middle
But let's focus, let's be

00:49:01.606 --> 00:49:03.326 A:middle
positive and focus on the cases

00:49:03.326 --> 00:49:05.716 A:middle
where the request succeeds, and

00:49:05.716 --> 00:49:07.836 A:middle
in this case, I will have a list

00:49:07.836 --> 00:49:09.836 A:middle
of routes and I will create a

00:49:09.836 --> 00:49:11.376 A:middle
new polyline overlay for every

00:49:11.376 --> 00:49:11.926 A:middle
one of them.

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.836 A:middle
I will use my trusty Show Items

00:49:14.836 --> 00:49:17.226 A:middle
Method on the map to add these

00:49:17.226 --> 00:49:18.486 A:middle
routes and make sure that they

00:49:18.486 --> 00:49:19.656 A:middle
are being shown by setting the

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.276 A:middle
region to enclose the routes.

00:49:21.896 --> 00:49:24.366 A:middle
And let me introduce a couple

00:49:24.366 --> 00:49:26.236 A:middle
more options in that method.

00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:27.756 A:middle
The first one is Animate,

00:49:28.166 --> 00:49:29.286 A:middle
because I wanted to make sure

00:49:29.286 --> 00:49:31.296 A:middle
that there is a smooth animation

00:49:31.296 --> 00:49:32.976 A:middle
from the current region of the

00:49:32.976 --> 00:49:36.466 A:middle
map to the one where the routes

00:49:36.466 --> 00:49:37.036 A:middle
are shown.

00:49:38.616 --> 00:49:39.796 A:middle
And finally, I will also add

00:49:39.796 --> 00:49:41.246 A:middle
some padding so that I can keep

00:49:41.246 --> 00:49:42.826 A:middle
some of the context and not

00:49:42.826 --> 00:49:44.336 A:middle
constrict the region too much

00:49:44.336 --> 00:49:45.486 A:middle
around the routes.

00:49:46.716 --> 00:49:50.436 A:middle
So, I'm now ready to request

00:49:50.436 --> 00:49:52.876 A:middle
routes from the - this

00:49:52.876 --> 00:49:54.476 A:middle
convention center to an

00:49:54.476 --> 00:49:54.996 A:middle
annotation.

00:49:54.996 --> 00:49:56.466 A:middle
So, let's select this one again.

00:49:57.436 --> 00:49:59.406 A:middle
And now that my annotation has

00:49:59.406 --> 00:50:01.506 A:middle
been selected, the request has
