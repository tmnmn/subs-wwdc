00:15:58.046 --> 00:16:01.016 A:middle
are showing.

00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:02.486 A:middle
We'll see how to set the center

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:03.806 A:middle
in the region, how to add

00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:05.466 A:middle
annotations to the map to mark

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:07.066 A:middle
locations, and how to cover the

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.276 A:middle
-- some areas of the map with

00:16:08.276 --> 00:16:08.806 A:middle
overlays.

00:16:08.966 --> 00:16:10.696 A:middle
So, starting with the center and

00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:13.696 A:middle
the region of the map, again,

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:15.226 A:middle
this is the default map.

00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:18.166 A:middle
And it shows the default region,

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:20.646 A:middle
which is zooming out at the

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.126 A:middle
minimum possible level.

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:24.496 A:middle
And centering the map on, zero,

00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:26.056 A:middle
zero, latitude and longitude.

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:28.546 A:middle
You probably want to show a more

00:16:28.546 --> 00:16:29.836 A:middle
specific area of the world.

00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:32.046 A:middle
So, for this example, I want to

00:16:32.046 --> 00:16:34.006 A:middle
focus on Rio de Janeiro in

00:16:34.006 --> 00:16:34.396 A:middle
Brazil.

00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:36.466 A:middle
And to do that, I will set the

00:16:36.466 --> 00:16:37.976 A:middle
center of my map to the

00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:39.426 A:middle
coordinate of Rio de Janeiro.

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:40.446 A:middle
So, you can see on the right,

00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:43.466 A:middle
that the map center has moved to

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:45.006 A:middle
show Rio at is center.

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:47.216 A:middle
But setting the center of the

00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:48.636 A:middle
map does not change the scale.

00:16:48.636 --> 00:16:49.966 A:middle
So, at this scale, we are always

00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:51.256 A:middle
still not very much in focus

00:16:51.256 --> 00:16:52.546 A:middle
because we can see all of South

00:16:52.546 --> 00:16:53.356 A:middle
America, for instance.

00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:55.166 A:middle
So, let's zoom in a little bit.

00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:57.966 A:middle
And in order to do that, I will

00:16:57.966 --> 00:16:59.086 A:middle
set a region.

00:16:59.376 --> 00:17:01.286 A:middle
So, a coordinate region is made
