00:27:58.816 --> 00:28:00.566 A:middle
I will create an annotation for

00:28:00.566 --> 00:28:03.526 A:middle
each of them.

00:28:03.576 --> 00:28:05.746 A:middle
I will then make sure that my

00:28:05.746 --> 00:28:07.366 A:middle
sightings are shown on the map.

00:28:07.796 --> 00:28:09.066 A:middle
My annotations are shown on the

00:28:09.066 --> 00:28:09.256 A:middle
map.

00:28:09.516 --> 00:28:10.726 A:middle
And I will use the Show Items

00:28:10.726 --> 00:28:12.366 A:middle
method, which is very convenient

00:28:12.366 --> 00:28:14.316 A:middle
because not only it ensures that

00:28:14.316 --> 00:28:16.086 A:middle
the items are visible, but also

00:28:16.086 --> 00:28:17.986 A:middle
that they are added to the map.

00:28:18.626 --> 00:28:20.396 A:middle
And since I'm doing a webpage, I

00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:21.856 A:middle
can also add some extra

00:28:21.856 --> 00:28:23.376 A:middle
information on my page such as

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:24.656 A:middle
how many sightings there were in

00:28:24.656 --> 00:28:25.126 A:middle
this area.

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:29.316 A:middle
So, let me make sure that I save

00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:33.926 A:middle
and by reloading, I now see a

00:28:33.926 --> 00:28:36.236 A:middle
map with 60 sightings on it.

00:28:36.696 --> 00:28:38.166 A:middle
So, all of these annotations are

00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:39.816 A:middle
sightings and we run into the

00:28:39.816 --> 00:28:40.686 A:middle
problem that I've just

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:42.196 A:middle
highlighted which is that in

00:28:42.196 --> 00:28:44.086 A:middle
this park area, I can see lots

00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:45.726 A:middle
of sightings happening, and they

00:28:45.726 --> 00:28:46.836 A:middle
all overlap each other.

00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:48.936 A:middle
And even as I zoom in, I can see

00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:50.416 A:middle
that there's still lots of

00:28:50.716 --> 00:28:52.236 A:middle
clutter, so I will clean that up

00:28:52.616 --> 00:28:54.066 A:middle
using the Display Priority

00:28:54.506 --> 00:28:56.506 A:middle
Property on Annotations.

00:28:57.886 --> 00:28:59.916 A:middle
So, in order to choose a display

00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:01.416 A:middle
priority, what I will use is I
