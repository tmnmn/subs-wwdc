00:43:58.476 --> 00:44:00.386 A:middle
is that even though it can tell

00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:02.916 A:middle
us where we are, and it can tell

00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:05.236 A:middle
us where Bigfoot is, it doesn't

00:44:05.236 --> 00:44:06.416 A:middle
yet tell us how to get there.

00:44:07.536 --> 00:44:08.986 A:middle
So, I'm going to add some

00:44:08.986 --> 00:44:11.876 A:middle
directions from All Current

00:44:11.876 --> 00:44:13.086 A:middle
Location, which is the McEnery

00:44:13.086 --> 00:44:15.686 A:middle
Convention Center, to these

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.366 A:middle
Bigfoot locations.

00:44:17.596 --> 00:44:19.276 A:middle
I will use the MapKit JS

00:44:19.276 --> 00:44:20.956 A:middle
direction services to do that.

00:44:21.396 --> 00:44:22.816 A:middle
I will use polyline overlays to

00:44:22.816 --> 00:44:23.296 A:middle
draw them.

00:44:24.206 --> 00:44:25.666 A:middle
But the first thing I need to do

00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:28.206 A:middle
is I need to make sure that the

00:44:28.206 --> 00:44:30.816 A:middle
user - I need to find a way so

00:44:30.816 --> 00:44:32.116 A:middle
that the user can tell me which

00:44:32.116 --> 00:44:33.306 A:middle
one of these sightings they want

00:44:33.456 --> 00:44:33.886 A:middle
to see.

00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:37.326 A:middle
So, well, this one is selected,

00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:38.676 A:middle
so that's probably the one that

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.056 A:middle
the user wants to see, right?

00:44:40.426 --> 00:44:42.156 A:middle
So, this is what we will do.

00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:44.446 A:middle
We will use the Select Event

00:44:44.446 --> 00:44:46.826 A:middle
Listener from the map to listen

00:44:46.826 --> 00:44:48.496 A:middle
to annotation selections from

00:44:48.496 --> 00:44:49.256 A:middle
the user.

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:50.816 A:middle
And when an annotation is

00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:52.326 A:middle
selected, that means they might

00:44:52.326 --> 00:44:54.036 A:middle
be interested in knowing how to

00:44:54.036 --> 00:44:56.226 A:middle
see that specific location.

00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:59.326 A:middle
So, we will request a route and

00:44:59.326 --> 00:45:01.226 A:middle
draw it so that they can see how
