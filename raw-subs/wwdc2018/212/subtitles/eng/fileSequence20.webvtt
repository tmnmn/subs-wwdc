00:19:58.526 --> 00:20:00.986 A:middle
We follow the model of DOM Event

00:20:00.986 --> 00:20:02.556 A:middle
Handling, so you will have the

00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:04.216 A:middle
familiar method such as Add

00:20:04.216 --> 00:20:05.396 A:middle
Event Listener and Remove Event

00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:07.536 A:middle
Listener, the name of the event,

00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:09.256 A:middle
and you get past an event object

00:20:09.256 --> 00:20:10.516 A:middle
with the parameters of the

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:10.826 A:middle
event.

00:20:11.146 --> 00:20:13.006 A:middle
So, for instance, if I wanted to

00:20:13.006 --> 00:20:15.376 A:middle
refresh my map with some new

00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:16.856 A:middle
information every time the user

00:20:16.856 --> 00:20:18.166 A:middle
has mapped to a different area,

00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:20.076 A:middle
I can listen to region change

00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:22.106 A:middle
and events, and that will let me

00:20:22.106 --> 00:20:23.836 A:middle
know that the map has settled to

00:20:23.836 --> 00:20:25.616 A:middle
a new place, and I can now use

00:20:25.616 --> 00:20:27.866 A:middle
the region of that map to

00:20:28.216 --> 00:20:30.876 A:middle
compute which information I

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:34.586 A:middle
wanted to show at this stage.

00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:36.816 A:middle
Now, that we know how to set up

00:20:36.816 --> 00:20:38.416 A:middle
a map, let's add some our own

00:20:38.416 --> 00:20:39.346 A:middle
information on it.

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:40.606 A:middle
And we can do that with

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.686 A:middle
annotations and overlay.

00:20:41.686 --> 00:20:43.046 A:middle
We'll start with annotations.

00:20:43.126 --> 00:20:44.506 A:middle
And MapKit JS provides three

00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:45.496 A:middle
kinds of annotations.

00:20:45.496 --> 00:20:46.576 A:middle
The first one, you've had a

00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:48.276 A:middle
quick peek at it, which is the

00:20:48.276 --> 00:20:49.236 A:middle
Marker Annotation.

00:20:50.546 --> 00:20:52.036 A:middle
You can customize annotations

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:53.606 A:middle
further than the -- what the

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:54.986 A:middle
marker annotation provides by

00:20:54.986 --> 00:20:57.406 A:middle
using images, or even DOM

00:20:57.406 --> 00:20:58.566 A:middle
Elements that will have

00:20:58.566 --> 00:21:00.166 A:middle
completely customizable
