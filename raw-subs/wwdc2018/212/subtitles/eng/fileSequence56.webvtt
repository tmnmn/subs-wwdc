00:55:58.036 --> 00:56:00.406 A:middle
That it lets you unify on a

00:56:00.406 --> 00:56:02.036 A:middle
single map provider with a

00:56:02.036 --> 00:56:03.456 A:middle
familiar and flexible API.

00:56:03.456 --> 00:56:04.736 A:middle
So, if you have on your team

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.496 A:middle
people who have used the native

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:07.976 A:middle
MapKit API, this would feel

00:56:07.976 --> 00:56:09.656 A:middle
right at home, because the same

00:56:09.656 --> 00:56:10.426 A:middle
concepts apply.

00:56:10.766 --> 00:56:12.416 A:middle
And web developers will be happy

00:56:12.416 --> 00:56:14.846 A:middle
to see that the APIs are also

00:56:14.846 --> 00:56:16.936 A:middle
tailored to match JavaScript.

00:56:18.796 --> 00:56:20.516 A:middle
So, I will remind you that you

00:56:20.516 --> 00:56:22.276 A:middle
need the MapKit JS Key to be

00:56:22.276 --> 00:56:23.716 A:middle
able to use MapKit JS.

00:56:23.716 --> 00:56:25.326 A:middle
So, please go to the developer

00:56:25.326 --> 00:56:26.986 A:middle
portal, get your key, and try it

00:56:26.986 --> 00:56:27.526 A:middle
out today.

00:56:28.976 --> 00:56:30.346 A:middle
If you want to know more about

00:56:30.346 --> 00:56:32.026 A:middle
MapKit JS, you can find the

00:56:32.026 --> 00:56:34.726 A:middle
documentation and sample code at

00:56:34.726 --> 00:56:35.386 A:middle
this URL.

00:56:36.066 --> 00:56:38.946 A:middle
And if you want to know more

00:56:38.946 --> 00:56:40.596 A:middle
about this session, you have

00:56:40.596 --> 00:56:42.836 A:middle
this URL for the session itself.

00:56:42.906 --> 00:56:45.606 A:middle
We have accompanying video that

00:56:45.606 --> 00:56:47.106 A:middle
will take you step-by-step

00:56:47.106 --> 00:56:48.536 A:middle
through getting and using a

00:56:48.536 --> 00:56:51.246 A:middle
MapKit JS Key.

00:56:51.246 --> 00:56:52.656 A:middle
And finally, we have labs

00:56:52.656 --> 00:56:55.046 A:middle
happening on Wednesday morning

00:56:55.046 --> 00:56:56.486 A:middle
and Friday morning, so you can

00:56:56.486 --> 00:56:58.466 A:middle
come to talk to the whole MapKit

00:56:58.466 --> 00:57:00.526 A:middle
JS team to ask us questions
