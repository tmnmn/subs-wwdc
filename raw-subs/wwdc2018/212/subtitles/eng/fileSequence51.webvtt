00:50:59.026 --> 00:51:00.036 A:middle
with my old style.

00:51:00.656 --> 00:51:01.836 A:middle
So, this style will keep the

00:51:01.836 --> 00:51:02.666 A:middle
same opacity.

00:51:02.666 --> 00:51:04.756 A:middle
We will make the line figure and

00:51:04.756 --> 00:51:06.126 A:middle
we will make it purple so that

00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:07.406 A:middle
it stands out from the other

00:51:07.406 --> 00:51:07.866 A:middle
ones.

00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:11.506 A:middle
But now, we need to apply this

00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:13.216 A:middle
style to my overlay once it's

00:51:13.216 --> 00:51:13.746 A:middle
selected.

00:51:14.106 --> 00:51:15.826 A:middle
Fortunately, I already have an

00:51:15.826 --> 00:51:19.206 A:middle
event handler for selections.

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:22.236 A:middle
And up to that point, we were

00:51:22.236 --> 00:51:24.376 A:middle
only interested in listening to

00:51:24.376 --> 00:51:26.346 A:middle
annotation being selected.

00:51:26.576 --> 00:51:28.906 A:middle
But now we will just add a new

00:51:28.906 --> 00:51:30.166 A:middle
-- we will add plans to this

00:51:30.166 --> 00:51:31.096 A:middle
function.

00:51:31.746 --> 00:51:33.786 A:middle
Oops.

00:51:36.606 --> 00:51:38.196 A:middle
So now, if annotation is

00:51:38.196 --> 00:51:39.686 A:middle
selected, I still do the same

00:51:39.686 --> 00:51:40.746 A:middle
thing that I was doing, but if

00:51:40.746 --> 00:51:42.466 A:middle
an overlay's selected, I will

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.046 A:middle
change its style to be the

00:51:44.046 --> 00:51:45.726 A:middle
selected route style that I've

00:51:45.726 --> 00:51:47.896 A:middle
just defined, so that it is

00:51:48.066 --> 00:51:48.696 A:middle
highlighted.

00:51:49.866 --> 00:51:51.226 A:middle
So, let's see this in action.

00:51:54.606 --> 00:51:56.776 A:middle
We can use a different one.

00:51:56.776 --> 00:51:58.596 A:middle
I'm feeling lucky.
