00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:02.306 A:middle
With a circle overlay, you can

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:03.926 A:middle
show all of the distances -- or

00:34:03.926 --> 00:34:05.176 A:middle
the distances from a point.

00:34:05.356 --> 00:34:06.836 A:middle
With a polyline overlay, we can

00:34:06.836 --> 00:34:08.315 A:middle
show a route between two points.

00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:10.106 A:middle
And you can highlight

00:34:10.326 --> 00:34:12.585 A:middle
geographical areas such as a

00:34:12.585 --> 00:34:14.826 A:middle
state, the boundaries of a

00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:16.335 A:middle
country or a city, etcetera,

00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:17.706 A:middle
using a polygon overlay.

00:34:18.936 --> 00:34:21.156 A:middle
So, here is an example of a

00:34:21.156 --> 00:34:21.916 A:middle
circle overlay.

00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:25.246 A:middle
So, now I'm in Brussels and I've

00:34:25.246 --> 00:34:26.646 A:middle
centered my map on the Manneken

00:34:26.646 --> 00:34:26.976 A:middle
Pis.

00:34:27.806 --> 00:34:30.406 A:middle
And this is right in the center

00:34:30.406 --> 00:34:31.996 A:middle
of the city and this is a very

00:34:31.996 --> 00:34:33.025 A:middle
nice place to walk around.

00:34:33.536 --> 00:34:35.496 A:middle
So, by using concentric circles

00:34:35.496 --> 00:34:38.716 A:middle
around my location of increasing

00:34:38.716 --> 00:34:40.386 A:middle
radius, I can see walking

00:34:40.386 --> 00:34:41.025 A:middle
distances.

00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:43.795 A:middle
So, here I've created overlays

00:34:43.795 --> 00:34:44.996 A:middle
with their coordinates, and the

00:34:44.996 --> 00:34:46.255 A:middle
second parameter that you need

00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:48.426 A:middle
to give to a circle overlay, is

00:34:48.426 --> 00:34:49.876 A:middle
a radius expressed in meter.

00:34:50.156 --> 00:34:52.136 A:middle
So here, every overlay has a

00:34:52.136 --> 00:34:54.106 A:middle
radius starting from 400 meters,

00:34:54.106 --> 00:34:55.436 A:middle
increasing by 400 meters.

00:34:55.436 --> 00:34:56.815 A:middle
So, 400, 800, etcetera.

00:34:57.726 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
So, I can see in the right, that
