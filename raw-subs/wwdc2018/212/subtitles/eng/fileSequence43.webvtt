00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:01.646 A:middle
By default, the transportation

00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:02.946 A:middle
type is by automobile.

00:43:03.236 --> 00:43:04.306 A:middle
You can switch this using the

00:43:04.306 --> 00:43:06.326 A:middle
transport enum to walking

00:43:06.326 --> 00:43:06.856 A:middle
directions.

00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:08.176 A:middle
We won't keep that, because

00:43:08.176 --> 00:43:09.436 A:middle
that's a really far way to walk,

00:43:10.246 --> 00:43:11.376 A:middle
but we will use Request

00:43:11.376 --> 00:43:12.126 A:middle
Alternate Routes.

00:43:12.746 --> 00:43:13.796 A:middle
You can use this to provide

00:43:13.796 --> 00:43:15.416 A:middle
multiple options to your users.

00:43:15.786 --> 00:43:16.996 A:middle
This way we can display

00:43:17.266 --> 00:43:19.006 A:middle
different routes instead of the

00:43:19.006 --> 00:43:21.236 A:middle
default of one optimal route.

00:43:22.536 --> 00:43:23.916 A:middle
And then finally, you can

00:43:23.916 --> 00:43:26.496 A:middle
display your results on the map.

00:43:26.496 --> 00:43:28.146 A:middle
Here we have polyline overlays

00:43:28.146 --> 00:43:29.236 A:middle
as you've seen earlier.

00:43:29.546 --> 00:43:31.026 A:middle
And you also get a set of route

00:43:31.026 --> 00:43:32.986 A:middle
steps as well as the distance

00:43:32.986 --> 00:43:33.926 A:middle
and the travel time.

00:43:34.226 --> 00:43:35.386 A:middle
So, those are the services.

00:43:35.386 --> 00:43:36.356 A:middle
Now, that you're more familiar

00:43:36.356 --> 00:43:37.856 A:middle
with them, Julien will come back

00:43:37.856 --> 00:43:39.976 A:middle
up for a demo.

00:43:40.516 --> 00:43:45.056 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Melody.

00:43:46.826 --> 00:43:48.316 A:middle
So, we will pick up where we

00:43:48.316 --> 00:43:50.716 A:middle
left off and we will continue

00:43:50.716 --> 00:43:52.246 A:middle
building our Bigfoot Finder.

00:43:53.906 --> 00:43:54.926 A:middle
And there's one things that's

00:43:54.926 --> 00:43:58.116 A:middle
really missing from this finder,

00:43:58.476 --> 00:44:00.386 A:middle
is that even though it can tell
