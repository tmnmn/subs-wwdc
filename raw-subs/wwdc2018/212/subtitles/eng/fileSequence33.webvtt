00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:01.416 A:middle
And these elements are created

00:33:01.416 --> 00:33:03.626 A:middle
on demand for your annotations.

00:33:03.866 --> 00:33:04.986 A:middle
So, let's see an example.

00:33:04.986 --> 00:33:07.906 A:middle
Here, if I wanted to do just

00:33:07.906 --> 00:33:09.876 A:middle
some color for any pin that

00:33:09.876 --> 00:33:12.746 A:middle
shows up on my map, then I will

00:33:12.746 --> 00:33:13.906 A:middle
create an annotation with a

00:33:13.906 --> 00:33:14.786 A:middle
coordinate [inaudible].

00:33:14.786 --> 00:33:16.496 A:middle
And a third parameter which is a

00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:18.086 A:middle
function that we will return a

00:33:18.086 --> 00:33:19.536 A:middle
DOM Element for that annotation.

00:33:19.966 --> 00:33:21.016 A:middle
So, in this case, I will use a

00:33:21.016 --> 00:33:21.856 A:middle
Canvas Element.

00:33:22.356 --> 00:33:23.636 A:middle
I create a Canvas Element.

00:33:23.636 --> 00:33:24.906 A:middle
I get .Context.

00:33:24.906 --> 00:33:26.156 A:middle
I drew a pin image in that

00:33:26.156 --> 00:33:26.656 A:middle
Canvas.

00:33:27.056 --> 00:33:28.936 A:middle
I changed the head of the pin to

00:33:28.936 --> 00:33:30.366 A:middle
the color that I want, and I

00:33:30.366 --> 00:33:31.256 A:middle
returned to Canvas.

00:33:31.256 --> 00:33:32.966 A:middle
And this is the Canvas that is

00:33:32.966 --> 00:33:34.376 A:middle
shown on the map for this

00:33:34.376 --> 00:33:35.116 A:middle
annotation.

00:33:37.366 --> 00:33:38.826 A:middle
So, these were the three kinds

00:33:38.826 --> 00:33:39.936 A:middle
of annotations that you could

00:33:39.936 --> 00:33:40.306 A:middle
use.

00:33:40.736 --> 00:33:42.336 A:middle
But sometimes you want to show

00:33:42.336 --> 00:33:44.716 A:middle
more than just a single location

00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:47.026 A:middle
or a set of single locations.

00:33:47.156 --> 00:33:48.796 A:middle
Sometimes you want to call -- to

00:33:48.796 --> 00:33:50.826 A:middle
show complete areas on your map.

00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:53.616 A:middle
And to do that, we have overlays

00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:54.976 A:middle
and we have -- we provide three

00:33:54.976 --> 00:33:56.206 A:middle
different kinds of overlays.

00:33:56.716 --> 00:33:58.466 A:middle
And here are some examples of

00:33:58.466 --> 00:33:59.366 A:middle
how you could use them.
