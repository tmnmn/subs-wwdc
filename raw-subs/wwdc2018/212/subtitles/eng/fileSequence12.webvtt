00:11:57.096 --> 00:12:00.156 A:middle
Zoom or the Compass, because we

00:12:00.156 --> 00:12:03.346 A:middle
have gestures to change the

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:04.686 A:middle
rotation of the map or to zoom

00:12:04.686 --> 00:12:04.856 A:middle
in.

00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:07.316 A:middle
So again, we don't really need

00:12:07.316 --> 00:12:09.186 A:middle
to use up that space by showing

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:10.496 A:middle
these controls, and we turn them

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:11.146 A:middle
off by default.

00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:14.496 A:middle
Note that the Apple logo and the

00:12:14.496 --> 00:12:15.946 A:middle
legal text are always present.

00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:18.146 A:middle
These are the difference for the

00:12:18.146 --> 00:12:20.086 A:middle
controls, but you can also set

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:21.896 A:middle
these control visibilities

00:12:21.896 --> 00:12:22.646 A:middle
yourself.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:23.846 A:middle
Some controls are so-called

00:12:23.846 --> 00:12:24.806 A:middle
Adaptive Controls.

00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:25.976 A:middle
This includes the Compass and

00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:26.386 A:middle
the Scale.

00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:28.416 A:middle
This means that depending on the

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.116 A:middle
platform, they will behave in a

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.166 A:middle
slightly different manner.

00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:34.696 A:middle
So, on iOS, the Compass control

00:12:34.696 --> 00:12:36.196 A:middle
is not shown by default, but if

00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:37.876 A:middle
the map rotates, then we will

00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:39.666 A:middle
show it indicate where North is

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:40.136 A:middle
pointing.

00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:42.256 A:middle
And the Scale is an indicator of

00:12:42.306 --> 00:12:44.566 A:middle
the units of distance on your

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:44.846 A:middle
map.

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:47.226 A:middle
And we show it only when the

00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:48.506 A:middle
user is zooming in and out.

00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:52.016 A:middle
So, here, we can see the -- when

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:54.076 A:middle
we have zooming and rotation, we

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:55.666 A:middle
can see the Compass appear and

00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:56.826 A:middle
disappear in the bottom right

00:12:56.826 --> 00:12:57.226 A:middle
corner.

00:12:57.606 --> 00:12:58.636 A:middle
And the Scale appear and

00:12:58.636 --> 00:12:59.916 A:middle
disappear in the top left

00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:00.166 A:middle
corner.
