00:34:57.726 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
So, I can see in the right, that

00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:02.776 A:middle
there is a museum for comic

00:35:02.776 --> 00:35:03.316 A:middle
strip art.

00:35:03.316 --> 00:35:04.316 A:middle
That sounds interesting.

00:35:04.316 --> 00:35:05.666 A:middle
And it looks like it could be

00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:08.706 A:middle
between 1200 and then 1600

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:09.046 A:middle
meters.

00:35:09.046 --> 00:35:10.276 A:middle
So, about 10 to 15 minutes'

00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:11.046 A:middle
walk.

00:35:11.346 --> 00:35:13.366 A:middle
One important thing that I can

00:35:13.366 --> 00:35:14.676 A:middle
do with overlays, is I can also

00:35:14.676 --> 00:35:15.226 A:middle
style them.

00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:18.706 A:middle
So here, to represent this style

00:35:18.706 --> 00:35:20.826 A:middle
of overlay, I can use a MapKit

00:35:20.826 --> 00:35:23.776 A:middle
Style Object, which has several

00:35:23.776 --> 00:35:25.356 A:middle
properties such as the line

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.486 A:middle
width, the line depth, the

00:35:26.486 --> 00:35:28.566 A:middle
stroke color which again, can be

00:35:28.566 --> 00:35:29.516 A:middle
any CSS color.

00:35:29.956 --> 00:35:32.576 A:middle
By default, circle overlays are

00:35:32.656 --> 00:35:35.606 A:middle
filled with blue color, but in

00:35:35.606 --> 00:35:36.686 A:middle
this case, I want them to be

00:35:36.686 --> 00:35:37.226 A:middle
transparent.

00:35:37.226 --> 00:35:39.246 A:middle
So, I set the field color to be

00:35:39.246 --> 00:35:39.476 A:middle
null.

00:35:39.716 --> 00:35:42.846 A:middle
I have decided that I want to go

00:35:42.846 --> 00:35:45.086 A:middle
visit this comic strip museum,

00:35:45.656 --> 00:35:47.516 A:middle
and MapKit JS as we will show,

00:35:47.516 --> 00:35:49.956 A:middle
has services that can give you

00:35:50.036 --> 00:35:51.616 A:middle
walking and driving directions

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:52.396 A:middle
between two points.

00:35:52.816 --> 00:35:54.186 A:middle
So, in this case, I've asked for

00:35:54.186 --> 00:35:56.766 A:middle
directions from where I was, the

00:35:56.766 --> 00:35:58.036 A:middle
Manneken Pis, to where I want to

00:35:58.036 --> 00:35:58.356 A:middle
go.

00:35:58.776 --> 00:36:01.006 A:middle
I receive as a result, a route
