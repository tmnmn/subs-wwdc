00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
can use this binary mask and

00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:00.956 A:middle
create the effect.

00:30:01.596 --> 00:30:02.816 A:middle
The transition from background

00:30:02.816 --> 00:30:04.166 A:middle
to foreground will be very

00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:06.636 A:middle
sharp, but we'll get some

00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:07.826 A:middle
fidgeting around the edges.

00:30:09.486 --> 00:30:10.856 A:middle
So we want to filter it a bit.

00:30:11.826 --> 00:30:14.156 A:middle
The first stage will be to apply

00:30:14.156 --> 00:30:15.216 A:middle
some smoothing from the

00:30:15.216 --> 00:30:16.346 A:middle
background to the foreground, in

00:30:16.346 --> 00:30:17.896 A:middle
this case Gaussian Blurring.

00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:20.446 A:middle
The radius of Gaussian Blurring

00:30:20.446 --> 00:30:22.716 A:middle
will determine the slope of the

00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:25.096 A:middle
transition and you can play with

00:30:25.096 --> 00:30:26.696 A:middle
the value to get different

00:30:27.996 --> 00:30:28.526 A:middle
effects.

00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
Another processing stage we add

00:30:31.346 --> 00:30:33.966 A:middle
is gamma adjustments, it allows

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:35.286 A:middle
us to further fine-tune this

00:30:35.286 --> 00:30:36.456 A:middle
transition from background to

00:30:36.456 --> 00:30:36.976 A:middle
foreground.

00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:39.386 A:middle
If we use a gamma value which is

00:30:39.386 --> 00:30:41.576 A:middle
higher than one we'll get a

00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:43.156 A:middle
narrower foreground mask.

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.966 A:middle
On the other hand, if we use a

00:30:45.966 --> 00:30:47.526 A:middle
gamma value that is smaller than

00:30:47.526 --> 00:30:49.886 A:middle
one we'll get a wider foreground

00:30:49.886 --> 00:30:51.026 A:middle
mask and maybe some aura.

00:30:52.386 --> 00:30:53.646 A:middle
So you can create different

00:30:53.646 --> 00:30:56.286 A:middle
effects by combining those two

00:30:56.446 --> 00:30:57.136 A:middle
parameters.

00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:01.156 A:middle
If you use a large blur radius
