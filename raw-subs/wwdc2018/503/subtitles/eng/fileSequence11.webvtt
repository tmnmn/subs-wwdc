00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
vibrance to the image.

00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:04.706 A:middle
Now let's generate a background,

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.006 A:middle
in this case we'll do a disk

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:07.236 A:middle
blur which is another Core Image

00:11:07.236 --> 00:11:08.836 A:middle
filter, as well as bring down

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:09.996 A:middle
the exposure so things get

00:11:09.996 --> 00:11:10.746 A:middle
pretty dark.

00:11:10.746 --> 00:11:12.356 A:middle
But we still get a bit of

00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:13.386 A:middle
background remaining, it's quite

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:14.386 A:middle
faint but it's still there.

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:17.826 A:middle
And again, I use a CI blend with

00:11:17.826 --> 00:11:19.216 A:middle
mask which is going to do the

00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:20.716 A:middle
compositing for us with the mask

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:22.216 A:middle
and we have left and right.

00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:23.776 A:middle
Isn't this beautiful?

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:27.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.056 --> 00:11:29.276 A:middle
Thank you.

00:11:29.436 --> 00:11:30.476 A:middle
All right let's look at another

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:32.106 A:middle
great demo which we call Big

00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:32.386 A:middle
Head.

00:11:32.946 --> 00:11:36.326 A:middle
So because the portrait matte is

00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:37.806 A:middle
so fine we can actually do

00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:39.306 A:middle
things like change the

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:40.496 A:middle
[inaudible] size of our subject

00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:41.606 A:middle
with respect to the background

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:41.966 A:middle
using it.

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:44.506 A:middle
So let's do just that and we'll

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:45.006 A:middle
do it live.

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:48.536 A:middle
So here's our input image on the

00:11:48.536 --> 00:11:50.416 A:middle
left here and the portrait matte

00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:52.786 A:middle
on the right-hand side.

00:11:52.966 --> 00:11:55.056 A:middle
And what I'll be doing here as

00:11:55.056 --> 00:11:57.146 A:middle
I'll be playing with the size of

00:11:57.146 --> 00:11:59.616 A:middle
the subject in my frame notice

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.296 A:middle
how the subject is getting
