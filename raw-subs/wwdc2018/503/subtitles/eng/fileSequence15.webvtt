00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.526 A:middle
or the distance to the scene in

00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:00.976 A:middle
that direction.

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:06.296 A:middle
We've chosen a specific coloring

00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:08.466 A:middle
scheme, closed pixels are

00:15:08.466 --> 00:15:11.056 A:middle
colored in red while fire red

00:15:11.056 --> 00:15:12.306 A:middle
pixels are colored in blue.

00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:14.216 A:middle
In between them there is a

00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:16.426 A:middle
colorful spectrum so you can see

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:18.566 A:middle
the texture of the depth map.

00:15:20.156 --> 00:15:21.686 A:middle
There are also black pixels,

00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:23.636 A:middle
those are holes in a depth map.

00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:25.946 A:middle
For those pixels we have no

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:27.596 A:middle
information what is the depth.

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:30.796 A:middle
We are releasing today a new

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.936 A:middle
tool, a sample app for you to

00:15:32.936 --> 00:15:34.676 A:middle
explore this stream and we call

00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:36.526 A:middle
it TrueDepth Streamer.

00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:40.716 A:middle
You can slide between the video

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.976 A:middle
stream and the TrueDepth stream.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.716 A:middle
Now because the TrueDepth camera

00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:51.936 A:middle
has active illumination even in

00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:53.676 A:middle
complete darkness while the

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:56.966 A:middle
video is pitch black it is

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:58.186 A:middle
business as usual for the

00:15:58.186 --> 00:15:59.026 A:middle
TrueDepth camera.
