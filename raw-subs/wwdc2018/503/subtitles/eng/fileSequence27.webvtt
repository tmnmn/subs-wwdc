00:26:59.766 --> 00:27:01.516 A:middle
so we cannot transform it to X,

00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:02.856 A:middle
Y, Z and we would need to

00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:03.816 A:middle
discard this point.

00:27:05.196 --> 00:27:06.786 A:middle
If it is a real value we can

00:27:06.786 --> 00:27:09.286 A:middle
sample the RGB texture and add

00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:11.366 A:middle
color to the fragment or point

00:27:11.366 --> 00:27:14.746 A:middle
in this case.

00:27:14.956 --> 00:27:17.356 A:middle
So I understand this part was a

00:27:17.356 --> 00:27:19.066 A:middle
bit technical and a lot of you

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:20.276 A:middle
come from different backgrounds.

00:27:21.016 --> 00:27:22.876 A:middle
Have no fear we have just the

00:27:22.876 --> 00:27:25.056 A:middle
app for you, an app to replace

00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:26.756 A:middle
your background, let's see it

00:27:26.756 --> 00:27:26.906 A:middle
live.

00:27:38.046 --> 00:27:40.926 A:middle
Let's see it live.

00:27:41.136 --> 00:27:43.516 A:middle
So I can put myself in Yosemite,

00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:46.466 A:middle
I can swipe down put myself in

00:27:46.466 --> 00:27:47.466 A:middle
something more abstract.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:51.466 A:middle
I can even go all the way to

00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:53.006 A:middle
Antelope Canyon, Arizona, it

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:54.356 A:middle
took me 15 hours to get there

00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:55.846 A:middle
last time, I could have just

00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:57.426 A:middle
swiped down, saved a lot of

00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.126 A:middle
money on gas.

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:02.016 A:middle
In fact, this application can
