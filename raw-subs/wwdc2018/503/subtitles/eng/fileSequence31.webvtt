If you use a large blur radius

00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:02.866 A:middle
and a large gamma value you

00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:04.656 A:middle
create this transparent

00:31:04.656 --> 00:31:06.726 A:middle
transition that makes you seem

00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:08.486 A:middle
as if you're a hologram in space

00:31:09.546 --> 00:31:10.706 A:middle
or similarly it could be

00:31:10.706 --> 00:31:13.336 A:middle
underwater and you can play with

00:31:13.336 --> 00:31:15.146 A:middle
the values to create different

00:31:15.146 --> 00:31:15.576 A:middle
effects.

00:31:15.576 --> 00:31:17.936 A:middle
If I keep the radius high and

00:31:18.116 --> 00:31:19.766 A:middle
reduce the gamma value to a very

00:31:19.766 --> 00:31:22.186 A:middle
low number I create this halo

00:31:22.186 --> 00:31:22.756 A:middle
around my head.

00:31:23.406 --> 00:31:24.376 A:middle
So you can play with this to

00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:27.586 A:middle
create your own effects.

00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:31.266 A:middle
How do we implement this?

00:31:31.466 --> 00:31:33.026 A:middle
In Core Image it is very

00:31:33.026 --> 00:31:34.106 A:middle
straightforward, we can

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:35.896 A:middle
concatenate three filters in a

00:31:35.896 --> 00:31:36.166 A:middle
row.

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:38.516 A:middle
We start with a Gaussian Blur,

00:31:39.866 --> 00:31:42.656 A:middle
we add the gamma adjustment, and

00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:44.446 A:middle
we upscale to the RGB

00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:45.016 A:middle
resolution.

00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:48.306 A:middle
But there are a couple of small

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:49.756 A:middle
points I want to emphasize as

00:31:49.756 --> 00:31:50.686 A:middle
best practices.

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.176 A:middle
Anytime you work with a

00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:55.696 A:middle
convolutional based operation

00:31:55.696 --> 00:31:57.436 A:middle
such as Gaussian Blurring the

00:31:57.436 --> 00:31:59.466 A:middle
best practice will be to start

00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:00.696 A:middle
by clamping to extent.
