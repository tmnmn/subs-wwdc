00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
frames per second and we can

00:24:00.766 --> 00:24:01.996 A:middle
switch to the filtered stream

00:24:02.456 --> 00:24:04.866 A:middle
and then all the holes are

00:24:05.886 --> 00:24:06.026 A:middle
filled.

00:24:06.206 --> 00:24:07.446 A:middle
If I switch to the point cloud

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:10.076 A:middle
view I can dynamically change

00:24:11.636 --> 00:24:13.296 A:middle
the point of view to the scene.

00:24:14.276 --> 00:24:15.516 A:middle
So even though I'm looking

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:17.786 A:middle
directly to the device it looks

00:24:17.786 --> 00:24:19.136 A:middle
as if somebody's watching me

00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:19.846 A:middle
from up above.

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:22.516 A:middle
Now the reason we call this a

00:24:22.516 --> 00:24:25.076 A:middle
point cloud is if I zoom in you

00:24:25.076 --> 00:24:27.366 A:middle
can actually see the points in

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:28.156 A:middle
3-D space.

00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:32.016 A:middle
But being here with you in WWDC

00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:33.576 A:middle
I feel like I have to pinch

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:35.666 A:middle
myself just to get things back

00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:36.306 A:middle
in perspective.

00:24:39.516 --> 00:24:42.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:45.076 --> 00:24:47.396 A:middle
Thank you so that brings us to

00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
point clouds.

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:49.306 A:middle
How do we create them?

00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:51.426 A:middle
We're starting from a depth map,

00:24:51.826 --> 00:24:54.236 A:middle
a 2-D image in which the depth Z

00:24:54.716 --> 00:24:55.886 A:middle
is a function of the pixel

00:24:55.886 --> 00:24:57.056 A:middle
coordinates U and V.

00:24:58.486 --> 00:25:00.076 A:middle
And we want to transform it to a
