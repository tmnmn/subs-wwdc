00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
that simple.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.676 A:middle
AVFoundation also supports

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.236 A:middle
portrait matte delivery at

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:04.966 A:middle
capture time.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.176 A:middle
So starting with your typical

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.956 A:middle
AVFoundation setup with your

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.296 A:middle
AVCaptureInput, device, as well

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:12.126 A:middle
as capture session.

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:14.386 A:middle
The first thing you want to do

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.436 A:middle
is make sure that your

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:16.495 A:middle
environment supports the

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:17.736 A:middle
delivery of the portrait effects

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:17.986 A:middle
matte.

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.286 A:middle
To do this you'll be checking

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:21.636 A:middle
for is that data delivery

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.036 A:middle
supported, as well as is

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:24.176 A:middle
portrait effects matte delivery

00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:24.596 A:middle
supported.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:26.406 A:middle
The reason we have the two there

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:27.636 A:middle
both depth and portrait effects

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:28.496 A:middle
matte is that they come

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:29.046 A:middle
together.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.286 A:middle
You can either opt in to get

00:04:31.286 --> 00:04:32.976 A:middle
only the depth data, but

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:34.026 A:middle
whenever you want the portrait

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:35.516 A:middle
effects matte you also need to

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:36.716 A:middle
activate the depth data

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:37.216 A:middle
delivery.

00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:39.786 A:middle
And to activate or to opt in for

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:41.606 A:middle
that delivery make sure to

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:42.336 A:middle
modify your

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:44.146 A:middle
AVCapturePhotoSettings and set

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:45.336 A:middle
the isPortraitEffects

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.906 A:middle
MatteDelivery enabled, as well

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:48.806 A:middle
as isDepthDataDeliveryEnabled to

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:49.846 A:middle
true.

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.266 A:middle
Then the capture time your

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:53.776 A:middle
ddiFinishProcessingPhoto

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:55.086 A:middle
callback will give you the

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
portrait effects matte.

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:59.316 A:middle
It's really that simple.
