00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:00.436 A:middle
So we have the portrait depth on

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.206 A:middle
the left and the portrait matte

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:03.046 A:middle
on the right-hand side and you

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:04.116 A:middle
can just see how fine the

00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:04.796 A:middle
details are.

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:07.496 A:middle
And we'll do a zoom crop in just

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:09.896 A:middle
a minute so that you can better

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.126 A:middle
appreciate just how high quality

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:13.066 A:middle
it is.

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:15.686 A:middle
Then next thing we do is we

00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:16.586 A:middle
resize the images.

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:18.966 A:middle
As you see the RGB and the depth

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:20.596 A:middle
data vary greatly in size.

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:23.516 A:middle
So we resize our images and

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:24.426 A:middle
let's have a look at them

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:25.126 A:middle
side-by-side.

00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:26.686 A:middle
So we have our RGB and our depth

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:27.536 A:middle
data on the right-hand side.

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:29.076 A:middle
During the first part of this

00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:30.876 A:middle
demo I'll focus on depth data,

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.806 A:middle
then we'll see how things get

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:33.946 A:middle
much, much simpler when you use

00:07:33.946 --> 00:07:34.846 A:middle
a portrait effects matte.

00:07:35.596 --> 00:07:37.806 A:middle
So the effect I'm going to be

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:39.296 A:middle
working on today is depth

00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:41.346 A:middle
thresholding and essentially

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:42.426 A:middle
what I'll be doing is computing

00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:43.576 A:middle
a histogram of the gray level

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.316 A:middle
values in my portrait depth.

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:47.596 A:middle
And I'll be applying a threshold

00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:48.536 A:middle
or a clipping point in that

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:49.636 A:middle
histogram so that everything

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.516 A:middle
becomes zero or one depending if

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:52.986 A:middle
it's sitting below or above that

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:53.426 A:middle
threshold.

00:07:54.346 --> 00:07:55.886 A:middle
Then we'll be closing holes in

00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:57.336 A:middle
the image by using morphological

00:07:57.336 --> 00:07:59.116 A:middle
closing operations and then

00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:01.386 A:middle
blurring the mask so that we get
