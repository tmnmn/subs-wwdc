00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.076 A:middle
Okay so as you saw that required

00:10:02.076 --> 00:10:02.926 A:middle
a bit of fiddling with the

00:10:02.926 --> 00:10:04.096 A:middle
parameters for clipping, for

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:05.666 A:middle
smoothing, and then so on and so

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:06.096 A:middle
forth.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.366 A:middle
The portrait effects matte

00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:10.406 A:middle
enables you to do this without

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:11.666 A:middle
actually doing much process,

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:12.816 A:middle
this is really exciting so let's

00:10:12.816 --> 00:10:13.386 A:middle
have a look at this.

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:15.506 A:middle
So here we're starting with

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:19.086 A:middle
another image that also has

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:20.646 A:middle
portrait depth and portrait

00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:22.386 A:middle
matte information embedded into

00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:23.486 A:middle
it, so let's look at these.

00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:27.056 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, this is

00:10:27.056 --> 00:10:28.846 A:middle
an extremely high-quality

00:10:28.956 --> 00:10:29.666 A:middle
foreground mask.

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:31.056 A:middle
So let's have a look at a crop

00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:33.376 A:middle
on this hair.

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:36.846 A:middle
Look at how fine the detail is,

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:37.456 A:middle
this is beautiful.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:38.526 A:middle
On the right-hand side here is

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:39.676 A:middle
the depth that it shows you just

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:42.436 A:middle
how coarse the depth data is

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:43.586 A:middle
compared to effect matte.

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:46.036 A:middle
So we'll do another foreground

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:47.886 A:middle
separation effect here similarly

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:49.016 A:middle
to what we just did but we used

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:49.956 A:middle
a portrait matte instead of

00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:50.816 A:middle
using the portrait depth.

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.736 A:middle
So let's look at our foreground

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.606 A:middle
similar as before but in this

00:10:55.606 --> 00:10:56.656 A:middle
case, we'll desaturate the

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.856 A:middle
foreground slightly, add a bit

00:10:57.856 --> 00:10:59.746 A:middle
of contrast, as well as some

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
vibrance to the image.
