00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.296 A:middle
how the subject is getting

00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:02.416 A:middle
smaller and bigger.

00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:04.946 A:middle
And you can actually you know

00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
give more weight to the subject

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:09.046 A:middle
in your frame, but you can also

00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:11.106 A:middle
do pretty cool things like now

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.456 A:middle
that I have this let's say that

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.966 A:middle
I pick my favorite size here.

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:17.436 A:middle
You can do things like pseudo

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.346 A:middle
simulated depth of field here by

00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.276 A:middle
giving more contrast to the

00:12:20.276 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
foreground and using a

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:22.916 A:middle
[inaudible] in the background to

00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:24.136 A:middle
give more pop to your subject.

00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:28.006 A:middle
All right let's take a look at

00:12:28.006 --> 00:12:29.346 A:middle
just another image to see just

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:30.506 A:middle
how easy that is because they're

00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:32.226 A:middle
using the exact same pipeline

00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:33.176 A:middle
under the hood which is very

00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:34.486 A:middle
simple just using the portrait

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:36.376 A:middle
matte and using it to blur the

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:38.856 A:middle
foreground and background.

00:12:38.856 --> 00:12:40.096 A:middle
Again our input image here, we

00:12:40.096 --> 00:12:42.586 A:middle
can change the size of it, make

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.966 A:middle
it bigger, then apply a bit of

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:47.156 A:middle
contrast to give more focus to

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:47.736 A:middle
our subject.

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
It's that easy, really exciting.

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:55.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:57.186 A:middle
All right let's take a look at

00:12:57.186 --> 00:12:58.296 A:middle
another demo which we call

00:12:58.296 --> 00:12:58.956 A:middle
Marching.

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
I'm not even going to try to
