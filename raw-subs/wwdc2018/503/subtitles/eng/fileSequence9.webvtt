00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.746 A:middle
for this thresholding here and

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:02.676 A:middle
this is what I'll be using for

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:02.976 A:middle
my foreground.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:09.416 A:middle
Next, I'm applying an effect

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:10.536 A:middle
only on my foreground, so in

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:11.546 A:middle
this particular case I'm using

00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:12.936 A:middle
the Core Image photo effect Noir

00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:14.396 A:middle
which turns everything grayscale

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:15.556 A:middle
and has a has a bit of contrast.

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:17.206 A:middle
I'm doing an exposure

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:19.816 A:middle
adjustment, as well as

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:21.156 A:middle
desaturating my image slightly

00:09:21.156 --> 00:09:22.766 A:middle
and augmenting the contrast even

00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:23.196 A:middle
further.

00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:24.896 A:middle
Let's take a look at the output.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:25.716 A:middle
This is going to be the

00:09:25.716 --> 00:09:26.826 A:middle
foreground that I'll be using

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:28.936 A:middle
and what I want to do here is

00:09:29.016 --> 00:09:32.016 A:middle
leverage the depth data mask

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:33.756 A:middle
that I have to composite this

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:35.446 A:middle
foreground onto a background.

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:37.866 A:middle
Let's just generate a background

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.276 A:middle
which is just a darker version

00:09:39.396 --> 00:09:40.236 A:middle
of the original image.

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:43.816 A:middle
We can then composite the two

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.146 A:middle
together using the Core Image

00:09:45.146 --> 00:09:48.956 A:middle
filter blendWithMask and we have

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:50.186 A:middle
the result right there, it's

00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:50.726 A:middle
that simple.

00:09:51.386 --> 00:09:52.866 A:middle
All right.

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:54.936 A:middle
Thank you.

00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:58.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.076 A:middle
Okay so as you saw that required
