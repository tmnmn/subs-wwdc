00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:02.016 A:middle
In fact, this application can

00:28:02.016 --> 00:28:04.116 A:middle
even put you in space where

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:05.876 A:middle
nobody can hear you stream.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:15.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:19.036 A:middle
So how do we create that?

00:28:19.256 --> 00:28:21.586 A:middle
Anytime we're dealing with a

00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:23.706 A:middle
video application there's other

00:28:23.706 --> 00:28:25.476 A:middle
things that are going on a per

00:28:25.476 --> 00:28:28.456 A:middle
frame basis, in this case we

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:31.696 A:middle
have to detect a face, create a

00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:33.316 A:middle
brand-new mask from the depth

00:28:33.316 --> 00:28:36.056 A:middle
map, smooth and upscale it to

00:28:36.056 --> 00:28:37.286 A:middle
the RGB resolution.

00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:39.246 A:middle
And then we take this foreground

00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:41.536 A:middle
mask and upscale it again to the

00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:42.636 A:middle
low-light background image.

00:28:43.446 --> 00:28:44.616 A:middle
And then we can blend or

00:28:44.646 --> 00:28:46.876 A:middle
[inaudible] them, but there's

00:28:46.876 --> 00:28:49.336 A:middle
something we can do to reduce

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:50.416 A:middle
some of the complexity.

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:54.466 A:middle
If anytime we load a background

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.306 A:middle
image we resize it to the RGB

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.756 A:middle
resolution just once not

00:28:57.756 --> 00:28:59.556 A:middle
per-frame, then we don't need

00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:01.446 A:middle
that second upscale and the
