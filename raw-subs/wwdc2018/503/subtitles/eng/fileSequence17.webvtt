00:17:00.036 --> 00:17:01.666 A:middle
Know that if you work with depth

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:05.246 A:middle
that the depth error goes with

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:05.935 A:middle
the depth squared.

00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:08.096 A:middle
That means that an object at 1

00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:09.685 A:middle
meter would have four times the

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.826 A:middle
depth accuracy as an object at 2

00:17:11.826 --> 00:17:11.976 A:middle
meters.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.496 A:middle
We have two streams, video and

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.425 A:middle
depth, and they don't

00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:20.596 A:middle
necessarily share the same

00:17:20.596 --> 00:17:21.136 A:middle
resolution.

00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:23.006 A:middle
The native resolution of the

00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:24.596 A:middle
TrueDepth's camera is VGA or

00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:27.736 A:middle
640x480 and that's what you'll

00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:30.176 A:middle
get if you choose a video preset

00:17:30.656 --> 00:17:32.236 A:middle
of an aspect racial of 4:3.

00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:35.516 A:middle
If however you choose an aspect

00:17:35.516 --> 00:17:37.816 A:middle
ratio of 16x9 you'll get a depth

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:40.246 A:middle
map of 640x360.

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:42.916 A:middle
In both cases the depth map will

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:44.856 A:middle
cover the entire field of view

00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:46.146 A:middle
of the RGB image.

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.466 A:middle
Now we are talking about video

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:51.116 A:middle
applications, so we are

00:17:51.116 --> 00:17:52.946 A:middle
crunching a lot of numbers very,

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:54.956 A:middle
very fast and that could create

00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:57.266 A:middle
system pressure over time.

00:17:57.936 --> 00:17:59.696 A:middle
So you can test your application

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.306 A:middle
and gauge the system pressure
