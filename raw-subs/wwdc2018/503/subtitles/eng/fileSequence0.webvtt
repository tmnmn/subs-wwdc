&gt;&gt; Good morning, it's a pleasure

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:24.676 A:middle
to be here with you.

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:26.386 A:middle
My name is Emmanuel and I'm an

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:27.476 A:middle
engineer on the Core Image team.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:30.106 A:middle
This morning we'll be looking at

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:31.616 A:middle
creating photo and video effects

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.386 A:middle
using depth.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.686 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.976 A:middle
With iOS 11 we started

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:40.726 A:middle
delivering portrait depth data

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:41.816 A:middle
alongside your portrait still

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:42.206 A:middle
images.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.386 A:middle
During last year's WWDC sessions

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:46.746 A:middle
we showed how you can leverage

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.826 A:middle
that depth data to achieve

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:49.436 A:middle
amazing effects, such as force

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:51.446 A:middle
perspective, simulated depth of

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.996 A:middle
field effects, as well as

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:53.806 A:middle
various foreground and

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.286 A:middle
background separation effects.

00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:57.806 A:middle
This year we're extremely

00:00:57.806 --> 00:00:59.206 A:middle
excited to announce that we're

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:01.456 A:middle
coming out with a new feature, a
