00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:01.456 A:middle
coming out with a new feature, a

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:01.976 A:middle
portrait matte.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.036 A:middle
So during the first half of this

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:08.616 A:middle
session we'll be focusing on

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:09.696 A:middle
portrait still images and how

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:11.166 A:middle
you can apply really great

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:11.896 A:middle
effects on them.

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:14.366 A:middle
During the next half my

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.446 A:middle
colleague Ron over from video

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:17.176 A:middle
engineering will be focusing on

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
using a TrueDepth camera to

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:19.906 A:middle
achieve real-time video effects.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.076 A:middle
All right, let's take a look at

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.636 A:middle
the portrait segmentation API.

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:28.436 A:middle
So I mentioned a portrait matte,

00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:29.526 A:middle
so what is a portrait matte?

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:30.636 A:middle
A portrait matte is a

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:32.476 A:middle
segmentation from foreground to

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:33.856 A:middle
background and what this means

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:35.706 A:middle
precisely is that you have a

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.706 A:middle
mask which is 1.0 in the

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:40.576 A:middle
foreground and 0.0 in the

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:42.176 A:middle
background and you get soft and

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:42.976 A:middle
continuous values in between.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:47.646 A:middle
The portrait matte is of

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:49.116 A:middle
extremely high quality and is

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:50.626 A:middle
able to preserve fine details,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.666 A:middle
such as curl and hair on the

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:53.696 A:middle
outline of your subject.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:55.446 A:middle
This is amazing.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.646 A:middle
The matte can be used to achieve

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:01.666 A:middle
great many effects, here is just
