00:31:59.466 --> 00:32:00.696 A:middle
by clamping to extent.

00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:03.576 A:middle
By repeating the border pixels

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:06.446 A:middle
outwards we can make sure all

00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.566 A:middle
the borders of the image are

00:32:07.566 --> 00:32:10.996 A:middle
handled correctly by the filter.

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:13.236 A:middle
Moreover, after the filtering

00:32:13.236 --> 00:32:14.616 A:middle
and just before the upscaling

00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:16.286 A:middle
the best practice will be to

00:32:16.286 --> 00:32:18.386 A:middle
crop back to the original extent

00:32:18.886 --> 00:32:20.006 A:middle
because that's the part of the

00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:21.496 A:middle
image we really care about.

00:32:21.766 --> 00:32:25.816 A:middle
At this point we have an alpha

00:32:25.816 --> 00:32:27.766 A:middle
matte of the foreground and you

00:32:27.766 --> 00:32:29.096 A:middle
can use it to create different

00:32:29.096 --> 00:32:30.246 A:middle
kinds of effects for the

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:31.336 A:middle
background and the foreground

00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:33.006 A:middle
just like Emmanuel showed in the

00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:33.646 A:middle
first half.

00:32:34.076 --> 00:32:39.266 A:middle
In Backdrop, we blend the RGB

00:32:39.266 --> 00:32:41.136 A:middle
stream with a loaded background

00:32:41.136 --> 00:32:43.186 A:middle
image in a single line of Core

00:32:43.186 --> 00:32:45.016 A:middle
Image code using the alpha matte

00:32:45.016 --> 00:32:46.296 A:middle
we created from the TrueDepth

00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:48.706 A:middle
camera to create this background

00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:50.236 A:middle
replacement effect.

00:32:53.996 --> 00:32:57.056 A:middle
So the TrueDepth camera gives us

00:32:58.046 --> 00:32:59.416 A:middle
a resolution of depth map of

00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:02.576 A:middle
640x480 coming at you 30 frames
