00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:01.446 A:middle
that second upscale and the

00:29:01.446 --> 00:29:02.926 A:middle
blending is done at low

00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:04.376 A:middle
resolution which makes a big

00:29:04.376 --> 00:29:04.886 A:middle
difference.

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:07.716 A:middle
So let's deep dive into those

00:29:07.716 --> 00:29:08.086 A:middle
depths.

00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:10.606 A:middle
The first thing we need is to

00:29:10.606 --> 00:29:11.856 A:middle
find the center of the face.

00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:14.406 A:middle
And in iOS there are actually

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:16.386 A:middle
quite a few ways you can get

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:17.316 A:middle
face metadata.

00:29:18.296 --> 00:29:19.246 A:middle
You can use a Core Image

00:29:19.246 --> 00:29:20.706 A:middle
detector or the Vision

00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:22.796 A:middle
Framework, but in this case

00:29:22.976 --> 00:29:25.226 A:middle
since we just need the pixel at

00:29:25.226 --> 00:29:26.366 A:middle
the center of the face we can

00:29:26.366 --> 00:29:28.586 A:middle
use AV meta data object type

00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:29.056 A:middle
face.

00:29:30.426 --> 00:29:32.896 A:middle
But it gives us the center in

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:34.236 A:middle
the coding system of the RGB

00:29:34.236 --> 00:29:36.086 A:middle
image and we need to map it to

00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:38.196 A:middle
the depth map which might not be

00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:39.106 A:middle
in the same resolution.

00:29:41.356 --> 00:29:43.316 A:middle
Once we have the value of the

00:29:43.316 --> 00:29:45.886 A:middle
depth of the face we can use it

00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:47.566 A:middle
plus a margin of characteristic

00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:50.656 A:middle
25 centimeters to threshold the

00:29:50.656 --> 00:29:52.306 A:middle
depth map and create a binary

00:29:52.306 --> 00:29:54.076 A:middle
mask, foreground is one,

00:29:54.476 --> 00:29:55.296 A:middle
background is zero.

00:29:56.556 --> 00:29:58.456 A:middle
In fact, we can stop here, we

00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
can use this binary mask and
