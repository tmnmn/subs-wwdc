00:16:01.716 --> 00:16:04.636 A:middle
So now you see me and now you

00:16:04.636 --> 00:16:04.906 A:middle
don't.

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:09.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:09.766 --> 00:16:11.666 A:middle
So how do you add the stream

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.896 A:middle
from the TrueDepth camera into

00:16:12.896 --> 00:16:13.986 A:middle
your application?

00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:15.906 A:middle
Well I'm glad you asked.

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:17.526 A:middle
The first thing you need to do

00:16:17.986 --> 00:16:19.346 A:middle
is to discover the built-in

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:22.146 A:middle
TrueDepth camera and then you

00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.866 A:middle
initialize the device capture

00:16:23.866 --> 00:16:24.186 A:middle
input.

00:16:24.186 --> 00:16:27.416 A:middle
And you add the depth data

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:28.766 A:middle
output into your session.

00:16:29.606 --> 00:16:31.426 A:middle
At this point you're good to go,

00:16:31.496 --> 00:16:32.826 A:middle
you can start the session and

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:33.706 A:middle
you will have the TrueDepth

00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:35.266 A:middle
stream with your session.

00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:39.286 A:middle
This stream can come in two

00:16:39.286 --> 00:16:41.836 A:middle
forms of data, disparity or

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:42.166 A:middle
depth.

00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:44.306 A:middle
Now disparity is the inverse of

00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:46.586 A:middle
depth and vice versa, so which

00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:47.396 A:middle
one should you choose?

00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:51.366 A:middle
Well disparity usually yields

00:16:51.366 --> 00:16:53.456 A:middle
better results, especially for

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:54.596 A:middle
machine learning applications

00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:56.646 A:middle
but the depth data has more

00:16:56.646 --> 00:16:58.346 A:middle
meaning in terms of real-world

00:16:58.346 --> 00:16:58.926 A:middle
measurements.
