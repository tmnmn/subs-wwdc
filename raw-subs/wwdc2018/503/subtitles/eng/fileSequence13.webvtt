00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
I'm not even going to try to

00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:02.976 A:middle
explain what it does, let's just

00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:04.476 A:middle
take a look at the filter in

00:13:04.476 --> 00:13:04.816 A:middle
action.

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:12.516 A:middle
There you go, fun stuff and just

00:13:12.516 --> 00:13:14.236 A:middle
because we can do it I can

00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:15.696 A:middle
expose how many of these I want

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:16.406 A:middle
to stitch together.

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.726 A:middle
So going from just a few to you

00:13:18.726 --> 00:13:19.926 A:middle
really, really pushing that way,

00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
way too far.

00:13:21.966 --> 00:13:23.046 A:middle
Really exciting stuff.

00:13:23.456 --> 00:13:23.926 A:middle
All right.

00:13:29.046 --> 00:13:31.506 A:middle
So that's it for this demo, I

00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:32.356 A:middle
hope you enjoyed this.

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:35.606 A:middle
So if you'd like to know more

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:36.956 A:middle
about using Python bindings for

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.126 A:middle
Core Image I encourage you to

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:39.426 A:middle
come to this afternoon's session

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:40.906 A:middle
on Core Image Performance

00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:42.066 A:middle
Prototyping in Python.

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:45.616 A:middle
That's all for me today, let me

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.736 A:middle
introduce you to my colleague

00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:48.266 A:middle
Ron from video engineering who

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.676 A:middle
will be talking about real-time

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:51.046 A:middle
video effects with TrueDepth.

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:51.976 A:middle
Thank you everybody.

00:13:52.516 --> 00:13:56.500 A:middle

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:00.046 A:middle
