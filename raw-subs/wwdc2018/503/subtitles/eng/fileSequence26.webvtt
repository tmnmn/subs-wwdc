00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
transform it into a point cloud

00:26:00.876 --> 00:26:03.046 A:middle
and re-project it to the

00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:06.306 A:middle
perspective of the RGB image so

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:07.756 A:middle
the depth stream is already

00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:10.076 A:middle
registered on the video stream

00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:13.556 A:middle
for you and you get RGBD data.

00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:15.916 A:middle
Now, thank you.

00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:18.346 A:middle
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.526 A:middle
Now these types of operations

00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:23.456 A:middle
are best done in metal graphic

00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:23.906 A:middle
shaders.

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:25.476 A:middle
And you can download the code

00:26:25.476 --> 00:26:27.066 A:middle
for TrueDepth Streamer and you

00:26:27.066 --> 00:26:28.666 A:middle
want to focus on two areas.

00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:32.286 A:middle
In the vertex shader we control

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:33.296 A:middle
the location of the points,

00:26:33.486 --> 00:26:34.976 A:middle
we'll start with the depth map

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.696 A:middle
and transform it to real-world

00:26:36.696 --> 00:26:37.986 A:middle
coordinates or X, Y, Z.

00:26:39.186 --> 00:26:40.796 A:middle
Then we can multiply it with a

00:26:40.796 --> 00:26:43.006 A:middle
view matrix to change the point

00:26:43.006 --> 00:26:43.706 A:middle
of view to the scene.

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:49.066 A:middle
In the fragment shader we get

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.766 A:middle
the output of the vertex, but we

00:26:51.766 --> 00:26:53.866 A:middle
have to see if it's a real value

00:26:54.096 --> 00:26:55.186 A:middle
or a hole in the depth map.

00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:57.476 A:middle
If it's a hole and it's marked

00:26:57.476 --> 00:26:59.766 A:middle
as zero we don't know its depth

00:26:59.766 --> 00:27:01.516 A:middle
so we cannot transform it to X,
