00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:01.666 A:middle
great many effects, here is just

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.556 A:middle
one of them where we essentially

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.916 A:middle
do a foreground and background

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.306 A:middle
separation by darkening the

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:06.866 A:middle
background.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.466 A:middle
But we're really putting this

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.806 A:middle
tool into your hands so that you

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:12.256 A:middle
can create amazing apps and new

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.836 A:middle
effects and delight your users.

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.466 A:middle
All right, so the portrait

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.116 A:middle
effects matte is coming to you

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:21.326 A:middle
with iOS 12.

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:25.536 A:middle
It is available for both the

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.046 A:middle
front and the rear facing

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:27.476 A:middle
camera.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:31.516 A:middle
It is available to you with

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:33.726 A:middle
portrait still images and at the

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:34.766 A:middle
moment only when there are

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:35.616 A:middle
people in the scene.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.426 A:middle
Note that the portrait matte is

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.086 A:middle
linearly encoded, so it's not

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:42.306 A:middle
gamma encoded and what you get

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:43.346 A:middle
is a grayscale buffer.

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:46.966 A:middle
And also there's no guarantee

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:47.826 A:middle
that you will be getting a

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.036 A:middle
portrait matte alongside your

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.076 A:middle
portrait still images, you

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:51.516 A:middle
always do get the depth data but

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.316 A:middle
you need to make sure to test

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:54.196 A:middle
for its existence.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.176 A:middle
All right, let's take a look at

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.666 A:middle
the API and how we can actually

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
load that data in.
