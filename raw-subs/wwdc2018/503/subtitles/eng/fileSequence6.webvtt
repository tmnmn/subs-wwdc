00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
What this means that in your

00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:02.076 A:middle
applications you need to make

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:04.236 A:middle
sure to either down-sample your

00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:06.076 A:middle
RGB image to the size of your

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:08.636 A:middle
portrait depth or portrait matte

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.086 A:middle
or [inaudible] and sample them

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:12.496 A:middle
to the size of your RGB image.

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.316 A:middle
So that's all I wanted to talk

00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:16.286 A:middle
about today for the portrait

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:18.686 A:middle
segmentation API and we have a

00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:20.626 A:middle
great demo for you to see this

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.226 A:middle
live in action.

00:06:22.056 --> 00:06:24.986 A:middle
So during this demo I'll be

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:26.376 A:middle
making use of a Jupyter Notebook

00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:28.276 A:middle
which is a browser-based,

00:06:28.426 --> 00:06:30.816 A:middle
real-time interpreter for

00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:32.436 A:middle
Python.

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:34.826 A:middle
And we'll be making use of

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:36.456 A:middle
Python bindings for Core Image

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:37.646 A:middle
which we'll be introducing later

00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:38.976 A:middle
today in a separate session.

00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:46.626 A:middle
So let's start and load an image

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:48.686 A:middle
that contains portrait depth and

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:49.706 A:middle
portrait matte in.

00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:50.906 A:middle
So this is the image we're going

00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:51.516 A:middle
to be working with.

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:54.956 A:middle
The first thing I want to show

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.796 A:middle
you is what the depth data looks

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:57.906 A:middle
like for that image, so let's

00:06:57.906 --> 00:06:59.196 A:middle
look at the two side-by-side.

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:00.436 A:middle
So we have the portrait depth on
