00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.126 A:middle
load that data in.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:02.876 A:middle
So ImageIO provides a low-level

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:04.286 A:middle
API that allows you to load

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.466 A:middle
portrait effects matte.

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.456 A:middle
So by calling CGImageSourceCopy

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:10.426 A:middle
there's a new key it can pass

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.576 A:middle
kCGImageAuxiliaryData

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:13.806 A:middle
TypePortraitEffectsMatte.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:16.046 A:middle
And this call returns a

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:17.206 A:middle
dictionary containing three main

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:18.216 A:middle
pieces of information.

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:20.426 A:middle
The image data itself as a

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:24.176 A:middle
CFDataRef, metadata pertaining

00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:25.496 A:middle
to the buffer itself as a

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.096 A:middle
CFDictionary, as well as

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:30.236 A:middle
metadata pertaining to the

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:31.146 A:middle
capture itself.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.056 A:middle
AVFoundation also provides a

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:36.386 A:middle
higher-level API that sits on

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:38.186 A:middle
top of ImageIO that you can use.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.176 A:middle
So taking the output from

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:42.286 A:middle
CGImageSourceCopy you can feed

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
it to the AVPortrait effects

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:43.976 A:middle
matte class.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:49.656 A:middle
And what you get out of it is

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.326 A:middle
very simple it's a CV pixel

00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:53.596 A:middle
buffer along with pixel format

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:54.946 A:middle
type so you can use that CV

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:56.626 A:middle
pixel buffer for your further

00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:58.586 A:middle
processing needs, it's really

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
that simple.
