Some materials are specular or

00:21:01.036 --> 00:21:02.826 A:middle
shiny and they are very picky

00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:04.166 A:middle
and choosy in which direction

00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:05.046 A:middle
they send back the light.

00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:08.406 A:middle
An extreme scenario would be

00:21:08.406 --> 00:21:11.816 A:middle
this display, you can watch the

00:21:11.816 --> 00:21:12.846 A:middle
video stream to see the

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:13.436 A:middle
reflection.

00:21:14.616 --> 00:21:15.746 A:middle
And when we switch to the depth

00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:18.366 A:middle
map holes are forming depending

00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:19.746 A:middle
on the angle between the device

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:20.246 A:middle
and the screen.

00:21:21.556 --> 00:21:23.376 A:middle
And if we switch to the filtered

00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:25.216 A:middle
stream those holes are filled

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:26.976 A:middle
but with less fidelity.

00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:32.916 A:middle
Another challenging scenario is

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:35.306 A:middle
outdoor, typically in an outdoor

00:21:35.306 --> 00:21:36.996 A:middle
scene the background is very far

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle
away so we don't expect to get

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:39.806 A:middle
any depth on the background.

00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:42.956 A:middle
Also, the sun acts as an

00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:44.396 A:middle
aggressor to the active

00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:44.906 A:middle
illumination.

00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:48.696 A:middle
To demonstrate that I went

00:21:48.696 --> 00:21:50.006 A:middle
outside on a very sunny

00:21:50.006 --> 00:21:51.556 A:middle
afternoon, positioned myself

00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:52.326 A:middle
against the sun.

00:21:53.216 --> 00:21:54.286 A:middle
And when we switch to the depth

00:21:54.286 --> 00:21:55.926 A:middle
map you can see there's no

00:21:55.926 --> 00:21:58.056 A:middle
depths on the background and we

00:21:58.056 --> 00:21:59.786 A:middle
get some holes around the

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.726 A:middle
frames, specifically in this
