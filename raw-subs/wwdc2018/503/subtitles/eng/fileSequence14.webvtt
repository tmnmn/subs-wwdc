&gt;&gt; Thank you Emmanuel.

00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:02.826 A:middle
Great photo effects but what

00:14:02.826 --> 00:14:03.456 A:middle
about video.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:06.926 A:middle
My name is Ron Sokolovsky and I

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:07.916 A:middle
am from video engineering.

00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:11.946 A:middle
In this part we are going to

00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:13.236 A:middle
leverage the TrueDepth's camera

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:15.576 A:middle
to create similar effects with

00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:17.636 A:middle
real-time video, like for

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:19.226 A:middle
example this background

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.426 A:middle
replacement app.

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:24.556 A:middle
In order to create such effects

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:26.486 A:middle
we are going to deep dive into

00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:27.776 A:middle
the stream coming from the

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:29.306 A:middle
TrueDepth camera, the

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:31.336 A:middle
characteristics, best practices,

00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:32.066 A:middle
and challenges.

00:14:32.636 --> 00:14:35.316 A:middle
We are also going to show you

00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:36.706 A:middle
how to work with point clouds, a

00:14:36.706 --> 00:14:38.286 A:middle
completely different way to

00:14:38.286 --> 00:14:40.006 A:middle
process and render rich depth

00:14:40.006 --> 00:14:40.546 A:middle
information.

00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:42.626 A:middle
And that background replacement

00:14:42.846 --> 00:14:44.116 A:middle
app we're calling it Backdrop

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:45.516 A:middle
and we'll show you how to make

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:46.756 A:middle
it step-by-step.

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:50.116 A:middle
But first things first, the

00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:51.446 A:middle
stream for the TrueDepth's

00:14:51.446 --> 00:14:53.396 A:middle
camera is made of frames, each

00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:55.326 A:middle
frame is a depth map, a 2-D

00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:57.186 A:middle
image in which each pixel

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:58.926 A:middle
contains the depth information

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.526 A:middle
or the distance to the scene in
