00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.576 A:middle
smooth, spatially and temporally

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:03.536 A:middle
and the holes are filled from

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:04.356 A:middle
the RGB image.

00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:07.256 A:middle
This is especially useful for

00:19:07.256 --> 00:19:08.616 A:middle
photography and segmentation

00:19:08.616 --> 00:19:10.206 A:middle
applications because you know

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:12.386 A:middle
every time you query a pixel you

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.216 A:middle
get the depth's value.

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:17.376 A:middle
In TrueDepth Streamer you can

00:19:17.376 --> 00:19:19.566 A:middle
switch to the filter stream and

00:19:19.566 --> 00:19:21.876 A:middle
see that it is smoother and the

00:19:21.876 --> 00:19:22.586 A:middle
holes are filled.

00:19:23.126 --> 00:19:27.526 A:middle
So this is great, but it is not

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:29.246 A:middle
applicable to 100% of the use

00:19:29.246 --> 00:19:29.636 A:middle
cases.

00:19:30.226 --> 00:19:31.676 A:middle
If you're working with point

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:34.606 A:middle
clouds or any type of real-world

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:36.256 A:middle
measurements you're better off

00:19:36.256 --> 00:19:38.366 A:middle
staying with the raw data which

00:19:38.366 --> 00:19:39.806 A:middle
holds the highest fidelity.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.726 A:middle
If you do you will have holes,

00:19:42.906 --> 00:19:44.496 A:middle
you will have pixels marked as

00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:46.866 A:middle
zero, it does not mean that they

00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:48.396 A:middle
are the distance of zero meters

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.356 A:middle
from the camera it just means we

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.296 A:middle
have no information about them.

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:54.946 A:middle
Therefore, you should watch out

00:19:55.116 --> 00:19:56.506 A:middle
for operations like averaging

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:57.606 A:middle
and downsampling because you

00:19:57.606 --> 00:19:59.386 A:middle
don't want to mix those real

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
values with those zeros.
