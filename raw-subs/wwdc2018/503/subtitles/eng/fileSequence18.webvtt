00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.306 A:middle
and gauge the system pressure

00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:04.006 A:middle
level which goes from nominal to

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:06.216 A:middle
fair, serious, critical, and

00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:07.056 A:middle
then shutdown.

00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:08.956 A:middle
And the responsibility is in

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:10.886 A:middle
your hands because the system

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.326 A:middle
will let you go all the way to

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:15.206 A:middle
shutdown but when it does it's

00:18:15.206 --> 00:18:17.326 A:middle
bye-bye every capture device.

00:18:17.726 --> 00:18:22.026 A:middle
Another thing you can do is to

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:24.006 A:middle
adopt a degradation scheme, if

00:18:24.006 --> 00:18:25.496 A:middle
the pressure level gets serious

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:27.206 A:middle
you can reduce the frame rate to

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:29.736 A:middle
15 frames per second or you can

00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:31.516 A:middle
choose a more elaborate scheme

00:18:31.896 --> 00:18:33.966 A:middle
with gentle degradation going

00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:37.356 A:middle
from 30, 24, 20 and 15 frames

00:18:37.356 --> 00:18:39.536 A:middle
per second anytime the pressure

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:39.976 A:middle
level increases.

00:18:43.836 --> 00:18:45.026 A:middle
So we have holes in the depth

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:46.406 A:middle
map what can we do about it?

00:18:47.686 --> 00:18:49.456 A:middle
Well, in fact you could get the

00:18:49.456 --> 00:18:51.496 A:middle
stream already filtered for you.

00:18:52.176 --> 00:18:53.936 A:middle
There is a parameter called

00:18:53.936 --> 00:18:55.546 A:middle
isFilteringEnabled and it's'

00:18:55.546 --> 00:18:57.676 A:middle
defaulted to true, which means

00:18:57.676 --> 00:18:59.236 A:middle
you get a filtered depth map

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.576 A:middle
smooth, spatially and temporally
