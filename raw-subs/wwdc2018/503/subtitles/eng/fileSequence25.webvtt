00:24:58.486 --> 00:25:00.076 A:middle
And we want to transform it to a

00:25:00.076 --> 00:25:01.586 A:middle
new coordinate system in 3-D

00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:03.486 A:middle
space, X, Y, Z.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.256 A:middle
Now we already have Z right,

00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:07.616 A:middle
that's the depth from the depth

00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:09.766 A:middle
map but we want to get X and Y.

00:25:10.416 --> 00:25:13.606 A:middle
For that we need to get the help

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:15.806 A:middle
from the Intrinsics Matrix which

00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:17.196 A:middle
holds information for the focal

00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:18.346 A:middle
lengths and principle point.

00:25:19.376 --> 00:25:21.686 A:middle
If for example I want to get X I

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:22.936 A:middle
need to start with the pixel

00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:24.506 A:middle
coordinate U, subtract the

00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:26.576 A:middle
principle point, multiply by the

00:25:26.576 --> 00:25:28.576 A:middle
depth, and divide by the focal

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:28.916 A:middle
lengths.

00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:30.416 A:middle
And naturally I have to do the

00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:31.256 A:middle
same thing for the other

00:25:31.256 --> 00:25:32.026 A:middle
dimension as well.

00:25:33.196 --> 00:25:36.976 A:middle
Now this Intrinsics Matrix is

00:25:36.976 --> 00:25:38.436 A:middle
accessible through the camera

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.126 A:middle
calibration data.

00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:43.656 A:middle
In fact, this operation is done

00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:46.676 A:middle
in every frame of the TrueDepth

00:25:46.676 --> 00:25:47.056 A:middle
stream.

00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:49.836 A:middle
The reason for that is that the

00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:51.656 A:middle
video stream and the depth

00:25:51.656 --> 00:25:53.076 A:middle
stream are coming from two

00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:54.506 A:middle
separate cameras.

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:57.246 A:middle
But because the TrueDepth camera

00:25:57.246 --> 00:25:58.936 A:middle
gives us a depth map we can

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
transform it into a point cloud
