00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:01.386 A:middle
blurring the mask so that we get

00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:03.006 A:middle
a nice feathered look.

00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:05.126 A:middle
Let's have a look at this in

00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:05.456 A:middle
action.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.456 A:middle
So remember all of this is

00:08:07.456 --> 00:08:09.966 A:middle
executed live in the browser

00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:11.396 A:middle
using Core Image as a back end.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.836 A:middle
All right so the first thing I

00:08:13.836 --> 00:08:15.356 A:middle
want to show you is how changing

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
percentile point changes my mask

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:17.036 A:middle
here.

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:19.216 A:middle
So the higher it is the less

00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:20.496 A:middle
aggressive I am on clipping the

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:21.026 A:middle
foreground.

00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:22.316 A:middle
So let's pick a value that's

00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:24.016 A:middle
reasonable, maybe something like

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:24.466 A:middle
this here.

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:26.556 A:middle
And what you can see here is

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.246 A:middle
that there are regions or

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:29.376 A:middle
islands we call them that are

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:31.226 A:middle
connected to my foreground and

00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:32.176 A:middle
there's a bit of the subject

00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:33.086 A:middle
here I'd like to take out.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:35.086 A:middle
So what I'll do is I'll add a

00:08:35.086 --> 00:08:36.446 A:middle
bit of morphological closing.

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:38.385 A:middle
Look at how this appears

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:38.936 A:middle
magically.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:40.885 A:middle
If I go too far obviously I lose

00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:41.956 A:middle
my entire subjects, I don't want

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:42.265 A:middle
to do that.

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:43.866 A:middle
So let's pick something like

00:08:43.866 --> 00:08:44.226 A:middle
this.

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:46.576 A:middle
What I can do then is change the

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:47.876 A:middle
feathering by applying the mask

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:48.556 A:middle
on top of it all.

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:50.306 A:middle
Let's take a look at how the RGB

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:51.266 A:middle
is threshold in back.

00:08:51.686 --> 00:08:52.906 A:middle
This is not the effect we're

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:54.176 A:middle
coming up it's just to give a

00:08:54.176 --> 00:08:55.166 A:middle
sense of how the mask is

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:56.306 A:middle
applied, so let's keep going.

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:59.206 A:middle
So I've chosen a few parameters

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.746 A:middle
for this thresholding here and
