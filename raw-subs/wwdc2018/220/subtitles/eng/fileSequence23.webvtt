00:22:58.016 --> 00:23:00.266 A:middle
very fast one step update of

00:23:00.266 --> 00:23:02.426 A:middle
just exactly what has to change

00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:03.756 A:middle
due to this one constraint

00:23:03.756 --> 00:23:04.106 A:middle
changing.

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:05.896 A:middle
So that's a performance

00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:06.606 A:middle
optimization.

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:07.936 A:middle
That's why we even have this

00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:08.936 A:middle
method set constant.

00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:11.526 A:middle
Last to talk about it priority.

00:23:12.436 --> 00:23:14.536 A:middle
So here you can say, you know,

00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:16.266 A:middle
you can say this view should

00:23:16.266 --> 00:23:18.676 A:middle
ideally be 100 points wide, but

00:23:18.876 --> 00:23:20.046 A:middle
if something else prevents that

00:23:20.046 --> 00:23:21.766 A:middle
just please be as close as

00:23:21.766 --> 00:23:22.236 A:middle
possible.

00:23:22.956 --> 00:23:24.636 A:middle
This does incur some more work,

00:23:25.326 --> 00:23:26.196 A:middle
some amount of work.

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.666 A:middle
So let's talk about that a

00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:28.306 A:middle
little bit more.

00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:29.866 A:middle
Another way to think about that

00:23:30.206 --> 00:23:31.626 A:middle
is to say that the width of that

00:23:31.626 --> 00:23:32.936 A:middle
field is going to be equal to

00:23:32.936 --> 00:23:35.666 A:middle
100 plus some error and please

00:23:35.666 --> 00:23:36.716 A:middle
minimize the error.

00:23:37.436 --> 00:23:38.496 A:middle
That's what you're asking for.

00:23:39.776 --> 00:23:41.266 A:middle
So there is an error

00:23:41.266 --> 00:23:42.536 A:middle
minimization phase I didn't

00:23:42.536 --> 00:23:43.156 A:middle
discuss before.

00:23:43.366 --> 00:23:46.816 A:middle
So when the view asks the engine

00:23:46.816 --> 00:23:48.086 A:middle
as part of layout subviews and

00:23:48.086 --> 00:23:49.896 A:middle
says, hey what's the value for

00:23:49.896 --> 00:23:50.446 A:middle
these variables?

00:23:50.686 --> 00:23:51.866 A:middle
The engine needs to make sure

00:23:51.866 --> 00:23:53.366 A:middle
that all of those error terms

00:23:53.366 --> 00:23:54.626 A:middle
have been minimized first.

00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:57.476 A:middle
And this is actually, this is --

00:23:57.476 --> 00:23:58.546 A:middle
I'm not going to go into how

00:23:58.546 --> 00:23:59.976 A:middle
this works but I am going to

00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:00.726 A:middle
talk a little bit about
