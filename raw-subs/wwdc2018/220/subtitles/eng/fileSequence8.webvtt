00:08:00.506 --> 00:08:01.536 A:middle
all the intermediate ones are

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:02.856 A:middle
wasted, you really just want to

00:08:02.856 --> 00:08:03.516 A:middle
measure at the end.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:04.896 A:middle
And that's what the Render Loop

00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:05.316 A:middle
gives you.

00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:07.656 A:middle
Because what you can do instead

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.066 A:middle
is that inside a set font you

00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:10.646 A:middle
can just call

00:08:10.646 --> 00:08:13.206 A:middle
setNeedsUpdateConstraints and

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:14.986 A:middle
then you're guaranteed to get

00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:17.366 A:middle
update constraints at the end

00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:18.466 A:middle
before the frame goes to the

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:18.826 A:middle
screen.

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:20.456 A:middle
And that's what it's for.

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.876 A:middle
So the couple things to

00:08:22.876 --> 00:08:24.386 A:middle
understand from this before we

00:08:24.386 --> 00:08:26.176 A:middle
move on is number one it runs a

00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:27.626 A:middle
lot, 120 frames a second.

00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:30.346 A:middle
Number two they're parallel.

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:31.906 A:middle
So you can use that for

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:32.696 A:middle
intuition as well.

00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:33.866 A:middle
If you feel like you understand

00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:35.035 A:middle
the layout pass or have some

00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:36.956 A:middle
feel for that, same deal when

00:08:36.956 --> 00:08:37.506 A:middle
you're thinking about

00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:38.525 A:middle
UpdateConstraints or you're

00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:39.256 A:middle
thinking about display.

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:41.746 A:middle
And then the last thing being

00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:43.756 A:middle
that the whole reason it's there

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.886 A:middle
is to avoid wasted work, to

00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:47.656 A:middle
defer work and possibly skip it

00:08:47.656 --> 00:08:48.036 A:middle
entirely.

00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:53.316 A:middle
All right, so having looked at

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:54.876 A:middle
that we are now in position to

00:08:54.876 --> 00:08:56.156 A:middle
analyze the rest of this method.

00:08:56.896 --> 00:08:59.476 A:middle
See how we are -- every time

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:01.076 A:middle
it's called we're deactivating
