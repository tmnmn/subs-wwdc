00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:00.726 A:middle
talk a little bit about

00:24:00.726 --> 00:24:02.006 A:middle
performance characteristics and

00:24:02.056 --> 00:24:02.996 A:middle
I'm also going to say that's

00:24:02.996 --> 00:24:03.586 A:middle
super neat.

00:24:04.536 --> 00:24:06.746 A:middle
So you might want to look this

00:24:06.746 --> 00:24:07.196 A:middle
up.

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.476 A:middle
This is the simple X algorithm.

00:24:08.476 --> 00:24:09.526 A:middle
This is what we're really doing.

00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.206 A:middle
It's super old.

00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:12.666 A:middle
It was developed during World

00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:13.186 A:middle
War II.

00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:16.606 A:middle
What you might note is before

00:24:16.806 --> 00:24:17.246 A:middle
computers.

00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:19.026 A:middle
In fact, the people who used to

00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:20.356 A:middle
be called computers, before

00:24:20.356 --> 00:24:21.156 A:middle
there were machines that were

00:24:21.156 --> 00:24:22.416 A:middle
called computers, this is kind

00:24:22.416 --> 00:24:23.016 A:middle
of what they're doing.

00:24:23.486 --> 00:24:25.706 A:middle
They're doing it by hand, which

00:24:25.856 --> 00:24:27.146 A:middle
does give you some feel for the

00:24:27.146 --> 00:24:28.076 A:middle
performance characteristics.

00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:29.566 A:middle
It must be pretty fast if you do

00:24:29.566 --> 00:24:30.096 A:middle
it by hand.

00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:30.816 A:middle
And it is.

00:24:31.126 --> 00:24:33.336 A:middle
It's pretty much the same stuff

00:24:33.336 --> 00:24:34.106 A:middle
we've been doing.

00:24:34.166 --> 00:24:35.326 A:middle
It's more substitutions.

00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:36.966 A:middle
That's how you should think of

00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:37.066 A:middle
it.

00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:39.676 A:middle
Anyway, but it does -- you know,

00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:40.986 A:middle
when you use priority it does

00:24:40.986 --> 00:24:42.116 A:middle
cost at this level so that's

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:43.146 A:middle
just something to be aware of.

00:24:44.226 --> 00:24:45.526 A:middle
OK, and other than that it's

00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:46.216 A:middle
just same as before.

00:24:46.616 --> 00:24:50.276 A:middle
So that's what I wanted to talk

00:24:50.276 --> 00:24:50.546 A:middle
about.

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:52.556 A:middle
So that is our attempt to build

00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:54.836 A:middle
this intuitive understanding of

00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:56.086 A:middle
the performance characteristics

00:24:56.086 --> 00:24:58.046 A:middle
around Auto Layout.

00:24:58.176 --> 00:24:59.296 A:middle
So quick review of what we

00:24:59.296 --> 00:24:59.746 A:middle
talked about.
