00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:01.346 A:middle
And Mysteries of Auto Layout,

00:40:01.346 --> 00:40:02.756 A:middle
Part 2, had some good debugging

00:40:02.756 --> 00:40:04.566 A:middle
information so you might be

00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:05.706 A:middle
interested in checking that out

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:06.786 A:middle
if you have been having trouble

00:40:06.786 --> 00:40:07.676 A:middle
with your unsatisfiable

00:40:07.676 --> 00:40:08.236 A:middle
constraints.

00:40:09.806 --> 00:40:11.556 A:middle
OK, guys you've graduated.

00:40:11.556 --> 00:40:12.346 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:40:12.346 --> 00:40:13.946 A:middle
You are all Auto Layout experts

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:16.626 A:middle
and, you know, I hope that you

00:40:16.626 --> 00:40:17.856 A:middle
really enjoyed learning about

00:40:17.856 --> 00:40:19.236 A:middle
the internals of how it works.

00:40:19.866 --> 00:40:21.736 A:middle
Now you know better how to think

00:40:21.736 --> 00:40:23.056 A:middle
before you update constraints

00:40:23.256 --> 00:40:24.416 A:middle
and understand the process they

00:40:24.416 --> 00:40:25.826 A:middle
go through, you've got some

00:40:25.826 --> 00:40:27.916 A:middle
tuning information with size and

00:40:27.916 --> 00:40:29.846 A:middle
priority and inequality, and you

00:40:29.846 --> 00:40:32.056 A:middle
have faster layouts in iOS 12 so

00:40:32.056 --> 00:40:32.726 A:middle
that's awesome.

00:40:33.416 --> 00:40:34.426 A:middle
We're going to be in the Labs

00:40:34.496 --> 00:40:35.886 A:middle
tomorrow if anybody has

00:40:35.926 --> 00:40:36.386 A:middle
questions.

00:40:37.006 --> 00:40:38.406 A:middle
And we've got the link here for

00:40:38.406 --> 00:40:39.696 A:middle
information in related sessions.

00:40:40.286 --> 00:40:40.976 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of your week.

00:40:41.516 --> 00:40:45.500 A:middle
