00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
All right, so that was

00:35:00.096 --> 00:35:01.026 A:middle
constraint churn in the

00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:01.546 A:middle
instrument.

00:35:01.626 --> 00:35:02.596 A:middle
We also have that view at the

00:35:02.596 --> 00:35:04.326 A:middle
bottom that said UILabel sizing.

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:07.186 A:middle
UILabel sizing is tracking the

00:35:07.186 --> 00:35:08.246 A:middle
amount of time it takes for the

00:35:08.246 --> 00:35:09.926 A:middle
label to calculate its size.

00:35:10.226 --> 00:35:11.566 A:middle
So let's talk about intrinsic

00:35:11.566 --> 00:35:12.236 A:middle
content size.

00:35:12.566 --> 00:35:14.796 A:middle
I'm going to take a walk over

00:35:14.796 --> 00:35:15.036 A:middle
here.

00:35:15.886 --> 00:35:17.546 A:middle
OK, not all views actually need

00:35:17.896 --> 00:35:19.096 A:middle
intrinsic content size.

00:35:20.716 --> 00:35:21.426 A:middle
Some views do.

00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:24.076 A:middle
Views with non-view content like

00:35:24.076 --> 00:35:25.276 A:middle
to return a size for their

00:35:25.276 --> 00:35:26.936 A:middle
intrinsic content size based on

00:35:26.936 --> 00:35:28.086 A:middle
that non-view content.

00:35:28.486 --> 00:35:30.126 A:middle
Two examples of this are

00:35:30.126 --> 00:35:32.156 A:middle
UIImageView, which uses the size

00:35:32.156 --> 00:35:33.826 A:middle
of its image to calculate its

00:35:33.826 --> 00:35:36.036 A:middle
intrinsic content size and

00:35:36.036 --> 00:35:38.116 A:middle
UILabel, which measures its text

00:35:38.576 --> 00:35:39.976 A:middle
and uses that to return its

00:35:39.976 --> 00:35:41.056 A:middle
intrinsic content size.

00:35:41.636 --> 00:35:43.666 A:middle
There's nothing really magical

00:35:43.666 --> 00:35:45.076 A:middle
about intrinsic content size,

00:35:45.486 --> 00:35:47.286 A:middle
it's used to create constraints

00:35:47.286 --> 00:35:47.856 A:middle
by UIView.

00:35:48.486 --> 00:35:49.886 A:middle
It makes sizing constraints for

00:35:49.886 --> 00:35:50.886 A:middle
you and that's it.

00:35:51.596 --> 00:35:52.476 A:middle
You can define all of your

00:35:52.476 --> 00:35:54.106 A:middle
sizing in constraints yourself

00:35:54.576 --> 00:35:55.576 A:middle
and skip this whole thing.

00:35:56.436 --> 00:35:57.496 A:middle
There are a few circumstances

00:35:57.496 --> 00:35:58.646 A:middle
where it needs to be overridden,

00:35:58.646 --> 00:36:00.026 A:middle
that's what it's there, as we
