&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.956 A:middle
Welcome. My name is Ken Ferry.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:30.736 A:middle
Today Kasia Wawer and I are

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:31.536 A:middle
going to talk to you about

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:32.686 A:middle
performance in Auto Layout.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.466 A:middle
Last time I was up here talking

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.446 A:middle
about Auto Layout was in 2011

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.356 A:middle
when we first introduced it.

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:42.216 A:middle
So it's really great to be back

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:43.206 A:middle
up here chatting with you all

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:43.446 A:middle
today.

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:48.896 A:middle
OK, so Auto Layout.

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:51.366 A:middle
This is how we position content

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:52.916 A:middle
on iOS on the Mac.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.096 A:middle
The main object involved as we

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.456 A:middle
know are views and constraints,

00:00:58.246 --> 00:00:59.096 A:middle
constraints giving the

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:00.406 A:middle
relationships between views.
