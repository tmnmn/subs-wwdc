00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:00.296 A:middle
and last we're calling

00:06:00.296 --> 00:06:02.356 A:middle
super.updateConstraints was an

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:04.256 A:middle
important thing to do because

00:06:04.586 --> 00:06:06.556 A:middle
the UIView level implementation

00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:08.976 A:middle
that this method does do work.

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:10.966 A:middle
OK, that's the basic structure

00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:14.256 A:middle
of what it's doing and it does

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:15.306 A:middle
work, it's functions.

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:18.676 A:middle
But let's talk about what it's

00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:20.136 A:middle
doing more concretely now so

00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:20.806 A:middle
that we can understand the

00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
performance.

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:23.116 A:middle
So the first thing to understand

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.736 A:middle
is what exactly is

00:06:24.856 --> 00:06:26.336 A:middle
updateConstraints, this method

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:26.906 A:middle
we're overriding.

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:30.166 A:middle
Well, it's one component of the

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:30.646 A:middle
Render Loop.

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:33.266 A:middle
The Render Loop is the process

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:35.446 A:middle
that runs potentially at 120

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:36.476 A:middle
times every second.

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:38.976 A:middle
That makes sure that all the

00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:40.346 A:middle
content is ready to go for each

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:40.656 A:middle
frame.

00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:43.786 A:middle
OK, so it consists of three

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.066 A:middle
phases -- Update Constraints,

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.386 A:middle
Layout, and Display.

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:49.246 A:middle
First every view that needs it

00:06:49.246 --> 00:06:50.916 A:middle
will receive updateConstraints.

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:53.306 A:middle
And that runs from the leaf most

00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:55.096 A:middle
views up to the view hierarchy

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:55.786 A:middle
towards the window.

00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:58.676 A:middle
Next, every view receives layout

00:06:58.676 --> 00:06:59.086 A:middle
sub views.

00:06:59.366 --> 00:07:00.616 A:middle
This runs the opposite direction
