00:25:59.946 --> 00:26:01.286 A:middle
about and putting that intuition

00:26:01.286 --> 00:26:02.006 A:middle
into practice.

00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:03.926 A:middle
So please enjoy.

00:26:04.516 --> 00:26:11.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:12.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ok let me get to my slide

00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:13.096 A:middle
here.

00:26:14.056 --> 00:26:14.586 A:middle
Thank you, Ken.

00:26:14.946 --> 00:26:15.696 A:middle
Hi everybody.

00:26:15.956 --> 00:26:17.246 A:middle
My name is Kasia Wawer.

00:26:17.796 --> 00:26:18.896 A:middle
I am a member of the iOS

00:26:18.896 --> 00:26:20.886 A:middle
Keyboards Team and we use Auto

00:26:20.886 --> 00:26:22.106 A:middle
Layout and we love it.

00:26:22.646 --> 00:26:24.006 A:middle
So I get to talk to all of you

00:26:24.006 --> 00:26:24.916 A:middle
about building efficient

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:25.206 A:middle
layouts.

00:26:26.286 --> 00:26:27.056 A:middle
All right, let's go back to

00:26:27.056 --> 00:26:28.376 A:middle
Constraint Churn real quick

00:26:28.376 --> 00:26:28.586 A:middle
here.

00:26:29.116 --> 00:26:30.396 A:middle
Constraint churn as we heard

00:26:30.396 --> 00:26:31.876 A:middle
happens when you change your

00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:33.726 A:middle
constraints but the actual views

00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:35.396 A:middle
don't need to move so you're

00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:36.816 A:middle
sending extra work to the engine

00:26:37.276 --> 00:26:38.456 A:middle
and enough of that can affect

00:26:38.456 --> 00:26:39.106 A:middle
your performance.

00:26:39.106 --> 00:26:40.776 A:middle
So you tend to want to avoid it.

00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:43.646 A:middle
So let's talk about how you

00:26:43.646 --> 00:26:45.746 A:middle
might run into this problem and

00:26:45.746 --> 00:26:46.556 A:middle
how you might get out of it.

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.386 A:middle
So we're going to work with a

00:26:48.386 --> 00:26:49.056 A:middle
spec here.

00:26:49.286 --> 00:26:50.586 A:middle
This is for a social media type

00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:50.866 A:middle
app.

00:26:51.586 --> 00:26:52.526 A:middle
There's an avatar view that

00:26:52.526 --> 00:26:53.566 A:middle
shows you who is sharing.

00:26:53.566 --> 00:26:56.336 A:middle
There's a title, a date, and a

00:26:56.336 --> 00:26:59.206 A:middle
log entry view and for that

00:26:59.206 --> 00:27:00.186 A:middle
you're going to need some
