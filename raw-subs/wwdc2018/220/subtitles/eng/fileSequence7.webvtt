00:06:59.366 --> 00:07:00.616 A:middle
This runs the opposite direction

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:01.686 A:middle
starting from the window going

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:02.516 A:middle
down towards the leaves.

00:07:03.176 --> 00:07:05.886 A:middle
Last, every view gets draw if it

00:07:05.886 --> 00:07:07.856 A:middle
needs it, that kind of thing.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.166 A:middle
OK, what are these for?

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.156 A:middle
Why do they exist?

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:14.736 A:middle
Well, they all have the exact

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:17.016 A:middle
same purpose and they have exact

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:18.226 A:middle
parallel sets of methods.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.586 A:middle
And that purpose is to avoid

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:23.416 A:middle
wasted work, which I can explain

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:23.966 A:middle
by example.

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:28.516 A:middle
So a label, a UI label needs to

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:30.346 A:middle
have constraints that describe

00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:33.466 A:middle
the size of its text, OK?

00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:34.986 A:middle
But there are many properties

00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:36.126 A:middle
that contribute to that size.

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:37.426 A:middle
There's the text property

00:07:37.426 --> 00:07:39.936 A:middle
itself, there's the font, and

00:07:39.936 --> 00:07:41.356 A:middle
the text size, etcetera.

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.196 A:middle
One way to do this would be that

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:44.946 A:middle
every time one of those

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:47.076 A:middle
properties changes go re-measure

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:47.576 A:middle
your text.

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:51.006 A:middle
However, that would often be

00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:52.096 A:middle
pretty inefficient because you

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:53.206 A:middle
usually change a bunch of these

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:53.766 A:middle
right in a row.

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:55.076 A:middle
When you're first setting up a

00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:56.176 A:middle
label, you're probably going to

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.306 A:middle
call a bunch of these property

00:07:57.306 --> 00:07:58.506 A:middle
setters and if you're

00:07:58.506 --> 00:07:59.976 A:middle
re-measuring text on each one,
