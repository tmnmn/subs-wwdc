00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:00.846 A:middle
text inside of it.

00:37:00.946 --> 00:37:02.306 A:middle
For instance, the constraints

00:37:02.306 --> 00:37:03.156 A:middle
are always going to make it

00:37:03.156 --> 00:37:04.316 A:middle
larger than the amount of text

00:37:04.316 --> 00:37:04.706 A:middle
you have.

00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:06.586 A:middle
Then you can go ahead and return

00:37:06.586 --> 00:37:07.996 A:middle
no intrinsic metric for the

00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:09.716 A:middle
width and height in intrinsic

00:37:09.716 --> 00:37:10.446 A:middle
content size.

00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:12.206 A:middle
And what this will do is tell

00:37:12.206 --> 00:37:13.486 A:middle
the parent, hey I already have

00:37:13.486 --> 00:37:15.206 A:middle
my size, don't bother to do the

00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:15.846 A:middle
text measurement.

00:37:16.826 --> 00:37:18.226 A:middle
So obviously this only works if

00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:19.096 A:middle
you're not trying to detect

00:37:19.096 --> 00:37:21.826 A:middle
measurement yourself, but it can

00:37:21.826 --> 00:37:23.136 A:middle
help some apps improve their

00:37:23.136 --> 00:37:23.646 A:middle
performance.

00:37:23.646 --> 00:37:24.886 A:middle
So I wanted you to know that

00:37:24.886 --> 00:37:26.016 A:middle
this little trick exists.

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:27.766 A:middle
And we can't talk about

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:29.116 A:middle
intrinsic content size without

00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:30.566 A:middle
talking about system layout size

00:37:30.566 --> 00:37:33.326 A:middle
fitting size because people

00:37:33.326 --> 00:37:35.666 A:middle
often conflate the two even

00:37:35.666 --> 00:37:36.196 A:middle
though they're kind of

00:37:36.196 --> 00:37:37.846 A:middle
opposites, so that's kind of

00:37:37.846 --> 00:37:39.376 A:middle
unfortunate.

00:37:39.376 --> 00:37:41.456 A:middle
Intrinsic content size is a way

00:37:41.456 --> 00:37:42.446 A:middle
that you communicate size

00:37:42.446 --> 00:37:43.866 A:middle
information to be put into the

00:37:43.866 --> 00:37:44.226 A:middle
engine.

00:37:45.206 --> 00:37:46.796 A:middle
System Layout Size Fitting Size

00:37:47.156 --> 00:37:48.206 A:middle
is a way that you get sizing

00:37:48.206 --> 00:37:49.456 A:middle
information back out of the

00:37:49.456 --> 00:37:49.826 A:middle
engine.

00:37:50.356 --> 00:37:51.276 A:middle
They're actually kind of

00:37:51.816 --> 00:37:52.486 A:middle
opposites.

00:37:52.486 --> 00:37:54.696 A:middle
So this is used in sort of mixed

00:37:54.696 --> 00:37:56.086 A:middle
layouts where there's some

00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:57.136 A:middle
reason that you need frame

00:37:57.136 --> 00:37:58.816 A:middle
information from a view that

00:37:58.816 --> 00:38:00.236 A:middle
manages its subviews using Auto
