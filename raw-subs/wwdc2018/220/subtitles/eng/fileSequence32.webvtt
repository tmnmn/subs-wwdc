00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:00.346 A:middle
log entry label being able to

00:32:00.346 --> 00:32:00.806 A:middle
get longer.

00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:02.726 A:middle
So those green constraints

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.866 A:middle
should be added when you create

00:32:04.866 --> 00:32:07.806 A:middle
the views and then left in

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:08.206 A:middle
place.

00:32:08.566 --> 00:32:09.046 A:middle
Don't touch them.

00:32:09.276 --> 00:32:10.236 A:middle
They want to stay where they

00:32:10.236 --> 00:32:10.446 A:middle
are.

00:32:12.026 --> 00:32:13.646 A:middle
But now we have the four

00:32:13.646 --> 00:32:15.076 A:middle
constraints that are controlling

00:32:15.076 --> 00:32:15.586 A:middle
the image view.

00:32:15.846 --> 00:32:16.926 A:middle
So what do we do with those?

00:32:17.216 --> 00:32:17.916 A:middle
Well, let's stick them in an

00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:21.366 A:middle
array and let's also take the

00:32:21.366 --> 00:32:22.276 A:middle
constraints that are going to be

00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:23.746 A:middle
there when there's no image.

00:32:24.126 --> 00:32:25.246 A:middle
And I very creatively named

00:32:25.246 --> 00:32:26.416 A:middle
these imageConstraints and

00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:27.696 A:middle
noImageConstraints so you can

00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:28.526 A:middle
keep them apart.

00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:32.316 A:middle
And let's, when we're getting to

00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:33.456 A:middle
the point where we're going to

00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:34.526 A:middle
be putting in this image view or

00:32:34.526 --> 00:32:36.366 A:middle
taking it away, let's see what

00:32:36.366 --> 00:32:37.556 A:middle
layout we're currently in.

00:32:38.036 --> 00:32:38.666 A:middle
Deactivate the

00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.546 A:middle
noImageConstraints if we need to

00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:42.346 A:middle
and activate the ones for the

00:32:42.346 --> 00:32:42.776 A:middle
image.

00:32:43.786 --> 00:32:45.516 A:middle
If we don't have an image coming

00:32:45.516 --> 00:32:46.716 A:middle
in, you know, all of our other

00:32:46.716 --> 00:32:47.426 A:middle
constraints are already

00:32:47.426 --> 00:32:48.886 A:middle
activated, we just have the one

00:32:49.186 --> 00:32:49.846 A:middle
that we're adding.

00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:51.416 A:middle
Now I put these both in arrays

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:52.456 A:middle
despite the fact that this is a

00:32:52.456 --> 00:32:53.936 A:middle
single constraint because it

00:32:53.936 --> 00:32:55.226 A:middle
simplifies things in my code.

00:32:55.756 --> 00:32:56.676 A:middle
I don't need to check and see

00:32:56.676 --> 00:32:57.486 A:middle
whether I'm dealing with an

00:32:57.486 --> 00:32:58.846 A:middle
array or a single constraint,

00:32:59.206 --> 00:33:00.226 A:middle
I'm always dealing with an array
