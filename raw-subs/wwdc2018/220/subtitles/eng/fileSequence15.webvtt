00:14:58.386 --> 00:15:00.716 A:middle
So let's finish the process.

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:03.106 A:middle
What happens for the rest of the

00:15:03.106 --> 00:15:04.516 A:middle
process is that whenever the

00:15:04.516 --> 00:15:06.506 A:middle
engine sort of assigns a value

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:07.816 A:middle
to one of these variables, it's

00:15:07.816 --> 00:15:09.746 A:middle
going to inform the view that

00:15:09.746 --> 00:15:11.246 A:middle
the variable came from and say,

00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:12.036 A:middle
this thing changed.

00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:14.726 A:middle
What will the view do in

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:15.406 A:middle
response to that?

00:15:16.526 --> 00:15:17.556 A:middle
Well, if you think about it for

00:15:17.556 --> 00:15:19.646 A:middle
a minute it will call it

00:15:19.646 --> 00:15:20.956 A:middle
Superview and say hey,

00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:23.536 A:middle
setNeedsLayout because it needs

00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:23.816 A:middle
to move.

00:15:25.226 --> 00:15:27.196 A:middle
OK, that was all happening as

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:29.926 A:middle
part of the update constraints

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:30.216 A:middle
phase.

00:15:31.136 --> 00:15:32.106 A:middle
We now just receive

00:15:32.106 --> 00:15:33.716 A:middle
setNeedsLayout, so at some point

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.246 A:middle
it will move on to the layout

00:15:35.246 --> 00:15:35.536 A:middle
phase.

00:15:36.696 --> 00:15:39.846 A:middle
Then, OK, so the last piece of

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:40.846 A:middle
the puzzle is that we'll

00:15:40.846 --> 00:15:42.236 A:middle
receive, UIView will receive

00:15:42.236 --> 00:15:45.776 A:middle
layout Subviews will do is it

00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:47.816 A:middle
will copy that data from the

00:15:47.816 --> 00:15:49.096 A:middle
engine into the frame.

00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:52.356 A:middle
So it will just say engine, what

00:15:52.356 --> 00:15:53.546 A:middle
are the values for those

00:15:53.546 --> 00:15:53.956 A:middle
variables?

00:15:54.446 --> 00:15:56.676 A:middle
Engine will tell it and it will

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:58.746 A:middle
just call set Superview of that

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.216 A:middle
view we'll call setBounds at
