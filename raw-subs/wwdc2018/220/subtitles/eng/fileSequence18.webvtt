00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:00.746 A:middle
so it's just sort of a giant

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.026 A:middle
ball of mud and performance

00:18:03.026 --> 00:18:04.296 A:middle
probably sucks.

00:18:05.056 --> 00:18:07.306 A:middle
OK, but having looked at what

00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:08.936 A:middle
we've looked at, let's see what

00:18:08.936 --> 00:18:11.086 A:middle
happens in the common case where

00:18:11.086 --> 00:18:13.136 A:middle
you don't have this because most

00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:14.006 A:middle
of the time you don't.

00:18:14.506 --> 00:18:16.476 A:middle
Most of the time views are only

00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:17.906 A:middle
constrained to their parent and

00:18:17.906 --> 00:18:18.916 A:middle
to their siblings.

00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:22.056 A:middle
What you'll see there is that

00:18:22.056 --> 00:18:23.026 A:middle
since we have these two

00:18:23.026 --> 00:18:25.586 A:middle
independent blocks, that will

00:18:25.586 --> 00:18:27.036 A:middle
give, if you look inside the

00:18:27.036 --> 00:18:28.366 A:middle
engine it will be two

00:18:28.366 --> 00:18:29.926 A:middle
independent blocks of equations

00:18:29.926 --> 00:18:31.206 A:middle
that completely don't interact

00:18:31.206 --> 00:18:32.366 A:middle
with each other, that don't have

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:33.636 A:middle
any overlapping variables.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.776 A:middle
What that will do, is that

00:18:36.776 --> 00:18:38.186 A:middle
because they completely don' t

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:39.266 A:middle
overlap, they just don't

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:39.596 A:middle
interact.

00:18:39.996 --> 00:18:41.296 A:middle
And if we have one of these it

00:18:41.296 --> 00:18:43.586 A:middle
will take some amount of time to

00:18:43.586 --> 00:18:43.966 A:middle
deal with.

00:18:44.246 --> 00:18:45.536 A:middle
If we have two of them it will

00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:47.256 A:middle
just take twice the time because

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:48.206 A:middle
they have nothing to do with

00:18:48.206 --> 00:18:48.486 A:middle
each other.

00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:50.316 A:middle
Three of them, three times,

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.566 A:middle
etcetera, the point is you're

00:18:52.626 --> 00:18:54.366 A:middle
going to see a line.

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:56.836 A:middle
You're going to see linear

00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:58.026 A:middle
performance, which is the best

00:18:58.026 --> 00:18:59.016 A:middle
you can get.

00:18:59.276 --> 00:19:00.706 A:middle
That's perfect marks for this
