00:35:58.646 --> 00:36:00.026 A:middle
that's what it's there, as we

00:36:00.026 --> 00:36:01.156 A:middle
saw there are these couple of

00:36:01.156 --> 00:36:02.586 A:middle
things plus some other examples

00:36:02.586 --> 00:36:03.776 A:middle
in UIView subclasses.

00:36:04.346 --> 00:36:05.786 A:middle
But a lot of the times it gets

00:36:05.786 --> 00:36:07.026 A:middle
overridden because the

00:36:07.026 --> 00:36:07.986 A:middle
assumption that it's either

00:36:07.986 --> 00:36:10.136 A:middle
faster or more exact and it is

00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:10.946 A:middle
neither of those things.

00:36:12.076 --> 00:36:14.546 A:middle
However, there is a circumstance

00:36:14.546 --> 00:36:15.846 A:middle
where overriding it might help

00:36:15.846 --> 00:36:16.506 A:middle
your performance.

00:36:18.206 --> 00:36:19.406 A:middle
Text measurement can be

00:36:19.406 --> 00:36:19.926 A:middle
expensive.

00:36:21.186 --> 00:36:24.106 A:middle
In our app here the UILabel

00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:25.626 A:middle
sizing did not take very long.

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:27.386 A:middle
It was very short durations.

00:36:27.826 --> 00:36:28.986 A:middle
So messing around with that is

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:29.766 A:middle
not going to improve the

00:36:29.766 --> 00:36:31.096 A:middle
performance of that that much.

00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:32.956 A:middle
But if you have a text intensive

00:36:32.956 --> 00:36:34.586 A:middle
app and you're seeing a lot of

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:36.106 A:middle
time happening in the UILabel

00:36:36.106 --> 00:36:37.886 A:middle
text measurement or you have

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:38.936 A:middle
text view text measurement or

00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:39.956 A:middle
whatever else you're using, you

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:42.136 A:middle
might be able to help it along

00:36:42.136 --> 00:36:43.026 A:middle
if you have some additional

00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:43.566 A:middle
information.

00:36:45.116 --> 00:36:46.296 A:middle
If you know the size that the

00:36:46.296 --> 00:36:47.886 A:middle
text needs to be without doing

00:36:47.886 --> 00:36:49.696 A:middle
all that text measurement, you

00:36:49.696 --> 00:36:50.746 A:middle
can return that size and

00:36:50.746 --> 00:36:53.916 A:middle
intrinsic content size, or if

00:36:53.916 --> 00:36:55.286 A:middle
when you're going to be putting

00:36:55.286 --> 00:36:56.726 A:middle
this view on the screen the

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:57.546 A:middle
constraints are going to be

00:36:57.546 --> 00:36:58.706 A:middle
fully defining the size

00:36:58.776 --> 00:36:59.976 A:middle
regardless of the size of the
