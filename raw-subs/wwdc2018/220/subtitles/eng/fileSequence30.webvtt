00:29:59.646 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
this through the instrument, I

00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:02.386 A:middle
know that these labels

00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:03.876 A:middle
correspond to the Title Label,

00:30:03.876 --> 00:30:05.386 A:middle
Date Label, and our Log Entry

00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:05.686 A:middle
Label.

00:30:07.036 --> 00:30:08.516 A:middle
That's almost all of our views

00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:09.086 A:middle
in this cell.

00:30:09.086 --> 00:30:10.736 A:middle
That's a little concerning.

00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:12.136 A:middle
Let's see what happened.

00:30:13.766 --> 00:30:15.066 A:middle
All right, back to our spec

00:30:15.156 --> 00:30:15.376 A:middle
here.

00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:19.626 A:middle
So look into the code and find

00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:21.096 A:middle
that UpdateConstraints is being

00:30:21.096 --> 00:30:21.566 A:middle
overridden.

00:30:22.526 --> 00:30:24.876 A:middle
And in that method when anything

00:30:24.876 --> 00:30:25.956 A:middle
changes or when

00:30:25.956 --> 00:30:27.426 A:middle
UpdateConstraints runs at all,

00:30:27.896 --> 00:30:28.696 A:middle
we're removing all of the

00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:30.716 A:middle
constraints and then adding back

00:30:30.716 --> 00:30:32.056 A:middle
the ones that we think we still

00:30:32.056 --> 00:30:32.276 A:middle
need.

00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:35.956 A:middle
Well, everything landed back in

00:30:35.956 --> 00:30:37.206 A:middle
the same place where it started.

00:30:37.646 --> 00:30:39.436 A:middle
So that removal just is

00:30:39.436 --> 00:30:41.146 A:middle
contributing to performance

00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:41.516 A:middle
issues.

00:30:42.486 --> 00:30:44.986 A:middle
So in the instance of the social

00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:46.986 A:middle
label here, social avatar thing,

00:30:47.356 --> 00:30:49.176 A:middle
being added and removed, we

00:30:49.176 --> 00:30:50.076 A:middle
don't actually need to pull it

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:50.626 A:middle
all the way out.

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:52.856 A:middle
When you look at the constraints

00:30:52.856 --> 00:30:54.966 A:middle
around this view, you'll see

00:30:54.966 --> 00:30:56.036 A:middle
that they don't actually

00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:57.316 A:middle
interact with anything else,

00:30:57.876 --> 00:30:58.946 A:middle
just that particular view.

00:30:59.516 --> 00:31:01.156 A:middle
So here you can use, you know,
