00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:00.406 A:middle
relationships between views.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.826 A:middle
When it comes to performance, I

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.756 A:middle
think the challenge here is that

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:06.146 A:middle
if all you've said is the

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.276 A:middle
distance between these two

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.286 A:middle
buttons should be 20, it can be

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:10.446 A:middle
hard to understand the

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.606 A:middle
step-by-step process that the

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:13.936 A:middle
machine goes through to do that

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:15.466 A:middle
and that means it can be hard to

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.726 A:middle
understand the expectations

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:18.736 A:middle
around performance and

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:19.826 A:middle
understand what's fast and

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:21.296 A:middle
what's not and generally how

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:22.006 A:middle
things are working.

00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:24.886 A:middle
So that's our goal for this

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:25.156 A:middle
talk.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:27.386 A:middle
It's to really understand that,

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.926 A:middle
to have a good feel for how

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:29.556 A:middle
things are going to work.

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:31.146 A:middle
So we're going to start things

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:32.696 A:middle
off by first showing some of the

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:33.826 A:middle
work that we've been doing in

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:35.556 A:middle
this release for iOS 12 around

00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:36.096 A:middle
performance.

00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:37.256 A:middle
We've been doing a lot of work,

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:40.286 A:middle
that's we get to give this talk.

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:44.646 A:middle
When that's done we're going to

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.166 A:middle
move on to trying to build that

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.636 A:middle
step-by-step understanding that

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.376 A:middle
I was talking about.

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:50.506 A:middle
So we have good intuition and

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:51.576 A:middle
good expectations around

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:52.006 A:middle
performance.

00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:53.626 A:middle
To do that we're going to do

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:55.496 A:middle
something very unusual for us,

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.076 A:middle
which is to go into internals.

00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:58.756 A:middle
So enjoy that please.
