00:32:59.206 --> 00:33:00.226 A:middle
I'm always dealing with an array

00:33:00.226 --> 00:33:00.846 A:middle
of constraints.

00:33:01.856 --> 00:33:02.666 A:middle
Your mileage may vary though.

00:33:03.526 --> 00:33:06.406 A:middle
So the nice thing about this is

00:33:06.406 --> 00:33:08.286 A:middle
that if you are tracking your

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.766 A:middle
constraints properly like this

00:33:10.186 --> 00:33:11.716 A:middle
and you know that you want to

00:33:11.716 --> 00:33:13.276 A:middle
add this image view live in

00:33:13.276 --> 00:33:15.056 A:middle
front of the user, you can

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:15.876 A:middle
deactivate these

00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:17.426 A:middle
noImageConstraints, activate the

00:33:17.426 --> 00:33:18.966 A:middle
ImageConstraints and call Layout

00:33:18.966 --> 00:33:20.326 A:middle
in needed inside a View

00:33:20.326 --> 00:33:22.026 A:middle
Animation block and it's going

00:33:22.026 --> 00:33:23.146 A:middle
to animate nicely into your

00:33:23.146 --> 00:33:23.416 A:middle
view.

00:33:24.126 --> 00:33:25.036 A:middle
If you tried to do this with

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:25.996 A:middle
deactivating all of your

00:33:25.996 --> 00:33:26.886 A:middle
constraints and putting them

00:33:26.886 --> 00:33:29.236 A:middle
back in, it would look very

00:33:29.236 --> 00:33:29.796 A:middle
interesting.

00:33:29.986 --> 00:33:30.756 A:middle
Let's say it that way.

00:33:31.696 --> 00:33:33.006 A:middle
All right, so now that we've

00:33:33.006 --> 00:33:34.296 A:middle
debugged this and we're working

00:33:34.296 --> 00:33:35.266 A:middle
with groups of constraints

00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:36.536 A:middle
instead of throwing everything

00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:38.026 A:middle
at it, let's look at what it

00:33:38.026 --> 00:33:38.646 A:middle
will look like.

00:33:38.706 --> 00:33:39.376 A:middle
This is what it looked like

00:33:39.376 --> 00:33:40.566 A:middle
originally just to remind you.

00:33:41.706 --> 00:33:44.906 A:middle
Let's scroll to the top.

00:33:44.906 --> 00:33:45.216 A:middle
It's very bad.

00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:46.256 A:middle
And this is what it looks like

00:33:46.256 --> 00:33:48.876 A:middle
after we've debugged it.

00:33:48.966 --> 00:33:50.136 A:middle
And that is much smoother.

00:33:50.776 --> 00:33:51.676 A:middle
Thank you.

00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:54.031 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:54.046 --> 00:33:54.986 A:middle
But wait there's more!

00:33:55.596 --> 00:33:57.206 A:middle
I actually took this video on

00:33:57.306 --> 00:33:57.936 A:middle
iOS 11.

00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:00.586 A:middle
This is not taking advantage of
