00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:01.256 A:middle
updateConstraints?

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:03.396 A:middle
And a good way to do that is use

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:03.936 A:middle
Interface Builder.

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:05.796 A:middle
If you can use Interface Builder

00:11:06.026 --> 00:11:06.506 A:middle
you should.

00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:08.606 A:middle
It's great for all sorts of

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:08.946 A:middle
reasons.

00:11:08.946 --> 00:11:11.276 A:middle
It puts you on a good path.

00:11:11.466 --> 00:11:13.206 A:middle
OK, so that's great.

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:14.876 A:middle
We've now talked about that.

00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:15.856 A:middle
I think we have a better

00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:17.286 A:middle
understanding for why that's

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:18.746 A:middle
problematic, at least somewhat

00:11:18.966 --> 00:11:20.266 A:middle
by analogy sub use.

00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:22.486 A:middle
But for the purposes of this

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:23.606 A:middle
talk we want to do better than

00:11:23.606 --> 00:11:23.846 A:middle
that.

00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:25.706 A:middle
We don't just want to say this

00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:26.336 A:middle
is bad.

00:11:26.536 --> 00:11:28.376 A:middle
We want to really understand it

00:11:28.376 --> 00:11:29.666 A:middle
and understand the process.

00:11:30.366 --> 00:11:32.956 A:middle
So to do that we're now going to

00:11:33.016 --> 00:11:34.816 A:middle
peel back the covers and start

00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:36.596 A:middle
to really see what really

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:36.976 A:middle
happens.

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:42.156 A:middle
So when we activate these

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:43.096 A:middle
constraints, when we add the

00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:45.246 A:middle
constraints, what is the process

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:45.626 A:middle
that occurs?

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:48.016 A:middle
Let's diagram it out at a high

00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:48.276 A:middle
level.

00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:50.856 A:middle
So if this is the view that

00:11:50.856 --> 00:11:51.946 A:middle
we're adding the constraints to,

00:11:53.056 --> 00:11:55.596 A:middle
this view is in a window.

00:11:55.726 --> 00:11:57.406 A:middle
Hanging off the window is an

00:11:57.406 --> 00:11:59.426 A:middle
internal object called the

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:00.086 A:middle
engine.
