00:30:59.516 --> 00:31:01.156 A:middle
So here you can use, you know,

00:31:01.156 --> 00:31:03.366 A:middle
this neat little feature called

00:31:03.566 --> 00:31:04.816 A:middle
setHidden, maybe you've heard of

00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:05.536 A:middle
it.

00:31:05.656 --> 00:31:07.936 A:middle
And because it's not affecting

00:31:07.936 --> 00:31:09.686 A:middle
any of the views around it, it's

00:31:09.686 --> 00:31:10.626 A:middle
just going to disappear, it's

00:31:10.626 --> 00:31:11.866 A:middle
constraints stay in place and

00:31:11.866 --> 00:31:13.656 A:middle
this is a very, very, very cheap

00:31:14.136 --> 00:31:15.846 A:middle
way to hide and show views,

00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:17.476 A:middle
rather than removing them from

00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:18.036 A:middle
the hierarchy.

00:31:18.986 --> 00:31:19.736 A:middle
So that's fine.

00:31:20.246 --> 00:31:21.156 A:middle
But this is a really simple

00:31:21.156 --> 00:31:21.556 A:middle
example.

00:31:21.556 --> 00:31:22.546 A:middle
What about the image view?

00:31:23.016 --> 00:31:24.606 A:middle
All right, so for the image

00:31:24.606 --> 00:31:25.806 A:middle
view, again we might we might

00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:26.686 A:middle
want to try removing all

00:31:26.686 --> 00:31:28.176 A:middle
constraints and then adding back

00:31:28.626 --> 00:31:30.206 A:middle
the ones we already had plus the

00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:30.896 A:middle
image view ones.

00:31:31.816 --> 00:31:33.526 A:middle
And again, everything is landing

00:31:33.526 --> 00:31:34.446 A:middle
in the same place so we're

00:31:34.446 --> 00:31:35.356 A:middle
experiencing churn.

00:31:36.566 --> 00:31:37.776 A:middle
Well, in a situation like this

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:39.326 A:middle
how I want you to think about it

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:40.696 A:middle
is to look at groups of

00:31:40.696 --> 00:31:41.176 A:middle
constraints.

00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:43.446 A:middle
So let's start with this group

00:31:43.446 --> 00:31:44.366 A:middle
that I'm highlighting here in

00:31:44.366 --> 00:31:44.716 A:middle
green.

00:31:45.756 --> 00:31:48.256 A:middle
These constraints stay the same

00:31:48.446 --> 00:31:49.476 A:middle
in every one of our layouts.

00:31:50.466 --> 00:31:51.386 A:middle
Once we're doing the hide and

00:31:51.386 --> 00:31:53.286 A:middle
show on the sharing view that

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:54.196 A:middle
doesn't need to change, the

00:31:54.196 --> 00:31:56.356 A:middle
avatar view never moves, and the

00:31:56.356 --> 00:31:59.006 A:middle
labels never move other than the

00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:00.346 A:middle
log entry label being able to
