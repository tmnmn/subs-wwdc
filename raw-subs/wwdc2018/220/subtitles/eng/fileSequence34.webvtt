00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:00.586 A:middle
This is not taking advantage of

00:34:00.586 --> 00:34:01.556 A:middle
any of our performance

00:34:01.556 --> 00:34:02.826 A:middle
improvements in iOS 12.

00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:05.376 A:middle
This is just the client code

00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:07.396 A:middle
doing things more efficiently.

00:34:07.396 --> 00:34:09.626 A:middle
In iOS12 it also looks great.

00:34:09.626 --> 00:34:13.416 A:middle
And of course fabulous

00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:14.016 A:middle
[laughing].

00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:16.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:17.056 --> 00:34:17.446 A:middle
Yes, it's great.

00:34:20.396 --> 00:34:21.815 A:middle
So how do we avoid constraint

00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:22.106 A:middle
churn?

00:34:23.176 --> 00:34:24.545 A:middle
Well, avoid removing all of your

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:25.106 A:middle
constraints.

00:34:25.106 --> 00:34:26.206 A:middle
That's usually going to put you

00:34:26.206 --> 00:34:27.406 A:middle
into a situation where you have

00:34:27.406 --> 00:34:29.036 A:middle
to put a bunch of them back and

00:34:29.036 --> 00:34:30.956 A:middle
that's going to land you in a

00:34:30.956 --> 00:34:32.596 A:middle
position where you're relaying

00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:33.626 A:middle
out frames that don't need to --

00:34:33.626 --> 00:34:34.795 A:middle
or relaying out views that don't

00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:35.636 A:middle
need to be laid out again.

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:38.286 A:middle
If you have a set of constraints

00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:39.626 A:middle
that going to be common to all

00:34:39.626 --> 00:34:40.585 A:middle
of the potential layouts in your

00:34:40.585 --> 00:34:42.556 A:middle
app, add them one and then leave

00:34:42.556 --> 00:34:43.085 A:middle
them alone.

00:34:43.156 --> 00:34:44.295 A:middle
This is a good use for Interface

00:34:44.295 --> 00:34:45.326 A:middle
Builder and the initial layout

00:34:45.326 --> 00:34:46.916 A:middle
of your app.

00:34:46.916 --> 00:34:47.786 A:middle
Changes to the constraints that

00:34:47.786 --> 00:34:48.826 A:middle
need changing but don't change

00:34:48.826 --> 00:34:49.585 A:middle
the ones that don't need

00:34:49.585 --> 00:34:49.956 A:middle
changing.

00:34:50.886 --> 00:34:51.946 A:middle
Kind of tautological but it

00:34:52.295 --> 00:34:52.755 A:middle
seems good.

00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:54.606 A:middle
And then you have a neat trick

00:34:54.606 --> 00:34:56.786 A:middle
now for hiding views instead of

00:34:56.786 --> 00:34:58.086 A:middle
removing them when that makes

00:34:58.086 --> 00:34:58.436 A:middle
sense.

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
All right, so that was
