00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:00.746 A:middle
to remove and change constraint

00:29:01.776 --> 00:29:05.326 A:middle
instances and finally sizing for

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:06.716 A:middle
UILabel and other text views.

00:29:06.906 --> 00:29:08.286 A:middle
This one says UILabel because

00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:09.156 A:middle
that's what's in this app.

00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:11.026 A:middle
It's also going to track other

00:29:11.026 --> 00:29:12.186 A:middle
types of text views as well.

00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:16.286 A:middle
So this was taken with that app

00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:18.556 A:middle
scrolling, so what do we look at

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:18.816 A:middle
here?

00:29:19.206 --> 00:29:21.136 A:middle
There are several peaks in the

00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:24.236 A:middle
CPU view but let's zoom in on

00:29:24.236 --> 00:29:25.776 A:middle
this one because right below it

00:29:25.776 --> 00:29:27.106 A:middle
I see a big jump in constraint

00:29:27.106 --> 00:29:28.386 A:middle
churn and that's a little

00:29:28.386 --> 00:29:28.926 A:middle
concerning.

00:29:29.906 --> 00:29:31.396 A:middle
So if you highlight this view

00:29:31.526 --> 00:29:32.966 A:middle
and go down to the detailed view

00:29:33.666 --> 00:29:35.486 A:middle
in instruments, what you'll see

00:29:35.726 --> 00:29:36.846 A:middle
is a list of the views that are

00:29:36.846 --> 00:29:38.396 A:middle
affected by churn by view

00:29:38.396 --> 00:29:38.896 A:middle
description.

00:29:39.586 --> 00:29:40.556 A:middle
And we are grouping them by

00:29:40.556 --> 00:29:42.326 A:middle
Superview so that in an instance

00:29:42.326 --> 00:29:44.576 A:middle
of say Table View Cells, it's

00:29:44.576 --> 00:29:46.486 A:middle
easier to see that it's

00:29:46.486 --> 00:29:48.286 A:middle
happening over and over in a

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.556 A:middle
specific context and not

00:29:49.556 --> 00:29:50.116 A:middle
different ones.

00:29:51.016 --> 00:29:52.536 A:middle
So in this instance we see that

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.586 A:middle
the avatar view and three labels

00:29:54.966 --> 00:29:55.956 A:middle
are experiencing churn.

00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:59.646 A:middle
And since I am the one who ran

00:29:59.646 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
this through the instrument, I
