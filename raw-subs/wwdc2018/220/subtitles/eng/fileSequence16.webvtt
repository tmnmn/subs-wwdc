00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.216 A:middle
view we'll call setBounds at

00:16:00.216 --> 00:16:02.076 A:middle
setCenter on that Subview.

00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:04.606 A:middle
And that is the entire process.

00:16:06.146 --> 00:16:07.686 A:middle
So just step back and think for

00:16:07.686 --> 00:16:08.096 A:middle
a second.

00:16:08.096 --> 00:16:08.996 A:middle
Like, that is the step-by-step

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:09.976 A:middle
process of Layout.

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.716 A:middle
If you can try to internalize

00:16:12.716 --> 00:16:13.906 A:middle
that and get a feel for it,

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:15.236 A:middle
you're going to have a much,

00:16:15.236 --> 00:16:17.066 A:middle
much, much better feel for

00:16:17.066 --> 00:16:19.166 A:middle
performance expectations around

00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:19.586 A:middle
this stuff.

00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:21.896 A:middle
In fact, let's see how that's

00:16:21.896 --> 00:16:23.676 A:middle
going right now, because now

00:16:24.196 --> 00:16:26.206 A:middle
when we look at this and we look

00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:26.886 A:middle
at this method that we were

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:28.416 A:middle
looking at that where we're

00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:29.506 A:middle
deactivating constraints and

00:16:29.506 --> 00:16:30.736 A:middle
we're reactivating constraints,

00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:32.346 A:middle
think about what we just did and

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:33.656 A:middle
think about what the engine is

00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:34.206 A:middle
going to be doing.

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:36.626 A:middle
It's going to look like this.

00:16:40.426 --> 00:16:42.136 A:middle
Which we call churning [laughs].

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:45.226 A:middle
So each operation it's doing is

00:16:45.226 --> 00:16:47.246 A:middle
not super expensive, but it's

00:16:47.246 --> 00:16:49.576 A:middle
doing a lot of them and it's

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:51.086 A:middle
just completely unnecessary.

00:16:51.086 --> 00:16:52.196 A:middle
This work is wasted.

00:16:52.726 --> 00:16:54.456 A:middle
So if you can feel this in your

00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:56.336 A:middle
heart, if you can really feel

00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:57.636 A:middle
that this is what is happening

00:16:58.046 --> 00:16:59.236 A:middle
when you do this, then you're

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:00.046 A:middle
going to be in good shape.
