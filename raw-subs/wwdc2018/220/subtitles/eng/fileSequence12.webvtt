00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:00.086 A:middle
engine.

00:12:00.516 --> 00:12:01.626 A:middle
And the engine is the

00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:03.066 A:middle
computational core of Auto

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:03.296 A:middle
Layout.

00:12:03.816 --> 00:12:06.246 A:middle
When the constraint is added

00:12:06.576 --> 00:12:10.336 A:middle
what will happen is that we make

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:12.146 A:middle
an equation, which corresponds

00:12:12.146 --> 00:12:13.616 A:middle
to the constraints, and we add

00:12:13.616 --> 00:12:15.846 A:middle
that equation to the engine.

00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:18.306 A:middle
The last object to understand in

00:12:18.306 --> 00:12:19.906 A:middle
the diagram is that the equation

00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:22.996 A:middle
is in terms of variables where a

00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:24.526 A:middle
variable is like, you know, if I

00:12:24.526 --> 00:12:25.936 A:middle
hand you an equation and I say

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:28.336 A:middle
solve for X, X is a variable.

00:12:29.396 --> 00:12:30.666 A:middle
The things that we need to solve

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.326 A:middle
for in this case is the frame

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:34.746 A:middle
data of a view.

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:36.356 A:middle
So there will be four variables

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.916 A:middle
for every view, which is the min

00:12:37.916 --> 00:12:40.246 A:middle
X, the min Y, the width, and the

00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:40.906 A:middle
height.

00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:43.536 A:middle
OK, so let's go into this

00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:43.956 A:middle
process.

00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:45.436 A:middle
So this was the layout we were

00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:45.906 A:middle
going to do.

00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:46.976 A:middle
We're going to focus just on the

00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:48.166 A:middle
horizontal constraints for

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:49.386 A:middle
simplicity, but we're going to

00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:50.486 A:middle
follow through the process.

00:12:51.356 --> 00:12:52.496 A:middle
So the first thing that happens,

00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:53.996 A:middle
as we said, is we make these

00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:55.536 A:middle
equations, which look like this.

00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:57.986 A:middle
These are pretty straight

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:58.366 A:middle
forward.

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:00.656 A:middle
The most interesting one is I
