00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.236 A:middle
important changes in just how

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:01.876 A:middle
UICollectionView uses Auto

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:03.576 A:middle
Layout and is more performance

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:04.866 A:middle
due to it.

00:04:05.376 --> 00:04:07.186 A:middle
Which is a good segue to the

00:04:07.186 --> 00:04:09.186 A:middle
rest of the talk, which is how

00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:10.116 A:middle
you can do that too.

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:11.786 A:middle
So how to use it properly.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.286 A:middle
When we were going through these

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:16.505 A:middle
I think a lot of the time the

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:17.956 A:middle
reason why we were able to make

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:19.375 A:middle
all these improvements is that

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.786 A:middle
we have a good mental model for

00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:24.336 A:middle
how things are put together and

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:26.226 A:middle
how it performs, how it works.

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.156 A:middle
We want to help you develop that

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:29.756 A:middle
model as well.

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:31.876 A:middle
So to frame this we're going to

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:34.126 A:middle
go through an example case, some

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:36.726 A:middle
client code, that is not -- that

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:38.036 A:middle
has some issues and we're going

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:38.676 A:middle
to discuss why.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:40.796 A:middle
So your code may or may not have

00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:42.166 A:middle
this particular issue, but we

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.226 A:middle
did choose what we thought was

00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:44.636 A:middle
the most common thing that we

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:45.816 A:middle
saw when we went through all

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.496 A:middle
these client apps.

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:49.146 A:middle
But even if you don't have this

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:50.876 A:middle
particular issue, the work we do

00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:52.476 A:middle
to go through what's happening

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:53.596 A:middle
should be meaningful to

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:55.326 A:middle
everybody and probably new to

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.026 A:middle
almost everybody.

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:58.426 A:middle
So let's do it.

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:00.756 A:middle
This is the case we're going to
