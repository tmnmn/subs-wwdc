00:25:00.226 --> 00:25:01.186 A:middle
Try not to churn your

00:25:01.186 --> 00:25:01.766 A:middle
constraints.

00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:03.036 A:middle
That's when you're doing all

00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:04.576 A:middle
this work that just doesn't

00:25:04.576 --> 00:25:04.826 A:middle
matter.

00:25:05.116 --> 00:25:05.686 A:middle
So don't do it.

00:25:06.326 --> 00:25:08.256 A:middle
When you do work with

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:09.876 A:middle
constraints it's basic algebra

00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:11.566 A:middle
and that algebra is happening

00:25:11.566 --> 00:25:12.706 A:middle
when you add constraints, when

00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:14.586 A:middle
you remove constraints, when you

00:25:14.586 --> 00:25:16.706 A:middle
call set constant, that's the

00:25:16.706 --> 00:25:17.466 A:middle
primary times.

00:25:17.956 --> 00:25:20.956 A:middle
And then also, you know, when we

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:22.196 A:middle
have this error minimization

00:25:22.746 --> 00:25:22.866 A:middle
phase.

00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:26.916 A:middle
The way to think about what Auto

00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:28.546 A:middle
Layout does is that it's a cash

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:29.806 A:middle
for your layout, we saw the

00:25:29.806 --> 00:25:31.226 A:middle
engine sort of contains all

00:25:31.226 --> 00:25:33.016 A:middle
those solved values and it's a

00:25:33.016 --> 00:25:34.766 A:middle
dependency tracker so that when

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:36.916 A:middle
things change we can update

00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:38.586 A:middle
those values in a super, super

00:25:38.586 --> 00:25:39.296 A:middle
targeted way.

00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:41.016 A:middle
Which leads to our last point,

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:43.236 A:middle
which is that you only pay for

00:25:43.236 --> 00:25:44.216 A:middle
the features that you're using.

00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.916 A:middle
That's what we talked about.

00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:48.566 A:middle
You know, that's your intuition.

00:25:48.956 --> 00:25:51.186 A:middle
And for the rest of the talk I'm

00:25:51.186 --> 00:25:53.376 A:middle
going to turn it over to Kasia

00:25:53.376 --> 00:25:54.556 A:middle
because if you, again, if you

00:25:54.556 --> 00:25:55.916 A:middle
only rely on intuition, things

00:25:55.916 --> 00:25:56.586 A:middle
are not going to go well.

00:25:56.866 --> 00:25:58.336 A:middle
So she's now going to go into

00:25:58.336 --> 00:25:59.946 A:middle
some analysis, avoid we talked

00:25:59.946 --> 00:26:01.286 A:middle
about and putting that intuition
