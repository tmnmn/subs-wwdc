00:21:59.856 --> 00:22:01.186 A:middle
So there are some other things

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:01.546 A:middle
you can do.

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:04.046 A:middle
And let's discuss.

00:22:04.626 --> 00:22:05.946 A:middle
So you can say that some

00:22:05.946 --> 00:22:07.186 A:middle
particular view should be at

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:08.346 A:middle
least 100 points wide.

00:22:08.466 --> 00:22:09.366 A:middle
You can use inequalities.

00:22:10.106 --> 00:22:10.806 A:middle
What does that cost?

00:22:11.736 --> 00:22:12.816 A:middle
Very, very, very little.

00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:13.876 A:middle
Compared to just saying it's

00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:15.736 A:middle
equal to hundred points wide.

00:22:15.736 --> 00:22:17.346 A:middle
Since we went internals a little

00:22:17.656 --> 00:22:19.166 A:middle
bit, it's going to coast exactly

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:19.966 A:middle
one more variable.

00:22:20.236 --> 00:22:20.636 A:middle
That's it.

00:22:21.156 --> 00:22:23.936 A:middle
You can also call set constant.

00:22:24.436 --> 00:22:26.066 A:middle
The example use case for this is

00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:27.926 A:middle
something like I have a gesture

00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:29.206 A:middle
recognizer and I'm kind of

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:31.396 A:middle
trying to drag a view around and

00:22:31.396 --> 00:22:32.676 A:middle
what I'm going to do is every

00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:34.976 A:middle
time I receive a call from the

00:22:34.976 --> 00:22:36.196 A:middle
gesture recognizer I'm going to

00:22:36.196 --> 00:22:38.416 A:middle
take its translation and I'm

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:39.296 A:middle
going to pump it into a

00:22:39.296 --> 00:22:41.006 A:middle
constraint by calling set

00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:43.866 A:middle
constant on that constraint with

00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:45.896 A:middle
that translation value.

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:48.966 A:middle
OK, what that's going to do is

00:22:48.966 --> 00:22:50.616 A:middle
we talked about how the engine

00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:51.786 A:middle
is a dependency tracker.

00:22:52.346 --> 00:22:53.976 A:middle
This exploits that to the

00:22:53.976 --> 00:22:55.016 A:middle
maximal degree.

00:22:55.656 --> 00:22:58.016 A:middle
So that's sort of a very, very,

00:22:58.016 --> 00:23:00.266 A:middle
very fast one step update of
