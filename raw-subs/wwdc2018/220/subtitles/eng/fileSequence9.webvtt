00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:01.076 A:middle
it's called we're deactivating

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.196 A:middle
constraints and then activating

00:09:03.196 --> 00:09:03.996 A:middle
them again new ones.

00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:06.546 A:middle
We are saying this is analogous

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.326 A:middle
to layoutSubviews.

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:09.616 A:middle
So if we wrote the exact same

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.966 A:middle
code in layout Subviews that is

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:14.076 A:middle
the analog, that would be as if

00:09:14.476 --> 00:09:16.996 A:middle
you -- every time layoutSubviews

00:09:16.996 --> 00:09:18.436 A:middle
was called you destroyed all

00:09:18.436 --> 00:09:20.236 A:middle
your Subviews, created them from

00:09:20.236 --> 00:09:22.076 A:middle
scratch and then added them

00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:22.346 A:middle
again.

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:25.596 A:middle
And I think a lot of people have

00:09:25.596 --> 00:09:26.836 A:middle
the completely accurate

00:09:26.836 --> 00:09:27.946 A:middle
intuition that that's not going

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:28.726 A:middle
to perform very well.

00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:31.916 A:middle
So the thing to really get is

00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:33.266 A:middle
that it's the same.

00:09:33.586 --> 00:09:34.976 A:middle
Whatever intuition you take from

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:36.436 A:middle
that apply it to

00:09:36.436 --> 00:09:37.756 A:middle
updateConstraints as well.

00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:39.216 A:middle
When you are ripping down

00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:40.336 A:middle
constraints like that you're

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:42.376 A:middle
doing a lot of extra work.

00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:43.156 A:middle
So how do you fix it?

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.076 A:middle
Well, you need to use -- as we

00:09:46.076 --> 00:09:47.116 A:middle
were saying, you need to make

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:48.536 A:middle
sure that you're not doing it

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:49.286 A:middle
more than once.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:50.606 A:middle
It's for deferring work.

00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:53.076 A:middle
So it should be something like

00:09:53.076 --> 00:09:54.576 A:middle
this, we say did we already do

00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:55.056 A:middle
this work?

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:57.326 A:middle
If we did then just don't do

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:57.856 A:middle
anything at all.

00:09:57.856 --> 00:09:58.886 A:middle
If we haven't done it yet, then

00:09:58.886 --> 00:09:59.816 A:middle
sure set up those constraints

00:09:59.816 --> 00:09:59.976 A:middle
once.
