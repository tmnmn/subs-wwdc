00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:02.836 A:middle
You would substitute out for the

00:14:02.836 --> 00:14:03.826 A:middle
ones that you already had in

00:14:03.826 --> 00:14:03.996 A:middle
there.

00:14:04.146 --> 00:14:05.286 A:middle
And that's exactly what's going

00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:05.646 A:middle
to happen.

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:08.486 A:middle
If you are profiling, you'll see

00:14:08.486 --> 00:14:10.356 A:middle
there is a genuine method in the

00:14:10.356 --> 00:14:12.186 A:middle
engine that contains the word

00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:13.986 A:middle
substitute as well as another

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:16.956 A:middle
140 characters because we are

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.776 A:middle
Cocoa Code Programmers.

00:14:18.776 --> 00:14:21.716 A:middle
But and that's what it will do.

00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:23.726 A:middle
And then, you know, and the last

00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:26.306 A:middle
equation comes in and this looks

00:14:26.306 --> 00:14:26.726 A:middle
done.

00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:29.106 A:middle
it looks like that was all the

00:14:29.106 --> 00:14:30.636 A:middle
work that had to happen at least

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.656 A:middle
in this case to solve for those

00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:34.466 A:middle
variables and that's true.

00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:36.646 A:middle
That's what I want to understand

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:38.506 A:middle
at this point is that the work

00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:39.856 A:middle
that happens is both not very

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:40.546 A:middle
complicated.

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.856 A:middle
It corresponds very, very, very

00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:43.956 A:middle
closely to what you would do if

00:14:43.956 --> 00:14:46.566 A:middle
you were doing it by hand.

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:47.476 A:middle
And it's also not very

00:14:47.476 --> 00:14:47.916 A:middle
expensive.

00:14:48.266 --> 00:14:49.826 A:middle
It's just sort of substituting

00:14:49.826 --> 00:14:50.296 A:middle
out like this.

00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:51.626 A:middle
That's the work it does.

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:54.976 A:middle
OK, so now we have sort of

00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:56.686 A:middle
solved for these variables in

00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:57.616 A:middle
the engine but that's not

00:14:57.616 --> 00:14:57.936 A:middle
layout.

00:14:58.386 --> 00:15:00.716 A:middle
So let's finish the process.
