Last, if you only ever rely on

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.316 A:middle
our intuition for performance,

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:07.706 A:middle
it's not going to work out very

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:07.896 A:middle
well.

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:10.776 A:middle
So we will then look -- Kasia

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:12.376 A:middle
will take over and we'll analyze

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:14.686 A:middle
code and we'll sort of show how

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:16.696 A:middle
to merge your intuition with,

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:17.736 A:middle
you know, practice.

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:20.126 A:middle
But let's get to it.

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:22.226 A:middle
So first as is traditional for

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.326 A:middle
an Apple presentation, we're

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:23.916 A:middle
going to look at a bunch of

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:24.676 A:middle
numbers and brag.

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:28.796 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:31.116 A:middle
Here we have, what we're looking

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:32.806 A:middle
at here is a benchmark.

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.456 A:middle
So the way we approached this

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.536 A:middle
work is we went out and looked a

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:38.816 A:middle
bunch of third party apps as

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:40.406 A:middle
well as our own apps and we

00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:41.906 A:middle
tried to isolate what we saw

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:44.646 A:middle
happening into test cases that

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:45.476 A:middle
we could then benchmark.

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:47.056 A:middle
So this one here, what we're

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:49.006 A:middle
looking at, is UICollectionView

00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.486 A:middle
with self-sizing cells and on

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.236 A:middle
the whichever side looks bad is

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:59.136 A:middle
iOS 11, which hopefully looked

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:00.086 A:middle
janky and bad.
