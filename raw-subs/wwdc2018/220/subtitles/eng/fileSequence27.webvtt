00:26:59.206 --> 00:27:00.186 A:middle
you're going to need some

00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.606 A:middle
spacing, you're going to need

00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:03.416 A:middle
some sizing and you're probably

00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:04.276 A:middle
going to need some alignment

00:27:04.366 --> 00:27:04.516 A:middle
too.

00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:08.036 A:middle
But this is actually not a pure

00:27:08.036 --> 00:27:08.946 A:middle
social media app.

00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:11.036 A:middle
It is a semi social media app,

00:27:11.476 --> 00:27:12.476 A:middle
where you can choose whether you

00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:13.276 A:middle
want to share things.

00:27:14.176 --> 00:27:15.986 A:middle
So there's also optionally a

00:27:15.986 --> 00:27:16.756 A:middle
view that says that you've

00:27:16.756 --> 00:27:17.846 A:middle
shared and who you've shared

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:18.016 A:middle
with.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:20.376 A:middle
And no social media app would be

00:27:20.376 --> 00:27:22.166 A:middle
complete without the ability to

00:27:22.166 --> 00:27:23.036 A:middle
share cat pictures.

00:27:23.936 --> 00:27:24.896 A:middle
So that's another layout that

00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:25.846 A:middle
you might have to put in.

00:27:26.836 --> 00:27:28.326 A:middle
And maybe you don't even want to

00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:29.236 A:middle
share that cat picture because

00:27:29.236 --> 00:27:30.346 A:middle
it's just too good, you want to

00:27:30.346 --> 00:27:31.066 A:middle
keep it to yourself.

00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:33.586 A:middle
So we have four very similar

00:27:33.586 --> 00:27:33.976 A:middle
layouts.

00:27:34.626 --> 00:27:35.996 A:middle
They're not the same and there's

00:27:35.996 --> 00:27:36.776 A:middle
going to need to be some

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:38.196 A:middle
adjustment when these table view

00:27:38.196 --> 00:27:39.306 A:middle
cells come on to the screen.

00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:40.396 A:middle
If I didn't mention it these are

00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:41.156 A:middle
in table view cells.

00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:43.406 A:middle
And let's say that you are

00:27:43.406 --> 00:27:45.236 A:middle
working on performance in this

00:27:45.236 --> 00:27:47.026 A:middle
app and you ran it for the first

00:27:47.026 --> 00:27:48.266 A:middle
time and this is the scrolling

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:49.036 A:middle
performance you got.

00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:51.316 A:middle
And there are a lot of hiccups

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:52.706 A:middle
there, especially on the scroll

00:27:52.706 --> 00:27:52.976 A:middle
back to top.

00:27:53.086 --> 00:27:55.666 A:middle
So you're like, OK, how do I

00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:57.026 A:middle
improve this app?

00:27:57.026 --> 00:27:57.716 A:middle
What's going on?

00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:00.986 A:middle
So I get to introduce something
