00:39:01.026 --> 00:39:02.266 A:middle
All right, now we come to my

00:39:02.266 --> 00:39:03.126 A:middle
very favorite topic in the

00:39:03.126 --> 00:39:03.366 A:middle
world.

00:39:03.836 --> 00:39:05.216 A:middle
Unsatisfiable Constraints.

00:39:06.226 --> 00:39:09.526 A:middle
OK, so what are unsatisfiable

00:39:09.526 --> 00:39:10.146 A:middle
constraints?

00:39:10.226 --> 00:39:11.116 A:middle
If you haven't run into this

00:39:11.116 --> 00:39:13.216 A:middle
before, this is what happens

00:39:13.216 --> 00:39:14.856 A:middle
when you do something like, hey

00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:16.806 A:middle
this view should be 50 points

00:39:16.806 --> 00:39:18.486 A:middle
wide, also it should be 200

00:39:18.486 --> 00:39:18.936 A:middle
points wide.

00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:21.356 A:middle
Well, that's not really going to

00:39:21.356 --> 00:39:21.606 A:middle
work.

00:39:21.976 --> 00:39:23.686 A:middle
These are not actually quantum

00:39:23.686 --> 00:39:24.116 A:middle
phones.

00:39:25.276 --> 00:39:26.436 A:middle
You know, I can't speak to the

00:39:26.436 --> 00:39:30.696 A:middle
future but so the engine has to

00:39:30.696 --> 00:39:31.876 A:middle
kind of calculate the fact that

00:39:31.876 --> 00:39:33.906 A:middle
there's no layout available and

00:39:33.906 --> 00:39:35.566 A:middle
break a constraint in order to

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:37.386 A:middle
generate some sort of layout for

00:39:37.386 --> 00:39:37.556 A:middle
you.

00:39:38.536 --> 00:39:39.626 A:middle
When it breaks that constraint

00:39:40.246 --> 00:39:42.026 A:middle
it sends a very detailed log to

00:39:42.386 --> 00:39:43.496 A:middle
your debugger, possibly you've

00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:46.026 A:middle
seen it, that says, hey

00:39:46.026 --> 00:39:47.316 A:middle
unsatisfiable constraints.

00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:48.476 A:middle
Here's the constraint that I

00:39:48.476 --> 00:39:49.876 A:middle
broke and here's all the other

00:39:49.876 --> 00:39:51.476 A:middle
ones that affected, that caused

00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:52.186 A:middle
me to have to break it.

00:39:53.146 --> 00:39:54.836 A:middle
So this can sometimes affect

00:39:55.366 --> 00:39:56.856 A:middle
performance directly and it can

00:39:56.856 --> 00:39:57.986 A:middle
also mask other issues.

00:39:57.986 --> 00:39:59.186 A:middle
So it's a good idea to get them

00:39:59.186 --> 00:39:59.596 A:middle
debugged.
