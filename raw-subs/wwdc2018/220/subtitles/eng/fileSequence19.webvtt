00:18:59.276 --> 00:19:00.706 A:middle
That's perfect marks for this

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:01.106 A:middle
kind of thing.

00:19:01.246 --> 00:19:03.816 A:middle
So I want to stress this again,

00:19:03.816 --> 00:19:05.496 A:middle
the reason why it's linear is

00:19:05.496 --> 00:19:06.306 A:middle
because there aren't any

00:19:06.306 --> 00:19:07.546 A:middle
dependencies between these

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:07.886 A:middle
pieces.

00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:09.596 A:middle
If you do have a dependency,

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.846 A:middle
then it will tie those blocks of

00:19:11.846 --> 00:19:14.106 A:middle
equations together and that will

00:19:14.106 --> 00:19:15.996 A:middle
be somewhat more, you know, more

00:19:15.996 --> 00:19:18.096 A:middle
computation to deal with but

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:19.876 A:middle
that's only if you use it.

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:21.456 A:middle
And of course if you do have

00:19:21.456 --> 00:19:22.236 A:middle
something like that, you know,

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.446 A:middle
if you're doing it by hand of

00:19:23.446 --> 00:19:24.246 A:middle
course it's going to be a little

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.396 A:middle
bit more expensive that's what

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:25.776 A:middle
you expect.

00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:26.986 A:middle
You're doing something more

00:19:26.986 --> 00:19:27.446 A:middle
complicated.

00:19:27.546 --> 00:19:29.626 A:middle
So it's kind of this usual thing

00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:31.456 A:middle
that we often aim for in Cocoa,

00:19:31.456 --> 00:19:32.626 A:middle
which is that the simple things

00:19:32.626 --> 00:19:34.286 A:middle
are simple and the complex

00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:34.976 A:middle
things are possible.

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:36.476 A:middle
In this case it's more like they

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:37.176 A:middle
cost a little more.

00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:38.986 A:middle
But you're not paying for it if

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:41.296 A:middle
you're not using it, which is

00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:43.036 A:middle
actually the right way to think

00:19:43.036 --> 00:19:44.716 A:middle
of the whole engine in terms of

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.726 A:middle
intuition again, you can think

00:19:46.726 --> 00:19:49.206 A:middle
of it as a cache for layout and

00:19:49.206 --> 00:19:50.446 A:middle
as a dependency tracker.

00:19:51.296 --> 00:19:52.736 A:middle
It's very, very targeted.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:54.396 A:middle
It understands which constraints

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:55.896 A:middle
affect which views, and when you

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:58.346 A:middle
change things it just updates

00:19:58.346 --> 00:19:59.526 A:middle
exactly the things that are

00:19:59.526 --> 00:19:59.866 A:middle
needed.
