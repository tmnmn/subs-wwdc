00:37:58.816 --> 00:38:00.236 A:middle
manages its subviews using Auto

00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:00.576 A:middle
Layout.

00:38:01.876 --> 00:38:03.616 A:middle
Not very frequent usage but is

00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:05.306 A:middle
there and can be used.

00:38:05.696 --> 00:38:07.346 A:middle
I want to tell you how this

00:38:07.346 --> 00:38:09.096 A:middle
method works because it might be

00:38:09.096 --> 00:38:10.066 A:middle
a little more expensive than you

00:38:10.066 --> 00:38:10.306 A:middle
think.

00:38:11.736 --> 00:38:13.046 A:middle
When you call System Layout Size

00:38:13.046 --> 00:38:14.926 A:middle
Fitting Size an engine is

00:38:14.966 --> 00:38:15.386 A:middle
created.

00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:17.006 A:middle
Constraints are added to this

00:38:17.006 --> 00:38:18.886 A:middle
engine, the layout is solved,

00:38:19.536 --> 00:38:21.206 A:middle
and then the size of the top

00:38:21.206 --> 00:38:23.546 A:middle
views frame is returned, and

00:38:23.546 --> 00:38:24.666 A:middle
then the engine gets discarded.

00:38:25.706 --> 00:38:26.646 A:middle
So each time you call this

00:38:26.646 --> 00:38:27.916 A:middle
method an engine is being

00:38:27.916 --> 00:38:28.946 A:middle
created and discarded.

00:38:29.856 --> 00:38:31.386 A:middle
While this is fine for small

00:38:31.386 --> 00:38:33.006 A:middle
uses, if you're doing it a lot

00:38:33.286 --> 00:38:34.306 A:middle
you can see how it might start

00:38:34.306 --> 00:38:35.486 A:middle
to build up over time.

00:38:35.706 --> 00:38:37.336 A:middle
So be cautious when calling

00:38:37.336 --> 00:38:38.616 A:middle
System Layout Size Fitting Size.

00:38:39.636 --> 00:38:41.486 A:middle
One of the uses that we

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:42.956 A:middle
sometimes see people do is

00:38:42.996 --> 00:38:44.646 A:middle
forwarding that call from their

00:38:44.646 --> 00:38:45.886 A:middle
self-sizing collection or table

00:38:45.886 --> 00:38:47.636 A:middle
view cell to a content view.

00:38:47.896 --> 00:38:49.186 A:middle
And when you do that you're

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:50.326 A:middle
actually overriding some

00:38:50.326 --> 00:38:51.886 A:middle
optimizations we've made to make

00:38:51.886 --> 00:38:53.026 A:middle
that scrolling, scrolling in

00:38:53.026 --> 00:38:54.716 A:middle
that view faster and you're

00:38:54.716 --> 00:38:55.706 A:middle
adding extra engines.

00:38:56.026 --> 00:38:57.086 A:middle
So if you're currently doing

00:38:57.086 --> 00:38:58.106 A:middle
that and your scrolling is no

00:38:58.106 --> 00:38:59.946 A:middle
good, maybe look into that.
