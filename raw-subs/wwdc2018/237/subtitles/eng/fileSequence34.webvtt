00:33:59.296 --> 00:34:00.866 A:middle
provideThumbnail for request

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:02.316 A:middle
handler method in your

00:34:02.536 --> 00:34:04.326 A:middle
QLThumbnailProvider subclass.

00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:07.816 A:middle
We extensively covered this part

00:34:07.816 --> 00:34:09.795 A:middle
of the Quick Look API in your

00:34:09.826 --> 00:34:14.376 A:middle
session for WWDC 2017, Building

00:34:14.376 --> 00:34:16.106 A:middle
Great Document-Based Apps in iOS

00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:16.556 A:middle
11.

00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:18.166 A:middle
So if you'd like to provide

00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.485 A:middle
thumbnails for your custom file

00:34:19.485 --> 00:34:21.966 A:middle
types I highly encourage you to

00:34:21.966 --> 00:34:23.666 A:middle
check it out.

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:25.485 A:middle
In a nutshell, you will need to

00:34:25.485 --> 00:34:26.936 A:middle
make use of the parameters

00:34:26.936 --> 00:34:28.166 A:middle
contained in the

00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:29.866 A:middle
QLFileThumbnailRequest of the

00:34:29.866 --> 00:34:30.286 A:middle
method.

00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:34.126 A:middle
The URL of the file, the maximum

00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:35.176 A:middle
and minimum sizes of the

00:34:35.176 --> 00:34:37.295 A:middle
thumbnail, and its scale.

00:34:39.596 --> 00:34:41.565 A:middle
For each thumbnail request the

00:34:41.565 --> 00:34:43.646 A:middle
API expects you to create a

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.315 A:middle
QLThumbnailReply object.

00:34:45.916 --> 00:34:48.025 A:middle
This object will have to take

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.335 A:middle
care of generating the

00:34:49.335 --> 00:34:49.886 A:middle
thumbnail.

00:34:50.826 --> 00:34:51.886 A:middle
You will have to provide it to

00:34:51.886 --> 00:34:53.116 A:middle
Quick Look through the

00:34:53.116 --> 00:34:55.286 A:middle
completion handler of the

00:34:57.456 --> 00:34:57.636 A:middle
method.

00:34:57.766 --> 00:34:59.166 A:middle
All right let's see all of this

00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:00.306 A:middle
in action it's demo time.
