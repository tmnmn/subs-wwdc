00:06:57.826 --> 00:07:00.096 A:middle
You want to play audio or video

00:07:00.096 --> 00:07:02.046 A:middle
files without having to deal

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.546 A:middle
with lower-level frameworks.

00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:06.996 A:middle
Or you want to present for

00:07:06.996 --> 00:07:08.946 A:middle
example a scrollable and

00:07:08.946 --> 00:07:11.106 A:middle
zoomable user agreement PDF to

00:07:11.106 --> 00:07:11.646 A:middle
the user.

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:14.026 A:middle
Use Quick Look for this.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:17.876 A:middle
But Quick Look shouldn't be

00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:19.956 A:middle
misused, here's when not to use

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:20.446 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:07:21.936 --> 00:07:22.946 A:middle
Quick Look is all about

00:07:22.946 --> 00:07:24.896 A:middle
previewing but doesn't provide

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:25.826 A:middle
editing features.

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:27.866 A:middle
So if you need to provide

00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:29.806 A:middle
functionality such as image

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:32.746 A:middle
editing, PDF management or movie

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:34.376 A:middle
trimming you need to choose a

00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:34.976 A:middle
different approach.

00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:40.676 A:middle
Similarly, if you need more

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:42.336 A:middle
advanced playback control for

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:43.906 A:middle
your videos Quick Look is

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:45.426 A:middle
probably not the best choice,

00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:47.896 A:middle
you can use AVPlayer instead.

00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:50.016 A:middle
Quick Look is meant to be

00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:51.346 A:middle
presented full screen.

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:53.276 A:middle
If you simply want to present an

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:55.456 A:middle
image, a video or a document

00:07:55.636 --> 00:07:57.356 A:middle
embedded in your layout together

00:07:57.356 --> 00:07:58.936 A:middle
with other views surrounding it

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:00.886 A:middle
you probably want to use
