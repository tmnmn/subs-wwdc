00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.476 A:middle
method that will take care of

00:39:00.476 --> 00:39:01.246 A:middle
drawing the thumbnail,

00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:03.606 A:middle
drawThumbnail for fileURL,

00:39:04.126 --> 00:39:04.866 A:middle
contextSize.

00:39:05.336 --> 00:39:06.676 A:middle
We are going to implement this

00:39:06.676 --> 00:39:08.136 A:middle
helper method in a second.

00:39:08.706 --> 00:39:10.296 A:middle
You may have noticed that our

00:39:10.296 --> 00:39:11.716 A:middle
drawing block returns a Boolean,

00:39:12.576 --> 00:39:13.926 A:middle
this flag indicates if the

00:39:13.926 --> 00:39:15.196 A:middle
thumbnail was successfully drawn

00:39:15.196 --> 00:39:17.266 A:middle
or not once this block will be

00:39:17.266 --> 00:39:18.376 A:middle
used to generate the thumbnail.

00:39:19.396 --> 00:39:21.376 A:middle
Let's now see how we draw our

00:39:21.376 --> 00:39:22.236 A:middle
particle thumbnails.

00:39:24.316 --> 00:39:26.746 A:middle
To draw the thumbnails we make

00:39:26.746 --> 00:39:29.316 A:middle
use of the URL of the file and

00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:30.736 A:middle
of the size of the context we

00:39:30.736 --> 00:39:31.276 A:middle
will draw into.

00:39:32.196 --> 00:39:33.856 A:middle
In this case, we all know the

00:39:33.856 --> 00:39:35.256 A:middle
maximum size of the thumbnail

00:39:35.256 --> 00:39:37.116 A:middle
request since we can generate

00:39:37.116 --> 00:39:38.526 A:middle
particle thumbnails of any size.

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.756 A:middle
Our method first creates a

00:39:41.756 --> 00:39:43.426 A:middle
document that represents the

00:39:43.426 --> 00:39:45.776 A:middle
file and attempts to open it.

00:39:46.226 --> 00:39:48.296 A:middle
If this fails it returns false

00:39:48.336 --> 00:39:49.506 A:middle
to indicate that it could not

00:39:49.506 --> 00:39:50.276 A:middle
generate a thumbnail.

00:39:50.906 --> 00:39:54.066 A:middle
After opening the file it then

00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:56.036 A:middle
creates a particleViewController

00:39:56.626 --> 00:39:57.576 A:middle
that will be used to render the

00:39:57.576 --> 00:39:57.966 A:middle
particles file.

00:39:59.506 --> 00:40:01.136 A:middle
Then it takes a snapshot of the
