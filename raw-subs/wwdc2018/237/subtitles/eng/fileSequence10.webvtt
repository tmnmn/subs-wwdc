00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:02.136 A:middle
basically the URL, where to find

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:04.596 A:middle
the document on disk and

00:10:04.596 --> 00:10:06.936 A:middle
optionally a title that Quick

00:10:06.936 --> 00:10:08.336 A:middle
Look will show in the navigation

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:08.566 A:middle
bar.

00:10:09.136 --> 00:10:12.216 A:middle
The class representing documents

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:14.206 A:middle
in your app needs to conform to

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:15.746 A:middle
the QLPreviewItem protocol.

00:10:16.586 --> 00:10:19.266 A:middle
But by the way, NSURL already

00:10:19.266 --> 00:10:21.376 A:middle
conforms to the QLPreviewItem

00:10:21.376 --> 00:10:23.396 A:middle
protocol, so if you don't need

00:10:23.396 --> 00:10:25.246 A:middle
custom titles you can simply

00:10:25.246 --> 00:10:27.896 A:middle
return NSURL instances in your

00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:29.806 A:middle
data source without implementing

00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:30.936 A:middle
the protocol yourself.

00:10:31.466 --> 00:10:34.896 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:38.136 A:middle
In this scenario our view

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:39.576 A:middle
controller that presents Quick

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:41.766 A:middle
Look acts as the data source of

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.166 A:middle
the QLPreviewController.

00:10:44.496 --> 00:10:46.566 A:middle
Therefore, we let it conform to

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:48.236 A:middle
the QLPreviewController data

00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:50.346 A:middle
source in an extension and we

00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:51.586 A:middle
implement the two methods.

00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:54.986 A:middle
Here we are using an area of

00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:57.046 A:middle
file URLs that acts as the

00:10:57.046 --> 00:10:57.396 A:middle
model.

00:10:57.986 --> 00:10:59.516 A:middle
We return the number of URLs

00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:02.096 A:middle
that we have in the number of
