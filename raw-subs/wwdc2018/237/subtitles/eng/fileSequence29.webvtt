Please note that you can only

00:29:00.946 --> 00:29:02.716 A:middle
provide previews for UTIs you

00:29:02.756 --> 00:29:03.996 A:middle
own and export.

00:29:05.356 --> 00:29:07.146 A:middle
When Quick Look can't natively

00:29:07.146 --> 00:29:09.246 A:middle
preview a file type it will make

00:29:09.246 --> 00:29:10.826 A:middle
use of the content types added

00:29:10.826 --> 00:29:13.986 A:middle
to this array and select an

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:15.306 A:middle
extension that can handle

00:29:15.506 --> 00:29:16.106 A:middle
previewing it.

00:29:16.906 --> 00:29:18.246 A:middle
So make sure to list all file

00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:19.426 A:middle
types [inaudible] extension

00:29:19.426 --> 00:29:19.946 A:middle
support.

00:29:21.056 --> 00:29:22.526 A:middle
Let's see how we achieve this

00:29:22.746 --> 00:29:24.176 A:middle
with our Particles app.

00:29:24.426 --> 00:29:29.576 A:middle
As you can see Particles

00:29:29.576 --> 00:29:30.896 A:middle
declares and exports a new

00:29:31.276 --> 00:29:32.176 A:middle
particles file type.

00:29:32.326 --> 00:29:34.806 A:middle
Its identifier is [inaudible]

00:29:35.486 --> 00:29:37.986 A:middle
example.applesample

00:29:37.986 --> 00:29:39.996 A:middle
code.particles.particles.

00:29:41.296 --> 00:29:43.006 A:middle
Since we wanted our extension to

00:29:43.006 --> 00:29:45.196 A:middle
support particles previews we

00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:47.016 A:middle
added this identifier to the

00:29:47.016 --> 00:29:48.836 A:middle
QLSupportedContentTypes of its

00:29:48.836 --> 00:29:49.566 A:middle
Info.plist.

00:29:50.256 --> 00:29:52.196 A:middle
By the way, if you're interested

00:29:52.196 --> 00:29:54.756 A:middle
in UTIs you should check out the

00:29:54.756 --> 00:29:56.646 A:middle
Documents Manager session of

00:29:56.646 --> 00:29:56.956 A:middle
this year.
