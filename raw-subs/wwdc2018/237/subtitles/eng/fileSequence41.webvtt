00:41:00.426 --> 00:41:02.676 A:middle
Now let's check our preview

00:41:02.676 --> 00:41:03.296 A:middle
extension.

00:41:04.966 --> 00:41:05.376 A:middle
Okay.

00:41:05.376 --> 00:41:07.076 A:middle
So we are in Note and Quick Look

00:41:07.076 --> 00:41:08.126 A:middle
is still showing the blank

00:41:08.126 --> 00:41:09.726 A:middle
screen from the previous time we

00:41:09.726 --> 00:41:11.006 A:middle
tried to previewing your file.

00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:13.016 A:middle
Let's dismiss Quick Look and

00:41:13.016 --> 00:41:13.706 A:middle
present it again.

00:41:16.186 --> 00:41:18.556 A:middle
We now see our great particles

00:41:18.556 --> 00:41:20.796 A:middle
preview, note how easy it was to

00:41:20.796 --> 00:41:23.526 A:middle
make our custom file format

00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:25.186 A:middle
[inaudible] in iOS.

00:41:25.186 --> 00:41:26.556 A:middle
And that's it for the demo.

00:41:27.086 --> 00:41:29.116 A:middle
So what have we learned today?

00:41:29.806 --> 00:41:32.176 A:middle
First, we have shown you how

00:41:32.326 --> 00:41:33.956 A:middle
easy it is to add powerful

00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:35.696 A:middle
previewing capabilities to your

00:41:35.696 --> 00:41:37.306 A:middle
application by using the

00:41:37.306 --> 00:41:38.956 A:middle
QLPreviewController of Quick

00:41:38.956 --> 00:41:39.276 A:middle
Look.

00:41:40.276 --> 00:41:42.926 A:middle
Then we have taken a look at

00:41:42.926 --> 00:41:44.316 A:middle
Quick Look's extension points.

00:41:45.196 --> 00:41:47.236 A:middle
Preview extension allows you to

00:41:47.236 --> 00:41:48.876 A:middle
have your custom files preview

00:41:48.876 --> 00:41:50.306 A:middle
by Quick Look just like any

00:41:50.306 --> 00:41:51.386 A:middle
native file type.

00:41:52.396 --> 00:41:54.326 A:middle
While the thumbnail extension is

00:41:54.326 --> 00:41:56.136 A:middle
used to provide thumbnails of

00:41:56.176 --> 00:41:57.976 A:middle
your own file types to iOS when

00:41:57.976 --> 00:41:58.276 A:middle
needed.

00:41:59.086 --> 00:42:01.526 A:middle
Together these extensions make
