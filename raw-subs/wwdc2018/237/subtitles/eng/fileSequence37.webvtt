00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:02.296 A:middle
As mentioned in the presentation

00:37:02.626 --> 00:37:03.796 A:middle
we need to implement this

00:37:03.796 --> 00:37:05.976 A:middle
method, preparePreviewOfFile at

00:37:05.976 --> 00:37:07.166 A:middle
URL completionHandler.

00:37:07.536 --> 00:37:10.506 A:middle
Our main app Particles already

00:37:10.506 --> 00:37:12.316 A:middle
has a view controller class

00:37:12.626 --> 00:37:13.686 A:middle
which [inaudible] the particle

00:37:13.686 --> 00:37:14.526 A:middle
system on screen.

00:37:15.546 --> 00:37:16.866 A:middle
We are going to reduce

00:37:16.866 --> 00:37:17.766 A:middle
[inaudible] controller in our

00:37:17.766 --> 00:37:18.346 A:middle
extension.

00:37:19.406 --> 00:37:21.126 A:middle
We are going to create a helper

00:37:21.126 --> 00:37:22.716 A:middle
method that will take care of

00:37:22.716 --> 00:37:24.176 A:middle
loading such a view controller

00:37:24.366 --> 00:37:25.826 A:middle
and adding it to the view

00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:26.316 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:30.726 A:middle
As you can see present

00:37:30.726 --> 00:37:32.156 A:middle
particleViewController for a

00:37:32.156 --> 00:37:33.656 A:middle
document simply creates a

00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:35.526 A:middle
particleViewController and

00:37:35.526 --> 00:37:37.146 A:middle
passes it to the document it

00:37:37.146 --> 00:37:38.426 A:middle
received so that the

00:37:38.426 --> 00:37:39.806 A:middle
particleViewController can

00:37:39.806 --> 00:37:41.566 A:middle
render the particles that the

00:37:41.566 --> 00:37:42.586 A:middle
document represents.

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:45.426 A:middle
We still need to call this

00:37:45.426 --> 00:37:46.896 A:middle
method from preparePreviewOfFile

00:37:46.896 --> 00:37:50.286 A:middle
at URL, so let's do it.

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:54.136 A:middle
We first create a document that

00:37:54.136 --> 00:37:55.146 A:middle
is a subclass of [inaudible]

00:37:55.226 --> 00:37:56.096 A:middle
document.

00:37:57.136 --> 00:37:59.876 A:middle
We open it and once it is open

00:37:59.876 --> 00:38:01.846 A:middle
and usable we call our helper
