00:19:03.396 --> 00:19:05.796 A:middle
We create a new controller, we

00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:07.426 A:middle
assign the document data source

00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:09.676 A:middle
to it as the data source and

00:19:09.856 --> 00:19:11.446 A:middle
then make sure Quick Look shows

00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:12.936 A:middle
the correct preview when it's

00:19:12.936 --> 00:19:15.016 A:middle
presented by setting the right

00:19:15.116 --> 00:19:15.976 A:middle
CurrentPreviewItemIndex.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:22.316 A:middle
Great, now Xcode is already

00:19:22.316 --> 00:19:23.986 A:middle
complaining about our new code,

00:19:23.986 --> 00:19:25.486 A:middle
it doesn't know

00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:27.106 A:middle
QLPreviewController yet.

00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:29.106 A:middle
We need to import Quick Look

00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:31.396 A:middle
first and therefore we return to

00:19:31.396 --> 00:19:32.666 A:middle
the top of the file and import

00:19:32.716 --> 00:19:32.976 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:19:44.046 --> 00:19:46.456 A:middle
Done. The next thing Xcode

00:19:46.456 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
complains about is the data

00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:48.446 A:middle
source.

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.766 A:middle
The document data source that we

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:52.016 A:middle
assigned to the new preview

00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:53.556 A:middle
controller doesn't seem to

00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:54.416 A:middle
conform to the

00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:56.226 A:middle
QLPreviewController data source

00:19:56.226 --> 00:19:57.946 A:middle
protocol yet which we have

00:19:57.946 --> 00:19:58.946 A:middle
talked about earlier.
