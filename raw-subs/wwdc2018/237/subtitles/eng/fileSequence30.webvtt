00:30:00.376 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
When a new preview has to be

00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:03.066 A:middle
generated for a file type

00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:04.096 A:middle
[inaudible] Quick Look will

00:30:04.776 --> 00:30:06.156 A:middle
create a new

00:30:06.156 --> 00:30:07.986 A:middle
PreviewViewController instance

00:30:08.456 --> 00:30:09.026 A:middle
and calls it

00:30:09.086 --> 00:30:10.636 A:middle
preparePreviewOfFile at URL

00:30:10.636 --> 00:30:12.056 A:middle
completionHandler method.

00:30:14.976 --> 00:30:16.716 A:middle
This method is part of the

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
QLPreviewingController protocol

00:30:19.216 --> 00:30:20.826 A:middle
and is mandatory to provide

00:30:20.826 --> 00:30:22.296 A:middle
previews for a file.

00:30:23.156 --> 00:30:25.296 A:middle
Quick Look will display

00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:26.116 A:middle
[inaudible] while waiting for

00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.486 A:middle
your extension to be ready to

00:30:27.486 --> 00:30:28.266 A:middle
display the preview.

00:30:28.756 --> 00:30:31.026 A:middle
All you have to take care of is

00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:32.116 A:middle
loading the contents of your

00:30:32.116 --> 00:30:34.276 A:middle
preview and calling the

00:30:34.276 --> 00:30:36.196 A:middle
completion handler as soon as

00:30:36.196 --> 00:30:38.886 A:middle
your extension is ready.

00:30:39.026 --> 00:30:40.216 A:middle
All right that's it for the

00:30:40.216 --> 00:30:42.676 A:middle
preview extensions, let's go one

00:30:42.676 --> 00:30:43.216 A:middle
step further.

00:30:44.016 --> 00:30:46.046 A:middle
Similarly to previews you can

00:30:46.046 --> 00:30:47.266 A:middle
also provide thumbnails for

00:30:47.266 --> 00:30:48.926 A:middle
files of your own file format.

00:30:49.316 --> 00:30:51.506 A:middle
Let's talk about Quick Look

00:30:51.506 --> 00:30:52.356 A:middle
thumbnail extensions.

00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:56.776 A:middle
A thumbnail is an image of a

00:30:56.776 --> 00:30:58.806 A:middle
limited size that represents the

00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:00.806 A:middle
contents of a file.
