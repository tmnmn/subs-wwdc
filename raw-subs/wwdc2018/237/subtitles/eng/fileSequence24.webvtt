00:24:12.236 --> 00:24:14.556 A:middle
And now as the last step we

00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:16.446 A:middle
implement the magic method which

00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:18.156 A:middle
tells Quick Look which view to

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:20.176 A:middle
use as the source for the zoom

00:24:20.176 --> 00:24:22.156 A:middle
animation when it is about to be

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:22.756 A:middle
presented.

00:24:34.366 --> 00:24:36.506 A:middle
As you can see, we are using the

00:24:36.506 --> 00:24:38.816 A:middle
image view of the most recently

00:24:38.816 --> 00:24:40.356 A:middle
tapped cell which we keep a

00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:42.356 A:middle
reference of and return it to

00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:42.896 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:24:44.196 --> 00:24:45.646 A:middle
That's literally all we have to

00:24:45.646 --> 00:24:47.316 A:middle
do to make the zoom animation

00:24:47.316 --> 00:24:47.666 A:middle
work.

00:24:48.066 --> 00:24:49.836 A:middle
Quick Look will call this method

00:24:49.836 --> 00:24:51.626 A:middle
when it's presented and when

00:24:51.626 --> 00:24:52.416 A:middle
it's dismissed.

00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:53.916 A:middle
Let's try it out.
