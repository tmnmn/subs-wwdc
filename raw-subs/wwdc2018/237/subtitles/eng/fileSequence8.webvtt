00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:00.886 A:middle
you probably want to use

00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:04.506 A:middle
UAImageView, AVPlayer, WKWebView

00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:06.086 A:middle
or other kind of views instead.

00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:10.316 A:middle
Also note that it's not

00:08:10.316 --> 00:08:12.436 A:middle
supported to customize the view

00:08:12.436 --> 00:08:13.856 A:middle
hierarchy of Quick Look.

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:16.316 A:middle
Please don't try to add views on

00:08:16.316 --> 00:08:17.696 A:middle
top of the previews the

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:20.036 A:middle
navigational toolbar, this is

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:20.976 A:middle
simply not supported.

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:27.826 A:middle
So now that we've introduced

00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:29.596 A:middle
Quick Look, let's take a look at

00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:31.286 A:middle
how to actually make use of our

00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:31.976 A:middle
APIs.

00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:38.655 A:middle
If you want to present documents

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:40.966 A:middle
to the user as a first step you

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.166 A:middle
instantiate a new

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:44.296 A:middle
QLPreviewController which is

00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:46.186 A:middle
basically a UIViewController.

00:08:48.176 --> 00:08:49.726 A:middle
Next, in order to tell the

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:50.886 A:middle
preview controller which

00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:53.006 A:middle
documents to preview, you need

00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:54.726 A:middle
to assign a data source to it.

00:08:55.676 --> 00:08:57.156 A:middle
The data source is an object

00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:58.046 A:middle
that conforms to the

00:08:58.046 --> 00:08:59.986 A:middle
QLPreviewController data source

00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:00.426 A:middle
protocol.
