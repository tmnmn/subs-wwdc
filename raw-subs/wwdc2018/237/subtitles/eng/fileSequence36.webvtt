00:35:59.066 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
implement a preview and a

00:36:00.706 --> 00:36:01.606 A:middle
thumbnail extension.

00:36:02.826 --> 00:36:04.526 A:middle
We already have an existing

00:36:04.526 --> 00:36:06.546 A:middle
project containing the extension

00:36:06.546 --> 00:36:06.926 A:middle
setup.

00:36:07.956 --> 00:36:09.516 A:middle
We are going to use these as a

00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:11.036 A:middle
starting point and add the two

00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:11.736 A:middle
extensions.

00:36:12.556 --> 00:36:14.266 A:middle
As mentioned previously we need

00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:16.326 A:middle
the Info.plist of our extensions

00:36:16.326 --> 00:36:17.936 A:middle
to be configured so that the

00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:19.436 A:middle
system knows we are able to

00:36:19.436 --> 00:36:21.196 A:middle
provide previews and thumbnails

00:36:21.196 --> 00:36:22.316 A:middle
for particles files.

00:36:23.476 --> 00:36:25.786 A:middle
So Particles app defines its own

00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:28.236 A:middle
file format in the exported UTIs

00:36:28.236 --> 00:36:29.576 A:middle
section of the application

00:36:29.576 --> 00:36:30.076 A:middle
target.

00:36:30.936 --> 00:36:32.246 A:middle
We need to configure the

00:36:32.246 --> 00:36:34.256 A:middle
extensions to use that UTI in

00:36:34.256 --> 00:36:35.156 A:middle
the Info.plist.

00:36:35.336 --> 00:36:38.676 A:middle
As you can see the

00:36:38.676 --> 00:36:40.186 A:middle
QLSupportedContentTypes of the

00:36:40.186 --> 00:36:41.376 A:middle
Info.plist of the preview

00:36:41.376 --> 00:36:43.346 A:middle
extension does contain the

00:36:43.346 --> 00:36:44.756 A:middle
identifier of the UTI of the

00:36:44.756 --> 00:36:45.746 A:middle
particles file format.

00:36:46.226 --> 00:36:49.606 A:middle
And this is also the case of the

00:36:49.606 --> 00:36:50.886 A:middle
Info.plist of the thumbnail

00:36:50.886 --> 00:36:51.446 A:middle
extension.

00:36:51.966 --> 00:36:54.256 A:middle
So the only thing left to do is

00:36:54.526 --> 00:36:55.586 A:middle
to actually implement these

00:36:55.586 --> 00:36:56.226 A:middle
extensions.

00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:57.716 A:middle
Let's start with the preview

00:36:57.716 --> 00:36:58.226 A:middle
extension.

00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:02.296 A:middle
As mentioned in the presentation
