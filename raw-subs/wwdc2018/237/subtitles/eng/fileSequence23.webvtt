00:23:05.076 --> 00:23:06.336 A:middle
As you can see, this is a

00:23:06.336 --> 00:23:07.896 A:middle
different style of presenting

00:23:07.896 --> 00:23:09.506 A:middle
Quick Look and it works just as

00:23:09.506 --> 00:23:10.976 A:middle
fine as presenting it modally.

00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:19.226 A:middle
Okay Quick Look works and now

00:23:19.226 --> 00:23:20.356 A:middle
the last thing I would like to

00:23:20.356 --> 00:23:22.126 A:middle
show you is how to use the Quick

00:23:22.126 --> 00:23:23.766 A:middle
Look delegate in order to get a

00:23:23.766 --> 00:23:25.576 A:middle
beautiful zoom animation when

00:23:25.576 --> 00:23:28.616 A:middle
tapping a thumbnail in our grid.

00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:30.456 A:middle
First, we switch back to the

00:23:30.456 --> 00:23:32.286 A:middle
modal presentation style which

00:23:32.286 --> 00:23:33.276 A:middle
is needed for the zoom

00:23:33.276 --> 00:23:33.976 A:middle
transition to work.

00:23:39.046 --> 00:23:40.286 A:middle
Then we need to assign a

00:23:40.286 --> 00:23:41.496 A:middle
delegate to the preview

00:23:41.496 --> 00:23:43.706 A:middle
controller and in this case, we

00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:44.496 A:middle
assign self.

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:55.646 A:middle
However, self doesn't conform to

00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:57.536 A:middle
the QLPreviewController delegate

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.506 A:middle
yet, so let's add it to the list

00:23:59.506 --> 00:23:59.976 A:middle
of protocols.
