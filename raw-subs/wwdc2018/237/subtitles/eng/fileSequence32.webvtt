00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:02.426 A:middle
Thumbnails provided by this

00:32:02.426 --> 00:32:04.906 A:middle
extension appear in the Files

00:32:04.906 --> 00:32:06.416 A:middle
app, as well as in any

00:32:06.416 --> 00:32:07.616 A:middle
UIDocumentBrowswer

00:32:07.616 --> 00:32:09.526 A:middle
ViewController-based app.

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:12.256 A:middle
They also appear in the Quick

00:32:12.256 --> 00:32:14.076 A:middle
Look list, that you can see when

00:32:14.076 --> 00:32:15.746 A:middle
tapping the list button when

00:32:15.746 --> 00:32:17.106 A:middle
previewing multiple files in

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:17.546 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:32:17.546 --> 00:32:20.166 A:middle
If you have custom file types

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:22.136 A:middle
that the user can share and

00:32:22.136 --> 00:32:24.276 A:middle
interact with you will likely

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:25.396 A:middle
want to provide a certain

00:32:25.396 --> 00:32:26.416 A:middle
extension with your app.

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:28.786 A:middle
Let's now see how you can do so.

00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:33.436 A:middle
Creating a thumbnail extension

00:32:33.466 --> 00:32:34.996 A:middle
is as just creating a preview

00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:35.466 A:middle
extension.

00:32:36.856 --> 00:32:39.626 A:middle
To do so add a new target in

00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:40.936 A:middle
your existing application

00:32:40.936 --> 00:32:42.536 A:middle
project and select the Thumbnail

00:32:42.536 --> 00:32:43.986 A:middle
Extension template.

00:32:46.326 --> 00:32:48.226 A:middle
Xcode will generate for you two

00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:50.126 A:middle
files, the ThumbnailProvider

00:32:50.126 --> 00:32:51.316 A:middle
class with a basic

00:32:51.316 --> 00:32:52.046 A:middle
implementation.

00:32:53.326 --> 00:32:54.716 A:middle
This is where you will have to

00:32:54.716 --> 00:32:56.296 A:middle
add the code that takes care of

00:32:56.296 --> 00:32:57.456 A:middle
generating thumbnails.

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.596 A:middle
And an Info.plist this is just
