00:13:59.096 --> 00:14:00.556 A:middle
to assign a delegate at all.

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:04.076 A:middle
The protocol hosts a bunch of

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.506 A:middle
methods you can implement.

00:14:06.306 --> 00:14:07.986 A:middle
The first two methods lets you

00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:09.566 A:middle
react to the event that Quick

00:14:09.566 --> 00:14:11.086 A:middle
Look is about to be dismissed by

00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:13.246 A:middle
the user and also that the

00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:13.976 A:middle
dismissing is now complete.

00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:19.036 A:middle
You might want to use these

00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:20.636 A:middle
methods to update the view

00:14:20.636 --> 00:14:22.126 A:middle
controller that is presenting

00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:22.976 A:middle
Quick Look right now.

00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:29.456 A:middle
Next, the preview controller

00:14:29.456 --> 00:14:31.856 A:middle
should open URL for item method

00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:34.026 A:middle
allows you to prevent Quick Look

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:35.966 A:middle
to follow a link contained in

00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:37.136 A:middle
previewed documents.

00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:39.846 A:middle
With this method you can for

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:41.736 A:middle
example prevent the user from

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.806 A:middle
leaving your app when tapping a

00:14:43.806 --> 00:14:45.886 A:middle
URL or a phone number contained

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:46.206 A:middle
in a PDF.

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:51.086 A:middle
And last but not least, as

00:14:51.086 --> 00:14:52.246 A:middle
promised before the

00:14:52.246 --> 00:14:53.936 A:middle
QLPreviewController delegate

00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:56.356 A:middle
protocol also provides API to

00:14:56.476 --> 00:14:58.896 A:middle
get a smooth zoom animation when

00:14:58.896 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
Quick Look is presented and
