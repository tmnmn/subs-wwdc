00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:00.266 A:middle
and this is the preferred way of

00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:02.416 A:middle
doing it, you use our mode and

00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:04.136 A:middle
method in which you simply

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:05.946 A:middle
return the thumbnail as a view.

00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:08.306 A:middle
With this approach you don't

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:09.916 A:middle
have to worry about coordinates

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:11.306 A:middle
Quick Look will do all the heavy

00:16:11.306 --> 00:16:11.976 A:middle
lifting for you.

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:18.176 A:middle
And this is what it can look

00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
like.

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:21.006 A:middle
Note how the thumbnail

00:16:21.006 --> 00:16:22.916 A:middle
transitions into the full-screen

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:23.896 A:middle
Quick Look preview.

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:27.716 A:middle
All right now it's time for a

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:29.206 A:middle
demo in which we would like to

00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:30.646 A:middle
show you what we've just

00:16:30.646 --> 00:16:31.016 A:middle
covered.

00:16:33.156 --> 00:16:35.666 A:middle
Okay, here's an iOS project and

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:37.226 A:middle
instead of talking about it

00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:38.696 A:middle
let's just press the play button

00:16:38.906 --> 00:16:40.016 A:middle
to see what we've already

00:16:40.016 --> 00:16:41.546 A:middle
prepared and what we are dealing

00:16:41.546 --> 00:16:41.926 A:middle
with here.

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:51.926 A:middle
We are calling this Wildlife

00:16:51.926 --> 00:16:53.766 A:middle
Explorer and it's a very simple

00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:53.976 A:middle
app.

00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:56.516 A:middle
It basically displays a grid of

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.766 A:middle
photos and each of these photos

00:16:58.766 --> 00:17:00.516 A:middle
that we see here acts as a
