00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:00.806 A:middle
contents of a file.

00:31:01.116 --> 00:31:03.206 A:middle
There is throughout iOS and

00:31:03.206 --> 00:31:05.856 A:middle
macOS to allow users to identify

00:31:05.856 --> 00:31:08.216 A:middle
files officially without having

00:31:08.216 --> 00:31:09.316 A:middle
to open them to the file

00:31:09.316 --> 00:31:09.876 A:middle
contents.

00:31:11.366 --> 00:31:12.796 A:middle
For instance you can see on the

00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:15.016 A:middle
screenshot how iOS makes uses of

00:31:15.016 --> 00:31:17.706 A:middle
them in the file tap.

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.326 A:middle
iOS can generate thumbnails for

00:31:19.326 --> 00:31:21.356 A:middle
different file types, images,

00:31:21.356 --> 00:31:24.426 A:middle
videos, PDFs, text files, and

00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:25.266 A:middle
USDZ files.

00:31:26.126 --> 00:31:28.276 A:middle
Now you may have noticed the

00:31:28.276 --> 00:31:29.966 A:middle
blank icons on the left.

00:31:31.186 --> 00:31:32.816 A:middle
This is because these are

00:31:32.956 --> 00:31:35.726 A:middle
particles files and iOS doesn't

00:31:35.726 --> 00:31:37.346 A:middle
know how to generate thumbnails

00:31:37.346 --> 00:31:38.466 A:middle
for this file natively.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:41.786 A:middle
But don't worry we are going to

00:31:41.786 --> 00:31:43.756 A:middle
show you how to create a

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:45.376 A:middle
thumbnail extension that you can

00:31:45.376 --> 00:31:46.746 A:middle
use to improve this situation

00:31:46.746 --> 00:31:47.986 A:middle
for your custom file types

00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:48.296 A:middle
easily.

00:31:49.296 --> 00:31:50.996 A:middle
Look at how great these

00:31:50.996 --> 00:31:52.516 A:middle
thumbnails look for particles

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:54.346 A:middle
files thanks to the thumbnail

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:55.876 A:middle
extension we have added to our

00:31:55.876 --> 00:31:55.976 A:middle
app.
