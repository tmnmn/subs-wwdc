00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:02.096 A:middle
that we have in the number of

00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:03.646 A:middle
preview items in controller

00:11:03.646 --> 00:11:04.086 A:middle
method.

00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:07.626 A:middle
And then each URL respectively

00:11:07.796 --> 00:11:10.006 A:middle
referenced by the index in the

00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:12.216 A:middle
previewController controller

00:11:12.216 --> 00:11:13.896 A:middle
previewItemAt index method.

00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:20.866 A:middle
Okay we've set up our preview

00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:22.426 A:middle
controller and it knows what

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:24.336 A:middle
files to preview, so we are

00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:25.656 A:middle
ready to actually present the

00:11:25.656 --> 00:11:26.376 A:middle
view controller.

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:28.616 A:middle
There are two ways for doing

00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:28.836 A:middle
that.

00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:30.766 A:middle
You can either present the

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:32.496 A:middle
preview controller modally on

00:11:32.496 --> 00:11:34.866 A:middle
top of the current context or

00:11:34.866 --> 00:11:36.456 A:middle
you push the preview controller

00:11:36.916 --> 00:11:38.626 A:middle
into a UINavigationController.

00:11:39.726 --> 00:11:41.746 A:middle
Both ways work great and you

00:11:41.746 --> 00:11:43.646 A:middle
need to decide what fits best in

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:44.586 A:middle
your situation.

00:11:44.586 --> 00:11:47.016 A:middle
To present it modally you do

00:11:47.016 --> 00:11:48.066 A:middle
what you do with any view

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:49.716 A:middle
controller you call present.

00:11:51.666 --> 00:11:53.296 A:middle
Here's an example of what a

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.716 A:middle
modal presentation can look

00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:54.996 A:middle
like.

00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:58.046 A:middle
If you have a

00:11:58.046 --> 00:11:59.876 A:middle
UINavigationController and

00:11:59.876 --> 00:12:01.396 A:middle
prefer to push the preview
