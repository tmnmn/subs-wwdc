00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:01.936 A:middle
For example, when previewing

00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:04.266 A:middle
images you're able to zoom into

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.796 A:middle
the images conveniently.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:26.476 A:middle
And in media files we show a

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:28.176 A:middle
scrubber that allows you to go

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:29.656 A:middle

they are used to from other

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:37.976 A:middle

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:51.136 A:middle
let the users zoom into photos

00:06:51.136 --> 00:06:54.386 A:middle
or you want to be able to flick

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:55.876 A:middle
through a collection of photos

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:56.746 A:middle
