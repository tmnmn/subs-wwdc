00:39:59.506 --> 00:40:01.136 A:middle
Then it takes a snapshot of the

00:40:01.136 --> 00:40:02.666 A:middle
particleViewController and uses

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:05.466 A:middle
it to draw the thumbnail.

00:40:05.506 --> 00:40:06.766 A:middle
We close the document before

00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:08.196 A:middle
returning true to indicate that

00:40:08.196 --> 00:40:09.516 A:middle
we successfully have generated a

00:40:09.516 --> 00:40:09.886 A:middle
thumbnail.

00:40:11.766 --> 00:40:13.116 A:middle
Now that we have [inaudible] to

00:40:13.116 --> 00:40:15.736 A:middle
generate thumbnails we need to

00:40:15.736 --> 00:40:16.736 A:middle
create our [inaudible] reply.

00:40:17.296 --> 00:40:20.476 A:middle
We created out of the context

00:40:20.476 --> 00:40:23.076 A:middle
size, which in this case is the

00:40:23.076 --> 00:40:25.076 A:middle
maximum size and the drawing

00:40:25.076 --> 00:40:25.486 A:middle
block.

00:40:27.516 --> 00:40:29.886 A:middle
Also we have our reply object we

00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:32.346 A:middle
provided through the completion

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:33.356 A:middle
handler [inaudible] parameter,

00:40:33.936 --> 00:40:35.806 A:middle
which in this case is new since

00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:36.946 A:middle
we always add them to draw

00:40:36.946 --> 00:40:38.566 A:middle
thumbnails for particles

00:40:39.676 --> 00:40:40.956 A:middle
documents.

00:40:40.956 --> 00:40:41.926 A:middle
If [inaudible] while drawing it

00:40:42.386 --> 00:40:43.486 A:middle
the thumbnail block success

00:40:43.486 --> 00:40:45.486 A:middle
value will indicate it, so the

00:40:45.486 --> 00:40:46.866 A:middle
thumbnail can be discounted

00:40:47.596 --> 00:40:47.736 A:middle
later.

00:40:48.266 --> 00:40:49.796 A:middle
We are finally all set, let's

00:40:49.796 --> 00:40:50.916 A:middle
run this code and see how this

00:40:50.916 --> 00:40:51.326 A:middle
looks like.

00:40:52.406 --> 00:40:54.726 A:middle
Wow. We now see a beautiful

00:40:54.726 --> 00:40:56.616 A:middle
thumbnail for our fire particles

00:40:56.616 --> 00:40:56.926 A:middle
file.

00:40:57.446 --> 00:40:59.026 A:middle
This looks so much better than

00:40:59.026 --> 00:40:59.386 A:middle
before.
