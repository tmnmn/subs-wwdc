00:16:58.766 --> 00:17:00.516 A:middle
that we see here acts as a

00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:02.276 A:middle
thumbnail for what's behind it

00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:03.126 A:middle
once you tap it.

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.496 A:middle
For example, tapping the

00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:07.286 A:middle
elephant should show a large

00:17:07.286 --> 00:17:08.866 A:middle
photo of the elephant in full

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:11.826 A:middle
screen and tapping the giraffe

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:13.945 A:middle
should preview an entire PDF

00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:15.715 A:middle
about all sorts of giraffes.

00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:18.906 A:middle
Right now we can't do anything

00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:20.445 A:middle
else than just looking at it,

00:17:21.156 --> 00:17:23.126 A:middle
tapping won't do anything yet so

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:23.806 A:middle
let's fix this.

00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:30.406 A:middle
Now this application is fairly

00:17:30.406 --> 00:17:31.376 A:middle
simply structured.

00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:33.916 A:middle
For displaying the grid of

00:17:33.916 --> 00:17:35.166 A:middle
photos we use a

00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:36.356 A:middle
CollectionViewController.

00:17:38.886 --> 00:17:41.686 A:middle
When initializing it we obtain a

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.996 A:middle
list of URLs of documents that

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.656 A:middle
are bundled with the application

00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:46.776 A:middle
like the elephant we've just

00:17:46.776 --> 00:17:46.946 A:middle
seen.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.276 A:middle
We use that list to initialize

00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:54.866 A:middle
what we call a document data

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:55.396 A:middle
source.

00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:58.626 A:middle
This object serves as the model

00:17:58.626 --> 00:17:59.966 A:middle
for the collection view in the

00:17:59.966 --> 00:18:01.296 A:middle
implementation of the
