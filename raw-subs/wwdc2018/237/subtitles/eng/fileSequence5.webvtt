Previewing a zip archive lets

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.586 A:middle
you look into the contents of

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:06.346 A:middle
the archive and view the

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.466 A:middle
contained files individually and

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
share them for example.

00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:13.176 A:middle
Now if your custom file format

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:14.726 A:middle
is missing in this list don't

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:15.136 A:middle
worry.

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:17.786 A:middle
Last year we introduced a new

00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:19.456 A:middle
extension point for implementing

00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:21.046 A:middle
Quick Look preview extensions.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:23.726 A:middle
Preview extensions allow you as

00:05:23.726 --> 00:05:25.886 A:middle
a developer to create a preview

00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:27.746 A:middle
for files of your very own

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:28.876 A:middle
custom file format.

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:31.176 A:middle
We will cover this in the second

00:05:31.176 --> 00:05:31.976 A:middle
part of the session.

00:05:32.476 --> 00:05:35.776 A:middle
And this year with iOS 12 we

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:37.376 A:middle
have also added support for the

00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
new AR file format USDC, so with

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:43.156 A:middle
just a few lines of code you get

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.856 A:middle
a fully immersive augmented

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:46.586 A:middle
reality experience in your

00:05:46.586 --> 00:05:47.276 A:middle
application.

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:50.166 A:middle
Okay, now let's talk about user

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:50.896 A:middle
experience.

00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:53.086 A:middle
For each of the file types shown

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.056 A:middle
before we made sure that Quick

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.606 A:middle
Look provides the best possible

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.866 A:middle
preview on your mobile devices.
