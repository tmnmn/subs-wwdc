00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:00.306 A:middle
in action it's demo time.

00:35:00.806 --> 00:35:03.956 A:middle
Let's start by taking a look at

00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:05.556 A:middle
how things look like after

00:35:05.556 --> 00:35:06.866 A:middle
installing the Particles app

00:35:06.866 --> 00:35:07.986 A:middle
without any Quick Look

00:35:07.986 --> 00:35:08.566 A:middle
extension.

00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:11.466 A:middle
All right we don't have any file

00:35:11.466 --> 00:35:13.686 A:middle
yet, let's create a new one by

00:35:13.686 --> 00:35:15.056 A:middle
pressing the + button.

00:35:17.116 --> 00:35:18.686 A:middle
What you can see here is the

00:35:18.686 --> 00:35:19.686 A:middle
particle editor.

00:35:20.126 --> 00:35:21.786 A:middle
Let's create a file particle

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.946 A:middle
system, we change the color a

00:35:23.946 --> 00:35:25.426 A:middle
bit, and save the document.

00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:30.336 A:middle
Well as you can see we don't get

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:31.716 A:middle
to see the beautiful particle

00:35:31.716 --> 00:35:33.046 A:middle
system we just designed.

00:35:33.406 --> 00:35:35.716 A:middle
[Inaudible] of that by adding a

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:37.126 A:middle
thumbnail extension to our

00:35:37.126 --> 00:35:37.716 A:middle
application.

00:35:38.476 --> 00:35:40.586 A:middle
Now let's save the file to a

00:35:41.076 --> 00:35:41.966 A:middle
[inaudible] and see how the

00:35:41.966 --> 00:35:44.046 A:middle
preview looks like in Quick

00:35:46.816 --> 00:35:46.916 A:middle
Look.

00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:49.436 A:middle
All right let's open the file

00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:50.056 A:middle
format.

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.746 A:middle
All we see is a blank screen, we

00:35:54.746 --> 00:35:56.246 A:middle
can do better, let's improve

00:35:56.246 --> 00:35:56.626 A:middle
this too.

00:35:57.556 --> 00:35:59.066 A:middle
Let's switch to Xcode and

00:35:59.066 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
implement a preview and a
