00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
However, since iOS 11 this list

00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:04.836 A:middle
can be extended by bundling a

00:26:04.836 --> 00:26:06.646 A:middle
preview extension with your iOS

00:26:06.646 --> 00:26:08.886 A:middle
app which allows you as a

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:10.876 A:middle
developer to provide previews

00:26:10.876 --> 00:26:12.326 A:middle
for your custom file formats.

00:26:12.636 --> 00:26:15.666 A:middle
You should provide a preview if

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:16.886 A:middle
you're in a custom fil format

00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:18.536 A:middle
and you'd like this one to be

00:26:18.536 --> 00:26:20.436 A:middle
previewed by Quick Look just

00:26:20.436 --> 00:26:22.466 A:middle
like any other native type.

00:26:23.656 --> 00:26:25.146 A:middle
File types that are meant to be

00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:27.126 A:middle
shared are usually good types to

00:26:27.126 --> 00:26:28.656 A:middle
create an extension for,

00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:31.046 A:middle
especially if you want your

00:26:31.046 --> 00:26:32.886 A:middle
users to preview the content

00:26:32.936 --> 00:26:35.106 A:middle
easily after receiving a file in

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:37.516 A:middle
an app like Mail, Messages or in

00:26:37.516 --> 00:26:38.256 A:middle
a Note for instance.

00:26:38.766 --> 00:26:40.536 A:middle
And then everything works

00:26:40.536 --> 00:26:43.176 A:middle
together and your application

00:26:43.176 --> 00:26:44.096 A:middle
that is using a

00:26:44.096 --> 00:26:45.896 A:middle
QLPreviewController with a file

00:26:46.196 --> 00:26:48.026 A:middle
that is not natively supported

00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:49.806 A:middle
will benefit from your preview

00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:50.326 A:middle
extension.

00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:54.796 A:middle
Here is an example of what you

00:26:54.796 --> 00:26:56.456 A:middle
can achieve thanks to a preview

00:26:56.456 --> 00:26:56.916 A:middle
extension.

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.876 A:middle
We have built a sample app that

00:26:59.876 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
can be downloaded from Apple's
