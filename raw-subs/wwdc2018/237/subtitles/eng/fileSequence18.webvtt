00:17:59.966 --> 00:18:01.296 A:middle
implementation of the

00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:03.506 A:middle
UICollectionViewDataSource

00:18:03.506 --> 00:18:03.976 A:middle
protocol.

00:18:12.106 --> 00:18:13.896 A:middle
Here we return the number of

00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:15.696 A:middle
documents we have just gathered

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.896 A:middle
and then create a cell for each

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.316 A:middle
of the documents with a

00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:20.896 A:middle
thumbnail as the image of the

00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:22.076 A:middle
cell respectively.

00:18:22.526 --> 00:18:25.756 A:middle
And that's pretty much the core

00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:27.166 A:middle
of the application so far.

00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:29.736 A:middle
Now let's add what we've talked

00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:30.476 A:middle
about before.

00:18:31.216 --> 00:18:32.786 A:middle
When tapping a cell we would

00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:34.246 A:middle
like to show Quick Look with the

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.146 A:middle
right document.

00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.886 A:middle
We've already made sure that we

00:18:37.886 --> 00:18:39.196 A:middle
have a method that is called

00:18:39.196 --> 00:18:40.856 A:middle
when the user has just tapped a

00:18:40.856 --> 00:18:40.966 A:middle
cell.

00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:48.676 A:middle
To show Quick Look we create a

00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:50.896 A:middle
new QLPreviewController in here

00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:51.976 A:middle
and configure it.
