00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.596 A:middle
And an Info.plist this is just

00:33:00.596 --> 00:33:01.806 A:middle
like for the preview extension,

00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:03.856 A:middle
the first thing you will have to

00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:05.266 A:middle
edit after creating your

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:05.796 A:middle
extension.

00:33:10.046 --> 00:33:11.296 A:middle
As in the Info.plist of the

00:33:11.296 --> 00:33:12.926 A:middle
preview extensions the

00:33:12.926 --> 00:33:14.096 A:middle
Info.plist of the thumbnail

00:33:14.096 --> 00:33:15.406 A:middle
extensions have a

00:33:15.406 --> 00:33:17.326 A:middle
QLSupportedContentTypes array

00:33:17.936 --> 00:33:19.336 A:middle
that needs to be filled with the

00:33:19.336 --> 00:33:20.766 A:middle
content types that your

00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:23.096 A:middle
extension supports.

00:33:24.096 --> 00:33:26.866 A:middle
So make sure to include in

00:33:26.866 --> 00:33:29.086 A:middle
QLSupportedContentTypes all the

00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:30.756 A:middle
content types for which your

00:33:30.756 --> 00:33:32.076 A:middle
extension can generate

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:32.626 A:middle
thumbnails.

00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:35.646 A:middle
After setting up your extension

00:33:35.836 --> 00:33:37.466 A:middle
you will be able to start

00:33:37.466 --> 00:33:38.336 A:middle
implementing your

00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:40.206 A:middle
QLThumbnailProvider subclass.

00:33:40.596 --> 00:33:42.506 A:middle
You have two ways to provide a

00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:44.976 A:middle
thumbnail for a file.

00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:46.396 A:middle
You can [inaudible] use it

00:33:46.936 --> 00:33:49.336 A:middle
CoreGraphics or UIKit

00:33:49.336 --> 00:33:52.266 A:middle
[inaudible] techniques or you

00:33:52.266 --> 00:33:54.286 A:middle
can return an image file URL.

00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:59.296 A:middle
You will have to override the

00:33:59.296 --> 00:34:00.866 A:middle
provideThumbnail for request
