00:25:03.046 --> 00:25:04.506 A:middle
Now when we tap a thumbnail

00:25:05.116 --> 00:25:06.576 A:middle
notice how the thumbnail is

00:25:06.576 --> 00:25:07.976 A:middle
animating to the full-screen

00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:08.446 A:middle
preview.

00:25:09.756 --> 00:25:11.646 A:middle
Also observe no matter how we

00:25:11.646 --> 00:25:13.726 A:middle
dismiss the preview it

00:25:13.766 --> 00:25:15.406 A:middle
beautifully transitions back to

00:25:15.406 --> 00:25:15.946 A:middle
the right origin.

00:25:22.306 --> 00:25:24.586 A:middle
Great, that's it for the demo,

00:25:25.206 --> 00:25:26.106 A:middle
back to the slides.

00:25:26.616 --> 00:25:28.116 A:middle
And now I would like to hand it

00:25:28.116 --> 00:25:30.036 A:middle
over to Maxime who is going to

00:25:30.036 --> 00:25:31.996 A:middle
tell you all about previews and

00:25:31.996 --> 00:25:33.076 A:middle
thumbnail extensions.

00:25:34.336 --> 00:25:35.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Raffael.

00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:37.916 A:middle
So as you have seen, Quick Look

00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:39.486 A:middle
makes it super easy to add a

00:25:39.486 --> 00:25:41.036 A:middle
powerful previewing feature to

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:41.506 A:middle
your app.

00:25:42.196 --> 00:25:43.756 A:middle
But there is more to talk about.

00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:45.556 A:middle
The first thing I want to show

00:25:45.556 --> 00:25:47.326 A:middle
you is how to extend Quick

00:25:47.326 --> 00:25:48.826 A:middle
Look's previewing capabilities

00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:50.766 A:middle
by providing a preview for your

00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:51.676 A:middle
own file format.

00:25:54.006 --> 00:25:55.476 A:middle
We have listed the file types

00:25:55.476 --> 00:25:56.636 A:middle
that Quick Look supports

00:25:56.636 --> 00:25:57.536 A:middle
natively before.

00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:02.936 A:middle
However, since iOS 11 this list
