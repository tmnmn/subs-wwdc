00:11:59.876 --> 00:12:01.396 A:middle
prefer to push the preview

00:12:01.396 --> 00:12:03.386 A:middle
controller instead you use

00:12:03.386 --> 00:12:03.976 A:middle
pushViewController.

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:08.976 A:middle
This is what it looks like.

00:12:16.046 --> 00:12:17.286 A:middle
The QLPreviewController class

00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:18.866 A:middle
provides a few more methods that

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:19.906 A:middle
I would like to highlight.

00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:22.826 A:middle
First, if you want to know if

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:24.296 A:middle
Quick Look is capable of

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:25.986 A:middle
previewing a certain document

00:12:26.706 --> 00:12:28.756 A:middle
use the canPreview item class

00:12:28.756 --> 00:12:32.026 A:middle
method, this will return true if

00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:33.726 A:middle
the document matches any of the

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:36.376 A:middle
supported default file types or

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:37.756 A:middle
if there is a preview extension

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:39.226 A:middle
available that can handle the

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:39.666 A:middle
file.

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:43.766 A:middle
The data source we've already

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:44.216 A:middle
covered.

00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:49.216 A:middle
Reload data reloads the list of

00:12:49.216 --> 00:12:50.356 A:middle
documents your preview

00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:51.556 A:middle
controller should present.

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:54.406 A:middle
If this list ever changes while

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.486 A:middle
the preview controller is

00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:57.626 A:middle
currently presented use this

00:12:57.626 --> 00:12:59.236 A:middle
method to trigger a reload.
