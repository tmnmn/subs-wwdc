00:26:59.876 --> 00:27:01.386 A:middle
can be downloaded from Apple's

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:02.956 A:middle
website that allows one to

00:27:02.956 --> 00:27:05.316 A:middle
create customized and interact

00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:05.936 A:middle
with Particles.

00:27:07.086 --> 00:27:08.406 A:middle
Since we wanted to share our

00:27:08.406 --> 00:27:11.286 A:middle
cool Particles to other users we

00:27:11.286 --> 00:27:13.956 A:middle
created a new file format, the

00:27:13.956 --> 00:27:16.636 A:middle
particles file format.

00:27:16.636 --> 00:27:18.076 A:middle
Each file represents a particle

00:27:18.076 --> 00:27:20.316 A:middle
system and you can configure all

00:27:20.316 --> 00:27:22.856 A:middle
sorts of [inaudible] systems.

00:27:24.466 --> 00:27:26.956 A:middle
Now let's say you share a

00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:28.706 A:middle
particles file with your

00:27:28.706 --> 00:27:29.146 A:middle
friends.

00:27:30.026 --> 00:27:31.656 A:middle
When previewing them in messages

00:27:31.786 --> 00:27:33.106 A:middle
or as an email attachment for

00:27:33.106 --> 00:27:34.906 A:middle
instance [inaudible] get to see

00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:36.996 A:middle
is a blank screen, that is

00:27:36.996 --> 00:27:40.256 A:middle
certainly not what we want.

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:42.176 A:middle
But by implementing your preview

00:27:42.176 --> 00:27:43.696 A:middle
extension for our particles file

00:27:43.696 --> 00:27:45.196 A:middle
format it will replace that

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.476 A:middle
blank screen with a beautifully

00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:47.926 A:middle
rendered three-dimensional

00:27:48.236 --> 00:27:49.586 A:middle
interactive particle system.

00:27:49.586 --> 00:27:49.976 A:middle
How good is that?

00:27:54.046 --> 00:27:55.136 A:middle
I am sure you now want to learn

00:27:55.346 --> 00:27:56.546 A:middle
how you can make your own

00:27:56.546 --> 00:27:58.016 A:middle
preview extension for your file

00:27:58.016 --> 00:27:58.586 A:middle
formats.
