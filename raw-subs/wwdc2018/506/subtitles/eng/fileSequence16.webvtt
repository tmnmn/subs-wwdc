00:16:00.716 --> 00:16:01.476 A:middle
you can start playback.

00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:03.626 A:middle
You do this using the setQueue

00:16:03.626 --> 00:16:03.996 A:middle
method.

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.576 A:middle
Here we're supplying the idea of

00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:07.926 A:middle
an album, and MusicKit will

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.286 A:middle
handle fetching the metadata and

00:16:10.286 --> 00:16:11.206 A:middle
then setting that queue.

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.496 A:middle
If you have a content object

00:16:13.496 --> 00:16:15.206 A:middle
that we saw previously, you can

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:16.526 A:middle
pass that in directly, and it

00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:19.946 A:middle
will figure out what to do.

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:21.176 A:middle
setQueue returns a promise.

00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.276 A:middle
When the queue is fully loaded,

00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:24.206 A:middle
you can start playback.

00:16:24.256 --> 00:16:24.966 A:middle
Here we're going to start

00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:26.556 A:middle
playback automatically with

00:16:26.556 --> 00:16:30.996 A:middle
music.play.

00:16:31.206 --> 00:16:32.176 A:middle
Once those songs are playing,

00:16:32.176 --> 00:16:33.246 A:middle
you might want to be able to

00:16:33.246 --> 00:16:34.616 A:middle
control that.

00:16:34.616 --> 00:16:36.356 A:middle
You can skip to the next or

00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:37.106 A:middle
previous item.

00:16:37.146 --> 00:16:38.000 A:middle
You can pause.

00:16:42.406 --> 00:16:44.056 A:middle
You can present actions in your

00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:46.016 A:middle
UI that will let a user quickly

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:47.196 A:middle
add those songs, albums, or

00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:49.056 A:middle
playlists they're browsing to

00:16:49.056 --> 00:16:50.366 A:middle
their own iCloud Music Library.

00:16:51.236 --> 00:16:52.746 A:middle
We have an addToLibrary method

00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:52.986 A:middle
here.

00:16:52.986 --> 00:16:58.646 A:middle
You can do that same, you can do

00:16:58.646 --> 00:17:00.216 A:middle
those same 3 calls in batch.
