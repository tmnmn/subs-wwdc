00:20:00.706 --> 00:20:02.846 A:middle
And we'll notice that our markup

00:20:02.846 --> 00:20:04.446 A:middle
looks a little weird on the

00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:05.346 A:middle
left-hand side.

00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:06.926 A:middle
We got a couple of buttons that

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:09.486 A:middle
are magically floating, and the

00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:10.826 A:middle
artwork is obviously empty.

00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:15.106 A:middle
And this is because MusicKit JS

00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:16.756 A:middle
assumes that if you're

00:20:16.756 --> 00:20:18.456 A:middle
configuring it with the meta

00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:20.066 A:middle
tags, that you want declarative

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:20.886 A:middle
markup enabled.

00:20:21.246 --> 00:20:22.256 A:middle
When you don't provide that

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:24.156 A:middle
configuration, it assumes you're

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.776 A:middle
running JavaScript and you don't

00:20:25.776 --> 00:20:26.756 A:middle
want declarative markup.

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:28.856 A:middle
But we provide a hook for you to

00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:30.146 A:middle
re-enable that with JavaScript.

00:20:30.616 --> 00:20:35.486 A:middle
We can configure MusicKit JS by

00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:36.956 A:middle
listening to the MusicKit loaded

00:20:36.956 --> 00:20:37.946 A:middle
event that's fired on the

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:38.456 A:middle
document.

00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:40.646 A:middle
This lets us know that MusicKit

00:20:40.646 --> 00:20:42.016 A:middle
JS is ready to be used and

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:43.716 A:middle
configured and playback can

00:20:43.716 --> 00:20:44.076 A:middle
happen.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.926 A:middle
We can configure our application

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.166 A:middle
name just like we did with the

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:49.986 A:middle
meta tags, but we now have an

00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:50.806 A:middle
attribute that says

00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:52.226 A:middle
declarativeMarkup that we can

00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:54.756 A:middle
set to true, which lets MusicKit

00:20:54.756 --> 00:20:55.916 A:middle
JS know that we're running in a

00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:57.276 A:middle
mixed mode and we want those

00:20:57.276 --> 00:20:58.526 A:middle
declarative markup features to

00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:00.000 A:middle
be enabled.
