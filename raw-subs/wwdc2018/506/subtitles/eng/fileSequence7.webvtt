00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.296 A:middle
You can generate this using your

00:07:00.296 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
private key.

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:05.466 A:middle
We have a really great way to

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:07.606 A:middle
use declarative HTML markup.

00:07:07.796 --> 00:07:08.696 A:middle
You can add some markup to your

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:09.156 A:middle
page.

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:10.636 A:middle
For example, buttons for sign

00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:11.906 A:middle
in, sign out, or playback

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:12.376 A:middle
controls.

00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:15.236 A:middle
We'll handle wiring up those

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:16.866 A:middle
elements to the appropriate

00:07:16.866 --> 00:07:17.856 A:middle
functions in MusicKit.

00:07:18.346 --> 00:07:20.366 A:middle
Then, we're going to add some

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:21.026 A:middle
play buttons.

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:22.596 A:middle
We'll use some content IDs or

00:07:22.596 --> 00:07:24.456 A:middle
some URLs from the Apple Music

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:26.236 A:middle
catalog that'll let the users

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:26.876 A:middle
start playback.

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:31.446 A:middle
So let's take a look at the code

00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:31.716 A:middle
for this.

00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:33.476 A:middle
You're going to include the

00:07:33.476 --> 00:07:34.926 A:middle
JavaScript library, and we're

00:07:34.926 --> 00:07:36.176 A:middle
going to host this on our CDN

00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:36.566 A:middle
for you.

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:39.016 A:middle
We're going to add some buttons

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:41.286 A:middle
for signing in and signing out.

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.656 A:middle
Some buttons to control

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:44.156 A:middle
playback.

00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:45.386 A:middle
Here we have a play button, a

00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:46.766 A:middle
pause button, and a next track

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:46.936 A:middle
button.

00:07:46.936 --> 00:07:50.836 A:middle
We'll add some elements that we

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.286 A:middle
will render in metadata about

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:53.126 A:middle
what's currently playing.

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:54.636 A:middle
Here we can get the playlist

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:56.336 A:middle
name, the title, and the artist

00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:57.046 A:middle
name, for example.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.746 A:middle
And then, we have some elements

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
that let you show the progress
