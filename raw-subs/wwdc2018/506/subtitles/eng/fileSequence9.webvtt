00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:00.136 A:middle
name as well as provide our

00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:01.096 A:middle
developer token.

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:05.936 A:middle
Next, to get the functionality

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:08.396 A:middle
we want, we're going to put a

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:09.776 A:middle
button on the page for the user

00:09:09.776 --> 00:09:10.176 A:middle
to click.

00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:11.356 A:middle
And when this button is clicked,

00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:13.516 A:middle
it's going to take a playlist

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:14.676 A:middle
from the Apple Music catalog,

00:09:15.306 --> 00:09:17.036 A:middle
set a playback queue, and start

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:18.026 A:middle
playback in the browser.

00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:20.746 A:middle
Here I'm feeding a content URL

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:22.256 A:middle
that I got from iTunes on the

00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:24.166 A:middle
desktop for a specific playlist

00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:25.166 A:middle
I'd like to embed.

00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:27.846 A:middle
This playlist is the "Today at

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:29.000 A:middle
Apple Music" playlist.

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:41.016 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:42.836 A:middle
And so with that 1 simple line

00:09:42.836 --> 00:09:44.866 A:middle
of code, we have full playback

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:47.936 A:middle
of the "Today at Apple" playlist

00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:51.776 A:middle
in the browser.

00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:53.436 A:middle
While this is great and it

00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:55.076 A:middle
offers a really good solution,

00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:56.876 A:middle
we probably want to add more

00:09:56.876 --> 00:09:58.146 A:middle
controls and more functionality

00:09:58.146 --> 00:09:59.176 A:middle
for the user to use.
