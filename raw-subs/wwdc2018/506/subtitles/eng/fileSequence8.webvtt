00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.736 A:middle
that let you show the progress

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:02.746 A:middle
through the track that's

00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:04.566 A:middle
currently playing -- the

00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:05.926 A:middle
playback duration, the playback

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.166 A:middle
time, and the playback progress.

00:08:07.656 --> 00:08:10.376 A:middle
So I'd like to bring up Jae Hess

00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:12.166 A:middle
to the stage to show you how to

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:13.866 A:middle
use the MusicKit JS to build

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:15.196 A:middle
that simple player that we just

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:16.856 A:middle
talked about.

00:08:17.516 --> 00:08:20.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:21.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, DJ.

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:24.556 A:middle
So we're going to get started

00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:27.586 A:middle
here, and I have a basic HTML

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:29.106 A:middle
template on the right side in

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:30.746 A:middle
Xcode that's already linked to

00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:32.196 A:middle
the MusicKit JS library.

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:34.586 A:middle
And on the left side, I have a

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:35.966 A:middle
Safari window open that's

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:37.405 A:middle
running a live reload server.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:38.956 A:middle
This way, any changes I make to

00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:40.486 A:middle
my markup will be reflected

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.196 A:middle
directly on the left-hand side.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.996 A:middle
To get started with MusicKit JS,

00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:47.626 A:middle
the first thing we need to do is

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:49.046 A:middle
configure it for our use.

00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:51.076 A:middle
And with declarative markup, we

00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:52.026 A:middle
have a very simple way to do

00:08:52.026 --> 00:08:53.296 A:middle
that using meta tags.

00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:58.266 A:middle
We can specify our application

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:00.136 A:middle
name as well as provide our
