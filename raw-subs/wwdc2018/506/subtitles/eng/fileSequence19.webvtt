00:18:58.936 --> 00:19:00.556 A:middle
also going to use events to

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.356 A:middle
build a simple progress bar.

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:03.716 A:middle
Jae?

00:19:04.526 --> 00:19:05.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, DJ.

00:19:06.516 --> 00:19:11.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:13.996 A:middle
As DJ mentioned, we're going to

00:19:13.996 --> 00:19:15.786 A:middle
take the previous example and

00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:17.186 A:middle
we're going to extend it to add

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.446 A:middle
playlist search.

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:22.116 A:middle
Now, I've taken the, off stage,

00:19:22.116 --> 00:19:23.736 A:middle
I've removed a lot of the stuff

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:24.716 A:middle
that we did from the previous

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:26.046 A:middle
example, but I've left some

00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:27.046 A:middle
things in the page.

00:19:27.336 --> 00:19:29.846 A:middle
I've also included an

00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:31.276 A:middle
application JavaScript file that

00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:32.476 A:middle
we'll be adding our JavaScript

00:19:32.476 --> 00:19:33.806 A:middle
to in a moment, but I wanted to

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.296 A:middle
walk through quickly the HTML

00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:35.556 A:middle
again.

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:38.966 A:middle
The major change we've done is

00:19:38.966 --> 00:19:40.406 A:middle
we've added an input element for

00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:42.896 A:middle
the user to search as well as 2

00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:45.096 A:middle
DOM containers that we can put

00:19:45.096 --> 00:19:46.546 A:middle
those search results into.

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:48.656 A:middle
MusicKit JS doesn't offer an

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:50.336 A:middle
opinion on a library or a

00:19:50.336 --> 00:19:51.476 A:middle
framework that you would be

00:19:51.476 --> 00:19:53.336 A:middle
using with your application, so

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:55.256 A:middle
for this example, our CSS has

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:56.566 A:middle
been prebuilt off screen.

00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.046 A:middle
We have some template helpers

00:19:58.046 --> 00:19:59.036 A:middle
that we've built in a separate

00:19:59.036 --> 00:19:59.786 A:middle
file as well.
