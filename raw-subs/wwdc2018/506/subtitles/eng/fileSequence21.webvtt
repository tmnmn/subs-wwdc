00:21:05.636 --> 00:21:07.266 A:middle
Next, I'm going to add a search

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:07.656 A:middle
handler.

00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:09.566 A:middle
This is straight JavaScript.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:10.966 A:middle
It's not specific to MusicKit

00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:12.056 A:middle
JS, but I did want to walk

00:21:12.056 --> 00:21:13.286 A:middle
through that when the user

00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:15.066 A:middle
presses Enter on the search box

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:16.696 A:middle
is when we're going to fire our

00:21:17.086 --> 00:21:18.506 A:middle
callback to do the search.

00:21:19.046 --> 00:21:23.036 A:middle
And we can implement that by

00:21:23.036 --> 00:21:24.936 A:middle
using the search method off of

00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:26.496 A:middle
MusicKit's API property.

00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:29.286 A:middle
This will perform the search

00:21:29.286 --> 00:21:30.796 A:middle
against the Apple Music API, and

00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:32.976 A:middle
we can specify any query

00:21:32.976 --> 00:21:34.736 A:middle
parameters that the Apple Music

00:21:34.736 --> 00:21:38.186 A:middle
API accepts with a configuration

00:21:38.186 --> 00:21:38.516 A:middle
object.

00:21:39.286 --> 00:21:40.376 A:middle
So we can specify we want to

00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:41.436 A:middle
search, we want to limit the

00:21:41.436 --> 00:21:43.436 A:middle
search to playlists and that we

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:44.796 A:middle
want our results to be limited

00:21:44.796 --> 00:21:45.786 A:middle
to 8.

00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:48.546 A:middle
We have our custom templating,

00:21:49.796 --> 00:21:51.356 A:middle
but I want to highlight these 3

00:21:51.356 --> 00:21:53.186 A:middle
lines, which is where we tell

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:55.966 A:middle
our MusicKit instance to take

00:21:55.966 --> 00:21:57.256 A:middle
the artwork that the user has

00:21:57.256 --> 00:21:59.016 A:middle
clicked on, and we want to set

00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:00.286 A:middle
the playback queue to that
