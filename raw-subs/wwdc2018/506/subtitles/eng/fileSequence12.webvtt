controls, I can pause playback.

00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:03.136 A:middle
I can skip to the next item.

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:09.186 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:12:09.686 --> 00:12:16.606 A:middle
I could even go back to that.

00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:21.076 A:middle
Now, MusicKit JS offers great

00:12:21.076 --> 00:12:22.256 A:middle
solutions with a declarative

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:24.086 A:middle
markup, but it also offers a

00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:26.306 A:middle
full JavaScript API, so I'd like

00:12:26.306 --> 00:12:28.406 A:middle
to bring DJ back up on stage to

00:12:29.046 --> 00:12:30.206 A:middle
go over the JavaScript API with

00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:30.306 A:middle
you.

00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:30.996 A:middle
Thank you.

00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:38.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:38.736 --> 00:12:39.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jae.

00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:43.686 A:middle
The declarative markup is a very

00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:45.946 A:middle
straightforward way to add basic

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
functionality.

00:12:47.436 --> 00:12:48.326 A:middle
Let's talk about some more

00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:49.246 A:middle
advanced usage.

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.836 A:middle
Here we're going to write some

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.016 A:middle
JavaScript to interact with

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:53.646 A:middle
MusicKit, and let's take a look

00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:54.496 A:middle
at a couple examples.

00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:57.516 A:middle
We can fetch metadata from the

00:12:57.516 --> 00:12:58.626 A:middle
catalog by ID.

00:12:59.156 --> 00:13:03.206 A:middle
