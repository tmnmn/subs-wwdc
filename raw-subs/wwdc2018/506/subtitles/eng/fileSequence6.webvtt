00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:01.046 A:middle
you'll be able to play back full

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:02.856 A:middle
songs from Apple Music in the

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:03.246 A:middle
browser.

00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:05.536 A:middle
It works on all modern browsers

00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:06.746 A:middle
without the need for any plug

00:06:06.746 --> 00:06:08.646 A:middle
ins or external dependencies.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.156 A:middle
You can use it on its own or

00:06:11.216 --> 00:06:12.626 A:middle
with any JavaScript framework of

00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:13.066 A:middle
your choice.

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:15.976 A:middle
So for playback, we need to

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:16.856 A:middle
authorize the user.

00:06:18.046 --> 00:06:19.426 A:middle
We'll handle that for you to

00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:20.606 A:middle
ensure that the user is an Apple

00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:21.376 A:middle
Music subscriber.

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:24.066 A:middle
The JavaScript library is going

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:25.326 A:middle
to keep a queue of songs so you

00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:26.756 A:middle
can play back a full album or a

00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:27.336 A:middle
whole playlist.

00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:31.536 A:middle
Once you have that queue of

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:32.486 A:middle
songs, you'll be able to

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:32.866 A:middle
control.

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:34.466 A:middle
You'll be able to play, pause,

00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:36.256 A:middle
and skip to the previous or skip

00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:37.466 A:middle
to the next track.

00:06:38.676 --> 00:06:39.736 A:middle
And we're also going to keep

00:06:39.736 --> 00:06:40.786 A:middle
track of the Now Playing

00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:42.606 A:middle
metadata for the song that's

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:43.916 A:middle
currently playing or currently

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:45.446 A:middle
loading so you can render your

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:47.126 A:middle
UI off of it.

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:49.836 A:middle
So let's talk about how we would

00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:50.896 A:middle
build a simple player for the

00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:51.146 A:middle
web.

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:53.066 A:middle
We're going to include the

00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:54.566 A:middle
JavaScript library.

00:06:56.676 --> 00:06:57.876 A:middle
Then, you need to provide your

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:58.686 A:middle
developer token.

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.296 A:middle
You can generate this using your
