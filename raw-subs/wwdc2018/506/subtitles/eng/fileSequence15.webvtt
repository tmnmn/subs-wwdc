00:14:57.846 --> 00:15:00.066 A:middle
unload more in as the user pages

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.416 A:middle
through or scrolls through your

00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:02.296 A:middle
application.

00:15:02.816 --> 00:15:06.026 A:middle
You could search the Apple Music

00:15:06.026 --> 00:15:06.456 A:middle
catalog.

00:15:07.086 --> 00:15:09.306 A:middle
Here we're going to search for

00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:11.446 A:middle
just songs, and then the second

00:15:11.446 --> 00:15:12.486 A:middle
example, we'll search for both

00:15:12.486 --> 00:15:13.606 A:middle
songs and albums at the same

00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:13.926 A:middle
time.

00:15:14.086 --> 00:15:16.056 A:middle
You can also supply a limit to

00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:17.296 A:middle
limit the number of results

00:15:17.296 --> 00:15:17.666 A:middle
returned.

00:15:18.176 --> 00:15:22.626 A:middle
You can do the same query, but

00:15:22.626 --> 00:15:24.046 A:middle
scope it to within the user's

00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:25.286 A:middle
iCloud Music Library.

00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:27.576 A:middle
Here we're using the exact same

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:28.736 A:middle
search method with the same

00:15:28.736 --> 00:15:30.796 A:middle
parameters, but we're doing it

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.026 A:middle
under the library scope.

00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.466 A:middle
Next up, we have authorization.

00:15:38.596 --> 00:15:39.526 A:middle
We're always going to handle

00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:40.726 A:middle
authorization right before it's

00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:42.496 A:middle
needed -- when playback's

00:15:42.496 --> 00:15:44.096 A:middle
starting or when you're trying

00:15:44.096 --> 00:15:45.886 A:middle
to access the iCloud Music

00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:46.866 A:middle
Library for the current

00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:47.516 A:middle
logged-in user.

00:15:48.996 --> 00:15:49.646 A:middle
You could also trigger it

00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:50.486 A:middle
yourself if you'd like.

00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:52.386 A:middle
Perhaps you want to force that

00:15:52.386 --> 00:15:53.786 A:middle
at the beginning when someone

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:54.586 A:middle
comes to your website.

00:15:58.256 --> 00:15:59.706 A:middle
When the user presses a button,
