00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
Music web player.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.646 A:middle
A few weeks ago, we launched a

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:05.616 A:middle
new embeddable player.

00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:08.306 A:middle
It works great both on the

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:10.176 A:middle
desktop and on mobile browsers.

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:13.496 A:middle
These embeddable players are a

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:15.016 A:middle
simple way for you to add full

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.186 A:middle
song playback from the Apple

00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:17.626 A:middle
Music catalog right to your

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:18.246 A:middle
website.

00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:20.986 A:middle
We have players for a single

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:22.696 A:middle
song, an album, or a whole

00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:23.176 A:middle
playlist.

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:26.346 A:middle
You can find the embed code on

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:28.636 A:middle
the Apple Music preview pages or

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:29.496 A:middle
right within the embeddable

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
player itself.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:32.816 A:middle
All you have to do is copy and

00:05:32.816 --> 00:05:34.156 A:middle
paste into your own website.

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:36.116 A:middle
These embeddable players are

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:38.526 A:middle
great for full song playback on

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:40.036 A:middle
third-party websites, and we've

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.466 A:middle
also enabled that functionality

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.646 A:middle
on the Apple Music preview

00:05:42.646 --> 00:05:43.026 A:middle
pages.

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:47.366 A:middle
So the embeds are powered by

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:49.706 A:middle
MusicKit JS, which we're also

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:50.766 A:middle
releasing so you can build your

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.086 A:middle
own great music experiences.

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:54.696 A:middle
So let's talk about the

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:55.916 A:middle
functionality.

00:05:58.256 --> 00:05:59.936 A:middle
First and most importantly,

00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:01.046 A:middle
you'll be able to play back full
