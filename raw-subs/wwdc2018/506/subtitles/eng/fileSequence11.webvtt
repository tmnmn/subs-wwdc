00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:00.756 A:middle
the current playing item in the

00:11:00.756 --> 00:11:01.086 A:middle
queue.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:03.596 A:middle
And here I've specified the

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.316 A:middle
playlist artwork URL, and I can

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:06.796 A:middle
specify the height and width I

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:07.616 A:middle
would like that to render.

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:09.706 A:middle
And I also have access to any

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:11.196 A:middle
data attribute that's available

00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:11.996 A:middle
on the media item.

00:11:12.646 --> 00:11:14.176 A:middle
So I can specify things like

00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:18.636 A:middle
playlist name, the title of the

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.276 A:middle
track, as well as the artist

00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:20.496 A:middle
name.

00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:22.996 A:middle
Underneath, I've specified that

00:11:22.996 --> 00:11:23.646 A:middle
I would like the current

00:11:23.646 --> 00:11:26.116 A:middle
playback time to be loaded into

00:11:26.116 --> 00:11:28.966 A:middle
the HTML time element.

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:31.376 A:middle
So when the page reloaded,

00:11:31.686 --> 00:11:33.036 A:middle
nothing's there for Now Playing.

00:11:33.036 --> 00:11:33.916 A:middle
That's because we aren't playing

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:35.856 A:middle
anything, so let's fix that by

00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:37.076 A:middle
adding buttons that would allow

00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:39.306 A:middle
the user to queue up playlists.

00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:44.206 A:middle
I'm going to paste in 16

00:11:44.456 --> 00:11:45.026 A:middle
playlists.

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:48.826 A:middle
And when the user--

00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:58.036 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:11:58.536 --> 00:11:59.366 A:middle
Now, using the playback

00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:01.536 A:middle
controls, I can pause playback.
