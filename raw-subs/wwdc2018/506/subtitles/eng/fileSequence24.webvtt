00:23:59.226 --> 00:24:01.126 A:middle
song, we see our custom progress

00:24:01.126 --> 00:24:03.000 A:middle
bar rendering.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.076 A:middle
Now, there's a lot more we could

00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:10.996 A:middle
get into with MusicKit JS, but

00:24:10.996 --> 00:24:12.556 A:middle
I'd like to bring DJ back up to

00:24:12.556 --> 00:24:13.566 A:middle
kind of summarize what we've

00:24:13.566 --> 00:24:15.356 A:middle

&gt;&gt; You can now bring great music

00:24:21.946 --> 00:24:23.226 A:middle
experiences to your websites.

00:24:24.416 --> 00:24:25.386 A:middle
You can use the declarative

00:24:25.386 --> 00:24:27.896 A:middle
markup to quickly add simple

00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:30.736 A:middle
functionality or you can use the

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:32.356 A:middle
JavaScript APIs directly to

00:24:32.356 --> 00:24:33.306 A:middle
build a more advanced

00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:33.856 A:middle
application.

00:24:34.466 --> 00:24:35.926 A:middle
We're looking forward to seeing

00:24:35.926 --> 00:24:36.786 A:middle
what you can build with it.

00:24:37.396 --> 00:24:38.426 A:middle
We have some great documentation

00:24:38.426 --> 00:24:40.936 A:middle
available, and we have a lab

00:24:41.416 --> 00:24:42.196 A:middle
coming up right after this

00:24:42.196 --> 00:24:43.986 A:middle
session in Technology Lab 3.

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:45.766 A:middle
Happy to answer any questions

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:46.666 A:middle
