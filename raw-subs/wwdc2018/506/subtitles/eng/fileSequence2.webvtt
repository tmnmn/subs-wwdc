00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:00.536 A:middle
And lastly, Ola is the biggest

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:02.286 A:middle
ride-hailing service in India.

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
We have been partnering with

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.466 A:middle
them to bring the Apple Music

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:08.705 A:middle
experience within their fleet of

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:09.256 A:middle
cars.

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:13.406 A:middle
Since MusicKit was announced

00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:15.466 A:middle
last year, we got a lot of

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.276 A:middle
feedback for providing a way to

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:20.406 A:middle
look up content using the

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.926 A:middle
International Standard Recording

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.796 A:middle
Code known as ISRC.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:28.336 A:middle
I am happy to report that this

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:30.156 A:middle
has been added, and it will

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:31.986 A:middle
enable you to precisely match

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:35.296 A:middle
songs and music videos in the

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:37.066 A:middle
Apple Music catalog from

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.916 A:middle
virtually any other source.

00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.036 A:middle
Another enhancement to MusicKit

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:45.526 A:middle
is the addition of iCloud Music

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:46.686 A:middle
Library APIs.

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:50.026 A:middle
Once the user has given

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:52.736 A:middle
authorization to your app, you

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.396 A:middle
can now provide them with ways

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:56.486 A:middle
to interact with their music

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:59.206 A:middle
library from within your app.
