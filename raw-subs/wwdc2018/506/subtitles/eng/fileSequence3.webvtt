00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:03.966 A:middle
These APIs enable your users to

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:08.176 A:middle
browse, search, and add content

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:09.506 A:middle
to their music library.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.246 A:middle
You can also provide a way for

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:14.506 A:middle
your user to create playlists

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:16.736 A:middle
and add songs to an existing

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:18.846 A:middle
playlist, all from within your

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:20.000 A:middle
app.

00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:26.146 A:middle
Last year, we gave you Apple

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.366 A:middle
Music APIs for our catalog.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.366 A:middle
This year, we added the iCloud

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.876 A:middle
Music Library APIs.

00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:35.906 A:middle
We think this is a great set of

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:37.276 A:middle
music APIs.

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:40.196 A:middle
If you have been using our

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:42.576 A:middle
existing iTunes Search API, we

00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:44.916 A:middle
encourage you to migrate over to

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:48.126 A:middle
Apple Music APIs now.

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.246 A:middle
Now, I would like to invite my

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:52.466 A:middle
colleague DJ to the stage to

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:53.916 A:middle
talk about Apple Music on the

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:54.216 A:middle
web.

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:55.126 A:middle
Thank you.
