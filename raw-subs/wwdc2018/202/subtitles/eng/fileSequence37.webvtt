00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
access them.

00:37:00.606 --> 00:37:01.866 A:middle
Even better, they can also be

00:37:01.866 --> 00:37:03.456 A:middle
suggested right on the Siri

00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:05.126 A:middle
watch face on Apple Watch.

00:37:06.696 --> 00:37:08.246 A:middle
Now not only are Siri actions

00:37:08.276 --> 00:37:09.916 A:middle
suggested proactively but they

00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:11.236 A:middle
can also be set up to be

00:37:11.236 --> 00:37:13.146 A:middle
executed using a custom voice

00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:13.596 A:middle
phrase.

00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:19.296 A:middle
Now, adding Siri Action Support

00:37:19.296 --> 00:37:21.786 A:middle
to your apps is really easy.

00:37:21.786 --> 00:37:22.946 A:middle
You can use two APIs.

00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:24.826 A:middle
There's NS User Activity, which

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:26.306 A:middle
you may already be using for

00:37:26.306 --> 00:37:28.916 A:middle
support for Handoff and

00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:29.886 A:middle
Spotlight integration, and

00:37:30.356 --> 00:37:32.016 A:middle
there's also support for Siri

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.346 A:middle
Intents for more complex

00:37:33.396 --> 00:37:35.316 A:middle
scenarios where you have more

00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:36.246 A:middle
custom interactions.

00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:38.156 A:middle
So let's look first at NS User

00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:38.606 A:middle
Activity.

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:40.466 A:middle
Now as I mentioned, NS User

00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:42.056 A:middle
Activity is a common API with

00:37:42.056 --> 00:37:43.856 A:middle
Handoff and Spotlight and this

00:37:43.856 --> 00:37:45.116 A:middle
could be a really great API to

00:37:45.116 --> 00:37:46.826 A:middle
use if your Siri Shortcuts

00:37:46.826 --> 00:37:48.416 A:middle
should get your customers back

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:50.116 A:middle
to a specific place in your app,

00:37:50.316 --> 00:37:51.516 A:middle
for example loading a particular

00:37:51.516 --> 00:37:54.226 A:middle
message or document, the same as

00:37:54.226 --> 00:37:55.056 A:middle
you would do if you were trying

00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:55.986 A:middle
to hand that off to another

00:37:55.986 --> 00:37:56.516 A:middle
device.

00:37:57.176 --> 00:37:58.706 A:middle
If you're already doing this,

00:37:58.806 --> 00:38:00.336 A:middle
it's really easy to add support
