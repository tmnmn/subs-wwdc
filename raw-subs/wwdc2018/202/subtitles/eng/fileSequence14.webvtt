00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:00.036 A:middle
these larger requests or just

00:14:00.036 --> 00:14:01.376 A:middle
reduce those overall peak

00:14:01.376 --> 00:14:03.376 A:middle
demands can actually have both a

00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:05.186 A:middle
big impact on the performance of

00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:07.236 A:middle
your app while you're using it

00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:08.816 A:middle
and also improve the customer

00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:10.366 A:middle
experience across other apps

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:10.716 A:middle
later.

00:14:12.716 --> 00:14:14.006 A:middle
So there's many ways that you

00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:16.186 A:middle
can reduce the total memory

00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.806 A:middle
usage of your apps and starting

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:19.146 A:middle
with a profile and instruments

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:20.326 A:middle
is a great way to look at that.

00:14:20.746 --> 00:14:21.886 A:middle
But for this morning, we're just

00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:23.496 A:middle
going to take a look at one new

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:25.306 A:middle
technique that iOS 12 brings

00:14:25.306 --> 00:14:26.666 A:middle
along that helps reduce the

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:29.216 A:middle
memory usage of your apps and

00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:30.786 A:middle
that's Automatic Backing Stores.

00:14:31.856 --> 00:14:32.966 A:middle
So let's say we want to draw

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.616 A:middle
this lazy prairie dog in

00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.356 A:middle
portrait mode on an iPhone X.

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:38.826 A:middle
Now, how big is that going to

00:14:38.826 --> 00:14:38.893 A:middle
be?

00:14:39.436 --> 00:14:41.666 A:middle
Portrait mode on iPhone X, 375

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.376 A:middle
points wide and, to preserve our

00:14:43.376 --> 00:14:45.346 A:middle
aspect ratio, it'll be 250

00:14:45.346 --> 00:14:46.176 A:middle
points tall.

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:48.646 A:middle
So how much memory will that

00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:48.896 A:middle
use?

00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:54.956 A:middle
Well, 375 by 250 at 3x, with 64

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:56.346 A:middle
bits per pixel because this is a

00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:58.226 A:middle
deep color device, is going to

00:14:58.226 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
be 2.2 megabytes of memory to
