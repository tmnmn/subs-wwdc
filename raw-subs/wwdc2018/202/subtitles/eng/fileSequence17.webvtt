00:16:58.896 --> 00:17:00.086 A:middle
that you get out at the end.

00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:02.516 A:middle
So in cases where you actually

00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:03.866 A:middle
know that the automatic behavior

00:17:03.866 --> 00:17:05.675 A:middle
is not what you want, from Image

00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:07.146 A:middle
Renderer, you can specify the

00:17:07.146 --> 00:17:09.106 A:middle
specific backing store style

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:10.636 A:middle
that you want, for example using

00:17:10.636 --> 00:17:12.386 A:middle
the new Range API to specify

00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:13.915 A:middle
specifically that you want an

00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:15.306 A:middle
extended-range image.

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:17.626 A:middle
Now you can learn all about this

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:20.306 A:middle
and many more techniques around

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.205 A:middle
UI Image in the Images and

00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:23.796 A:middle
Graphics Best Practices Session

00:17:23.796 --> 00:17:24.455 A:middle
later this week.

00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:27.205 A:middle
So that's our second top for

00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:27.656 A:middle
performance.

00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:30.266 A:middle
Next, let's move on to Auto

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:30.636 A:middle
Layout.

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:34.766 A:middle
Now Auto Layout in iOS 10 has

00:17:34.986 --> 00:17:36.386 A:middle
some really great improvements.

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:37.946 A:middle
The team has been working

00:17:37.946 --> 00:17:40.076 A:middle
incredibly hard to optimize Auto

00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:41.586 A:middle
Layout for your apps as much as

00:17:41.626 --> 00:17:42.076 A:middle
possible.

00:17:42.676 --> 00:17:44.726 A:middle
So you'll find that Auto Layout

00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:46.856 A:middle
is now faster by default in iOS

00:17:46.856 --> 00:17:47.146 A:middle
12.

00:17:47.556 --> 00:17:48.306 A:middle
We'll talk about a number of

00:17:48.306 --> 00:17:49.096 A:middle
ways that's the case.

00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:52.016 A:middle
But while they were profiling

00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:53.406 A:middle
and optimizing Auto Layout, they

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.866 A:middle
also were looking across the

00:17:54.946 --> 00:17:56.476 A:middle
system at many of our own apps

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:57.896 A:middle
and how they were using Auto

00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:59.686 A:middle
Layout and they found a number

00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:00.726 A:middle
of cases where there were some
