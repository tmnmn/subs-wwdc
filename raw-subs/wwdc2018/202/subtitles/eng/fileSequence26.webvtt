00:25:58.296 --> 00:26:00.106 A:middle
don't have to do any additional

00:26:00.106 --> 00:26:00.706 A:middle
conversion.

00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:03.246 A:middle
The built-in introspection of

00:26:03.246 --> 00:26:04.356 A:middle
the types can allow you to print

00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:04.916 A:middle
them directly.

00:26:05.226 --> 00:26:06.396 A:middle
So in Swift 4.2, you just

00:26:06.396 --> 00:26:07.486 A:middle
actually pass these types

00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:08.726 A:middle
directly to your print functions

00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:10.416 A:middle
if you want to print them out

00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:12.056 A:middle
for debug purposes or log them.

00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:14.186 A:middle
And then finally, you may

00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:15.786 A:middle
already have some existing code

00:26:15.786 --> 00:26:17.196 A:middle
that was using the behavior of

00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:18.826 A:middle
the old string conversion

00:26:18.826 --> 00:26:20.986 A:middle
functions and need a compatible

00:26:20.986 --> 00:26:22.766 A:middle
functionality going forward.

00:26:23.366 --> 00:26:24.346 A:middle
And so for that we've actually

00:26:24.346 --> 00:26:25.476 A:middle
just renamed all of these and

00:26:25.476 --> 00:26:27.326 A:middle
moved them to be properties on

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:28.126 A:middle
NSCoder.

00:26:28.526 --> 00:26:29.826 A:middle
This really helps to emphasize

00:26:29.826 --> 00:26:30.926 A:middle
the fact that the intent of

00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:32.516 A:middle
these methods was to be used for

00:26:32.516 --> 00:26:34.276 A:middle
encoding and decoding, so it's a

00:26:34.276 --> 00:26:35.476 A:middle
pretty natural fit for them to

00:26:35.476 --> 00:26:36.066 A:middle
go over there.

00:26:37.966 --> 00:26:39.476 A:middle
So these are just a few of the

00:26:39.476 --> 00:26:40.666 A:middle
consistency improvements that

00:26:40.666 --> 00:26:43.106 A:middle
you'll find across the iOS 12

00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:46.946 A:middle
SDK for Swift 4.2 but you'll

00:26:46.946 --> 00:26:48.056 A:middle
find many more as well.

00:26:49.476 --> 00:26:51.176 A:middle
Now speaking of encoding and

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:54.246 A:middle
decoding, NS Secure Coding, in

00:26:55.096 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
iOS 12 there are now new secure

00:26:57.566 --> 00:26:59.456 A:middle
by default encoding and decoding

00:26:59.456 --> 00:26:59.856 A:middle
APIs.
