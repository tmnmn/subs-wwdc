00:22:57.546 --> 00:23:00.286 A:middle
help improve understandability

00:23:00.286 --> 00:23:02.246 A:middle
and remove some confusion.

00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:03.546 A:middle
So in this case, let's look at

00:23:03.546 --> 00:23:05.016 A:middle
UI Tab Bar Item Positioning.

00:23:05.626 --> 00:23:06.216 A:middle
Now do you think that's

00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:09.086 A:middle
UITabBarItemPositioning or

00:23:09.226 --> 00:23:10.896 A:middle
UITabBarItem Positioning?

00:23:10.896 --> 00:23:12.586 A:middle
It could actually be either.

00:23:12.836 --> 00:23:13.906 A:middle
Those are both classes.

00:23:14.406 --> 00:23:16.546 A:middle
And in Swift 42, it is now

00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:17.726 A:middle
perfectly clear that it is, in

00:23:17.726 --> 00:23:20.066 A:middle
fact, UITabBar ItemPositioning.

00:23:20.646 --> 00:23:23.226 A:middle
So in addition to nested types,

00:23:23.546 --> 00:23:25.036 A:middle
we've also nested a bunch of

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:25.666 A:middle
constants.

00:23:26.106 --> 00:23:27.486 A:middle
So if we look here at Swift 4,

00:23:27.486 --> 00:23:29.926 A:middle
we had NS notifications were all

00:23:29.926 --> 00:23:30.636 A:middle
in the global

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:32.796 A:middle
NSNotification.Name namespace

00:23:33.206 --> 00:23:34.616 A:middle
and their associated user info

00:23:34.616 --> 00:23:35.956 A:middle
keys were actually just global

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.206 A:middle
constants that were floating out

00:23:37.206 --> 00:23:37.386 A:middle
there.

00:23:38.026 --> 00:23:39.676 A:middle
So for consistency with AppKit

00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:41.146 A:middle
and to make it easier to find

00:23:41.146 --> 00:23:42.656 A:middle
and associate these types

00:23:42.706 --> 00:23:44.196 A:middle
together, they've now all been

00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:45.436 A:middle
nested under the class that

00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:46.026 A:middle
they're used with.

00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:47.426 A:middle
So something like did Change

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.006 A:middle
Status Bar Orientation is now

00:23:49.316 --> 00:23:51.336 A:middle
under UI Application did Change

00:23:51.336 --> 00:23:52.346 A:middle
Status Bar Orientation

00:23:52.346 --> 00:23:54.106 A:middle
Notification and its user info

00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:55.436 A:middle
key moved along with it so that

00:23:55.436 --> 00:23:56.486 A:middle
they're all co-located.

00:23:57.126 --> 00:23:59.656 A:middle
Now we've also audited all of

00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:01.326 A:middle
the other global constants all
