00:07:58.016 --> 00:08:00.086 A:middle
kept profiling our apps and we

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:01.846 A:middle
actually found another case

00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:02.756 A:middle
where there was a bit of a

00:08:02.756 --> 00:08:04.236 A:middle
surprising cause of some dropped

00:08:04.236 --> 00:08:04.676 A:middle
frames.

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:07.316 A:middle
Now what we found was that when

00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:09.096 A:middle
the device was not under load,

00:08:09.396 --> 00:08:10.276 A:middle
there was no background

00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:12.016 A:middle
activity, all we were doing was

00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:13.056 A:middle
a little bit of scrolling in the

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:13.726 A:middle
foreground app.

00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:15.916 A:middle
Counterintuitively, we could

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:18.336 A:middle
actually drop more frames than

00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:19.896 A:middle
times when there was some small

00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:21.226 A:middle
amount of light background work

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:21.766 A:middle
going on.

00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:23.536 A:middle
That didn't really make a lot of

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:23.866 A:middle
sense.

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:25.636 A:middle
And to understand why it was

00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:27.306 A:middle
happening, we had to drop down a

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.126 A:middle
level and take a look at the

00:08:29.126 --> 00:08:31.736 A:middle
behavior of the CPU when it was

00:08:31.736 --> 00:08:33.096 A:middle
scheduling our workloads.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.876 A:middle
So let's take a look at another

00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:35.196 A:middle
trace.

00:08:36.306 --> 00:08:37.155 A:middle
Here, we've got the same

00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:37.836 A:middle
situation.

00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:39.836 A:middle
Double wide blue bar is causing

00:08:39.836 --> 00:08:42.096 A:middle
us to drop a frame or rather is

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:42.746 A:middle
our dropped frame.

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:45.326 A:middle
Now here we can see a graph of

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:47.086 A:middle
our CPU's performance over time.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:49.176 A:middle
Now during most of those cheap

00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:50.876 A:middle
frames, our CPU performance is

00:08:50.876 --> 00:08:52.116 A:middle
staying pretty low.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:53.496 A:middle
There's no background work going

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:53.806 A:middle
on.

00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:55.256 A:middle
All we're doing is scrolling

00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:56.896 A:middle
things and that's exactly what

00:08:56.896 --> 00:08:58.416 A:middle
you would want because when

00:08:58.416 --> 00:08:59.976 A:middle
we're not doing expensive work

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:01.556 A:middle
for scrolling, you want to keep
