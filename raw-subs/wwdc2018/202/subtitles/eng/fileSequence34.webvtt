00:33:58.426 --> 00:34:01.096 A:middle
Session later this week.

00:34:01.576 --> 00:34:04.286 A:middle
Now, our final API enhancement

00:34:04.286 --> 00:34:05.826 A:middle
topic is actually a bit of a

00:34:05.826 --> 00:34:07.616 A:middle
review but now with a little bit

00:34:07.616 --> 00:34:08.366 A:middle
more context.

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:11.356 A:middle
So in iOS 11, we introduced Safe

00:34:11.356 --> 00:34:12.176 A:middle
Area insets.

00:34:12.766 --> 00:34:14.666 A:middle
Safe Area insets are a really

00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:16.716 A:middle
great way to make sure that your

00:34:16.716 --> 00:34:19.446 A:middle
content is avoiding any overlap

00:34:19.596 --> 00:34:21.525 A:middle
from other parts of the user

00:34:21.525 --> 00:34:23.376 A:middle
interface such as bars on the

00:34:23.446 --> 00:34:24.576 A:middle
top and bottom of the screen.

00:34:25.906 --> 00:34:27.755 A:middle
This is really great on iPhones

00:34:27.755 --> 00:34:28.726 A:middle
where bars are pretty

00:34:28.726 --> 00:34:30.886 A:middle
straightforward, but it's really

00:34:30.976 --> 00:34:31.936 A:middle
powerful as well.

00:34:32.565 --> 00:34:34.005 A:middle
Safe Area insets give you that

00:34:34.076 --> 00:34:35.426 A:middle
safe area coordinate in the

00:34:35.426 --> 00:34:37.596 A:middle
local coordinate space of any

00:34:37.596 --> 00:34:39.795 A:middle
view in your application, so it

00:34:39.795 --> 00:34:41.266 A:middle
scales even the much more

00:34:41.266 --> 00:34:43.646 A:middle
complex interfaces, things like

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.466 A:middle
iPad Split View which has

00:34:45.755 --> 00:34:48.346 A:middle
different height bars on the

00:34:48.346 --> 00:34:49.706 A:middle
master and detail side of the

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:50.186 A:middle
Split View.

00:34:50.735 --> 00:34:54.116 A:middle
The Safe Area insets in any view

00:34:54.116 --> 00:34:55.326 A:middle
underneath these bars will be

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.426 A:middle
appropriate for the amount that

00:34:56.426 --> 00:34:58.086 A:middle
they're overlapped by the bar on

00:34:58.126 --> 00:34:59.156 A:middle
their side of the split.
