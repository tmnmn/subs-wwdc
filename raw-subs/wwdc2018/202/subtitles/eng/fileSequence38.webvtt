00:37:58.806 --> 00:38:00.336 A:middle
it's really easy to add support

00:38:00.336 --> 00:38:01.256 A:middle
for Siri Shortcuts.

00:38:01.516 --> 00:38:02.696 A:middle
You just set Eligible for

00:38:02.696 --> 00:38:03.686 A:middle
Prediction to true.

00:38:04.096 --> 00:38:05.116 A:middle
And if you're not, this may

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.596 A:middle
still be a great way if your

00:38:06.776 --> 00:38:07.816 A:middle
shortcut fits into one of these

00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:08.486 A:middle
categories.

00:38:09.836 --> 00:38:11.846 A:middle
Now, if your app has other more

00:38:11.846 --> 00:38:13.426 A:middle
custom needs or if you just want

00:38:13.426 --> 00:38:14.886 A:middle
a lot more control, you can

00:38:14.886 --> 00:38:16.856 A:middle
adopt the Siri Kit Intents API.

00:38:17.836 --> 00:38:18.986 A:middle
Now Siri Kit Intents provides a

00:38:18.986 --> 00:38:20.636 A:middle
number of predefined intents

00:38:20.796 --> 00:38:22.596 A:middle
that you can easily adopt on

00:38:22.596 --> 00:38:22.966 A:middle
your own.

00:38:23.036 --> 00:38:24.456 A:middle
These are the same as the Siri

00:38:24.456 --> 00:38:25.866 A:middle
Kit Intents in previous years.

00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:27.696 A:middle
Now if your apps have more

00:38:27.896 --> 00:38:29.396 A:middle
custom behaviors, though, you

00:38:29.396 --> 00:38:30.966 A:middle
can now in iOS 12 define your

00:38:30.966 --> 00:38:32.936 A:middle
own custom intents.

00:38:33.736 --> 00:38:35.176 A:middle
Custom intents can be really

00:38:35.216 --> 00:38:36.696 A:middle
flexible and they do anything

00:38:36.696 --> 00:38:37.336 A:middle
that you would want.

00:38:37.846 --> 00:38:38.956 A:middle
In this case here, I've created

00:38:38.956 --> 00:38:40.526 A:middle
one to help me create my WWDC

00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:41.296 A:middle
slides next year.

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:43.436 A:middle
Now the categories that you

00:38:43.436 --> 00:38:45.066 A:middle
could put your intents in to are

00:38:45.066 --> 00:38:45.966 A:middle
pretty broad already.

00:38:46.236 --> 00:38:47.506 A:middle
So here I've used the Create

00:38:47.646 --> 00:38:48.236 A:middle
category.

00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.306 A:middle
But if your intents are even

00:38:50.306 --> 00:38:51.866 A:middle
more generic than that, there

00:38:51.866 --> 00:38:53.046 A:middle
are even more general ones

00:38:53.046 --> 00:38:54.886 A:middle
available such as General Do,

00:38:54.886 --> 00:38:56.336 A:middle
Run, and Go options.

00:38:57.776 --> 00:38:59.266 A:middle
Now once you've created your

00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:00.376 A:middle
intent, you also want to make it
