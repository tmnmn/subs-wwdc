00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:00.056 A:middle
APIs in the SDK, including

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:01.566 A:middle
notifications and messages.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.025 A:middle
And then we're going to end with

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:05.086 A:middle
Siri Shortcuts.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.126 A:middle
So let's get started with our

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:08.936 A:middle
first topic: Performance

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:09.776 A:middle
Updates.

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:12.716 A:middle
Now we're going to talk about

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:14.506 A:middle
performance across three main

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:17.876 A:middle
areas: scrolling, memory, and

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:18.546 A:middle
auto layout.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:21.726 A:middle
Now before we get in to it, it's

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.106 A:middle
important to keep in mind one

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:24.146 A:middle
little bit of background

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:25.496 A:middle
information about scrolling.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.076 A:middle
Scrolling on iOS follows a

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.836 A:middle
pretty common pattern in most

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:32.236 A:middle
places.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.536 A:middle
We load content to be displayed

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:36.336 A:middle
into the views and then we're

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:38.096 A:middle
just moving that content around.

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:39.666 A:middle
And while we're moving it

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.546 A:middle
around, most of those frames are

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:43.036 A:middle
really cheap to generate because

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.376 A:middle
we don't have to load anything

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:44.656 A:middle
new.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:47.226 A:middle
But every now and then, a new

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.506 A:middle
view first becomes visible and

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:51.096 A:middle
the one frame when that first

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:53.206 A:middle
happens is quite a bit more

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:54.816 A:middle
expensive to generate than those

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:55.776 A:middle
other cheaper ones.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:58.656 A:middle
Now, of course, once that one

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.476 A:middle
frame is loaded, we're just back
