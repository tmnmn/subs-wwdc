00:14:58.226 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
be 2.2 megabytes of memory to

00:15:00.406 --> 00:15:00.976 A:middle
draw a prairie dog.

00:15:02.096 --> 00:15:03.426 A:middle
That seems like a pretty decent

00:15:03.426 --> 00:15:05.186 A:middle
amount, but in this case that's

00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:06.586 A:middle
actually probably memory well

00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:06.966 A:middle
spent.

00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:08.306 A:middle
We're actually trying to

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:10.226 A:middle
represent this full-fidelity

00:15:10.226 --> 00:15:11.816 A:middle
image and that's the amount of

00:15:11.816 --> 00:15:13.116 A:middle
memory that's needed to draw it

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:13.736 A:middle
into this buffer.

00:15:14.086 --> 00:15:15.576 A:middle
So that's probably expected.

00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:17.736 A:middle
But now let's say that we were

00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.266 A:middle
going to draw a lower-fidelity

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.316 A:middle
version of our prairie dog,

00:15:21.626 --> 00:15:22.606 A:middle
maybe something in black and

00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:23.416 A:middle
white that we were going to

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:25.186 A:middle
sketch out with core graphics,

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:26.556 A:middle
maybe it was drawn with an Apple

00:15:26.616 --> 00:15:27.666 A:middle
pencil on an iPad.

00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:29.096 A:middle
That might look something like

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:29.456 A:middle
this.

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.636 A:middle
So how much memory is our

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:34.156 A:middle
low-fidelity prairie dog going

00:15:34.156 --> 00:15:34.606 A:middle
to use?

00:15:35.506 --> 00:15:37.556 A:middle
Well, it'll actually use the

00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:38.766 A:middle
exact same amount of memory.

00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:41.286 A:middle
Now here, that clearly is not as

00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:42.236 A:middle
good of a use of memory.

00:15:42.236 --> 00:15:43.306 A:middle
It's all grayscale.

00:15:43.796 --> 00:15:45.236 A:middle
All of that deep color

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.436 A:middle
information is not even being

00:15:47.436 --> 00:15:48.736 A:middle
used in this image.

00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:50.416 A:middle
So hopefully we could do much

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:53.456 A:middle
better and iOS 12 introduces

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:54.906 A:middle
automatic backing store support

00:15:54.906 --> 00:15:57.456 A:middle
to help make that exactly be the

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:57.686 A:middle
case.

00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:00.866 A:middle
So all of your views now that
