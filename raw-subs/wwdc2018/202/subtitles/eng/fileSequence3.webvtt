00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:01.476 A:middle
including a fairly large amount

00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:02.856 A:middle
of expensive operations like

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.416 A:middle
reading files, loading data out

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:06.916 A:middle
of databases, or other things of

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:07.516 A:middle
that nature.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:09.056 A:middle
So you'll definitely want to

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.536 A:middle
look at the expense here in your

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:13.396 A:middle
own apps but it tends to be this

00:03:13.396 --> 00:03:14.616 A:middle
is where a good portion of it

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:15.686 A:middle
will exist.

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:18.956 A:middle
Now, you may think looking here

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:19.936 A:middle
that that's the end of the

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:21.766 A:middle
expensive work but even once you

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.006 A:middle
return from this method, there's

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:24.316 A:middle
actually more work that has to

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:25.956 A:middle
happen in order to get the cell

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:27.086 A:middle
prepared to have it show up on

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:27.506 A:middle
screen.

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:29.786 A:middle
So, of course, next, we have to

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.306 A:middle
lay out all of the content in

00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:31.836 A:middle
that cell.

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:33.936 A:middle
We need to size all the views

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:34.866 A:middle
and position them in the right

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:35.686 A:middle
spot.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:37.276 A:middle
Now, this can actually be a

00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:38.476 A:middle
pretty substantial amount of the

00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:39.736 A:middle
total time that we're spending

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:41.176 A:middle
because it can include other

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:42.946 A:middle
expensive operations like

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.666 A:middle
measuring text.

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:46.886 A:middle
Once everything is properly

00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:48.666 A:middle
sized and positioned, then it's

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.736 A:middle
time to generate any content

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:52.276 A:middle
that would need to be drawn

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:54.116 A:middle
using drawing calls and to do

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:55.606 A:middle
that we have to call draw Rect

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.246 A:middle
on all of the subviews within

00:03:57.246 --> 00:03:57.746 A:middle
that cell.

00:03:58.276 --> 00:03:59.816 A:middle
Again, this can be a pretty

00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:01.216 A:middle
large amount of the time because
