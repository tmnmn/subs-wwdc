00:21:58.226 --> 00:22:00.096 A:middle
to UIKit are all automatically

00:22:00.096 --> 00:22:01.706 A:middle
migratable so there's no

00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:02.546 A:middle
additional work that you should

00:22:02.546 --> 00:22:03.966 A:middle
have to do in order to get these

00:22:03.966 --> 00:22:04.536 A:middle
updates.

00:22:05.746 --> 00:22:07.536 A:middle
Now, these updates fall into

00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:08.766 A:middle
really three categories that

00:22:08.766 --> 00:22:09.736 A:middle
we'll talk about this morning,

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:11.756 A:middle
although there's actually a ton

00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:13.856 A:middle
of improvements and consistency

00:22:13.856 --> 00:22:15.076 A:middle
improvements that you'll find as

00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:15.816 A:middle
you look at the SDK.

00:22:16.566 --> 00:22:17.326 A:middle
But today we'll talk about

00:22:17.326 --> 00:22:19.126 A:middle
nesting of types, constants, and

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:19.586 A:middle
functions.

00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:22.176 A:middle
So let's first look at nesting

00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:22.636 A:middle
types.

00:22:23.516 --> 00:22:25.476 A:middle
Now in Swift 4, there were a

00:22:25.476 --> 00:22:26.776 A:middle
number of types that were in the

00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:28.766 A:middle
global name space, things like

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:30.006 A:middle
UI Application State.

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:32.916 A:middle
For types like this that have a

00:22:32.966 --> 00:22:35.096 A:middle
really strong use along with

00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:37.276 A:middle
another class, we've now nested

00:22:37.276 --> 00:22:38.016 A:middle
them within this class.

00:22:38.796 --> 00:22:39.746 A:middle
So we looked at all the

00:22:39.746 --> 00:22:42.156 A:middle
enumerations and other global

00:22:42.206 --> 00:22:43.796 A:middle
types of this sort and now have

00:22:43.796 --> 00:22:45.476 A:middle
moved them to be child types of

00:22:45.646 --> 00:22:46.576 A:middle
the relevant class.

00:22:46.906 --> 00:22:47.576 A:middle
So this becomes

00:22:47.576 --> 00:22:49.326 A:middle
UIApplication.State.

00:22:49.796 --> 00:22:51.536 A:middle
This sends a much stronger

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.786 A:middle
message about the relationship

00:22:52.786 --> 00:22:54.216 A:middle
between these two and makes them

00:22:54.216 --> 00:22:55.276 A:middle
easier to find as well.

00:22:56.046 --> 00:22:57.546 A:middle
Now in comes cases this can also

00:22:57.546 --> 00:23:00.286 A:middle
help improve understandability
