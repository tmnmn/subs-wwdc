00:29:59.426 --> 00:30:01.126 A:middle
iMessage stickers directly into

00:30:01.126 --> 00:30:02.316 A:middle
the camera as well.

00:30:02.916 --> 00:30:04.006 A:middle
If you're using the Xcode

00:30:04.046 --> 00:30:05.696 A:middle
sticker template, this will work

00:30:05.696 --> 00:30:07.196 A:middle
automatically by default with no

00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:07.976 A:middle
additional work on your behalf.

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:11.776 A:middle
But if you're building a more

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:14.336 A:middle
custom sticker experience using

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:15.376 A:middle
the MS Messages App View

00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:17.726 A:middle
Controller, some small amount of

00:30:17.726 --> 00:30:18.846 A:middle
adoption is required.

00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:21.076 A:middle
Now there's a new MS Messages

00:30:21.116 --> 00:30:22.786 A:middle
Supported Presentation Contexts

00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:25.166 A:middle
API that you can add into your

00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:27.436 A:middle
user info plist and then specify

00:30:27.436 --> 00:30:28.786 A:middle
that you want to appear both in

00:30:28.786 --> 00:30:30.446 A:middle
the messages context and the

00:30:30.446 --> 00:30:31.326 A:middle
media context.

00:30:32.076 --> 00:30:33.506 A:middle
Once you've done that, your apps

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:34.706 A:middle
will appear both in the App

00:30:34.706 --> 00:30:37.806 A:middle
Strip and also within the

00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:38.176 A:middle
camera.

00:30:39.046 --> 00:30:40.696 A:middle
Now if at runtime you need to

00:30:40.696 --> 00:30:41.956 A:middle
figure out which context you're

00:30:41.956 --> 00:30:43.596 A:middle
in so that for example you want

00:30:43.596 --> 00:30:45.076 A:middle
to customize the display of your

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.646 A:middle
stickers a little bit, there's a

00:30:46.646 --> 00:30:48.036 A:middle
new API for that as well.

00:30:48.676 --> 00:30:51.316 A:middle
By checking the presentation

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.586 A:middle
context, you can quickly see

00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:54.246 A:middle
whether you're in messages or in

00:30:55.176 --> 00:30:56.026 A:middle
the camera.

00:30:56.176 --> 00:30:57.526 A:middle
Now in addition to these

00:30:57.526 --> 00:30:59.716 A:middle
features, iOS 12 also brings a

00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:01.456 A:middle
new access for interaction to
