00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:00.726 A:middle
of cases where there were some

00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:02.496 A:middle
common pitfalls that different

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:03.546 A:middle
apps were falling in to.

00:18:04.026 --> 00:18:05.086 A:middle
So we'll show you some of the

00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:06.406 A:middle
simple best practices that you

00:18:06.406 --> 00:18:08.376 A:middle
can follow in order to optimize

00:18:08.376 --> 00:18:09.486 A:middle
your app layout as well.

00:18:10.796 --> 00:18:11.766 A:middle
So this morning, though, let's

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.466 A:middle
look at how Auto Layout is

00:18:13.466 --> 00:18:16.306 A:middle
faster by default in iOS 12 by

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:17.976 A:middle
looking at the asymptotic

00:18:18.016 --> 00:18:20.996 A:middle
behavior of Auto Layout as we

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:23.336 A:middle
add more views in some common

00:18:23.446 --> 00:18:24.296 A:middle
user scenarios.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.346 A:middle
Now, we're looking at the

00:18:26.346 --> 00:18:28.196 A:middle
asymptotics because we really

00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:29.476 A:middle
want to look at what happens as

00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:31.056 A:middle
we dramatically increase the

00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:31.956 A:middle
number of views.

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:33.776 A:middle
This can really make performance

00:18:33.776 --> 00:18:35.486 A:middle
issues show up quickly when we

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:37.216 A:middle
go to a really like absurdly

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.356 A:middle
large number of views.

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:39.916 A:middle
That just helps us see it

00:18:39.916 --> 00:18:40.186 A:middle
though.

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:41.776 A:middle
The optimizations really do

00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:43.316 A:middle
apply and make things faster

00:18:43.316 --> 00:18:44.906 A:middle
even for small numbers of views.

00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:46.506 A:middle
So let's start with a really

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:48.366 A:middle
common pattern, the simplest

00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:50.246 A:middle
case really, Independent Sibling

00:18:50.246 --> 00:18:52.576 A:middle
Views inside of some container.

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.156 A:middle
Now, these views are positioned

00:18:54.156 --> 00:18:55.386 A:middle
with constraints against the

00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:57.596 A:middle
container or other views but not

00:18:57.596 --> 00:18:58.536 A:middle
against each other.

00:18:58.666 --> 00:18:59.566 A:middle
They're independent of one

00:18:59.566 --> 00:18:59.876 A:middle
another.
