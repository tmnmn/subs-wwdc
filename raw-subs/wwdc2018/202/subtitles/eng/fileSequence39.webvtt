00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:00.376 A:middle
intent, you also want to make it

00:39:00.376 --> 00:39:01.586 A:middle
really easy for your customers

00:39:01.586 --> 00:39:02.916 A:middle
to create these custom shortcuts

00:39:02.916 --> 00:39:03.426 A:middle
to get to them.

00:39:03.926 --> 00:39:05.526 A:middle
And so there's now an API from

00:39:05.526 --> 00:39:06.796 A:middle
right within your app you can

00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:08.396 A:middle
allow customers to create a

00:39:08.466 --> 00:39:09.466 A:middle
custom voice shortcut.

00:39:09.876 --> 00:39:10.816 A:middle
So here I've got a button that

00:39:10.816 --> 00:39:12.066 A:middle
will just bring up a new panel

00:39:12.326 --> 00:39:14.336 A:middle
enabling me to create a new

00:39:14.336 --> 00:39:15.956 A:middle
shortcut right within my app as

00:39:16.036 --> 00:39:17.346 A:middle
soon as I finished an operation.

00:39:17.936 --> 00:39:18.666 A:middle
So if you're doing something

00:39:18.666 --> 00:39:19.716 A:middle
like ordering a coffee in the

00:39:19.716 --> 00:39:21.326 A:middle
morning and you notice it's

00:39:22.086 --> 00:39:23.756 A:middle
something that might be done

00:39:23.756 --> 00:39:25.176 A:middle
again, this is a great

00:39:25.176 --> 00:39:27.186 A:middle
opportunity to offer to create a

00:39:27.266 --> 00:39:28.506 A:middle
Siri Shortcut to do that next

00:39:28.506 --> 00:39:28.736 A:middle
time.

00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:30.596 A:middle
Now even better, you can also

00:39:30.596 --> 00:39:32.066 A:middle
combine these shortcuts together

00:39:32.066 --> 00:39:34.236 A:middle
using the new Shortcuts app

00:39:34.236 --> 00:39:35.196 A:middle
available from the app store.

00:39:35.696 --> 00:39:37.176 A:middle
So you can learn all about this

00:39:37.176 --> 00:39:38.056 A:middle
and much more in the

00:39:38.056 --> 00:39:40.326 A:middle
Introduction to Siri Shortcuts,

00:39:40.856 --> 00:39:41.776 A:middle
Building for Voice Siri

00:39:41.776 --> 00:39:44.006 A:middle
Shortcuts, and Siri Shortcuts on

00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:45.326 A:middle
the Siri Watch Face Sessions

00:39:45.526 --> 00:39:45.976 A:middle
later this week.

00:39:46.136 --> 00:39:48.886 A:middle
So we've talked a lot this

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.376 A:middle
morning about what's new in iOS

00:39:50.466 --> 00:39:52.796 A:middle
12, but there are also a number

00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:54.076 A:middle
of great sessions that are worth

00:39:54.076 --> 00:39:54.986 A:middle
mentioning that aren't

00:39:54.986 --> 00:39:56.286 A:middle
necessarily about what's new.

00:39:56.886 --> 00:39:58.386 A:middle
So if you're new to creating

00:39:58.386 --> 00:40:00.386 A:middle
apps for iOS, there's a really
