00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:02.296 A:middle
Now adopting this is really

00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:02.676 A:middle
easy.

00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:04.736 A:middle
It's just a UI Table View Data

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.976 A:middle
Source Prefetching protocol and

00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:08.786 A:middle
it only has two methods, only

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:09.766 A:middle
one of which is actually

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:10.346 A:middle
required.

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.196 A:middle
And the idea here is to move

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.536 A:middle
some of that expensive work of

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:14.956 A:middle
loading things from files or

00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:17.626 A:middle
reading your database into here

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:18.766 A:middle
so that you don't have to do it

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:19.416 A:middle
on demand.

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:21.436 A:middle
You data is already prepared

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.736 A:middle
when the cell is needed for

00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:22.956 A:middle
display.

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:28.346 A:middle
So this in most cases can be a

00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:31.346 A:middle
really big win although while we

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:32.606 A:middle
were looking at some of our own

00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:34.546 A:middle
apps in iOS 12, we actually

00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:36.456 A:middle
noticed a case where this was

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:38.006 A:middle
causing an issue instead of

00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:38.546 A:middle
helping us.

00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:40.236 A:middle
So let's take a look at what

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:42.846 A:middle
that looked like.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:45.476 A:middle
Now here's an example of a trace

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.156 A:middle
that we took while scrolling on

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:48.236 A:middle
an iPhone 6 Plus.

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:50.986 A:middle
The vertical bars across the

00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:53.166 A:middle
top, those represent frames that

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.166 A:middle
we want to display.

00:05:55.006 --> 00:05:56.506 A:middle
The alternating light and dark

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:58.246 A:middle
blue colors represent frames

00:05:58.246 --> 00:05:59.896 A:middle
that we did swap to the display

00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:01.096 A:middle
as they were changing.
