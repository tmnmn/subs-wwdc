00:09:58.716 --> 00:10:00.346 A:middle
where the load starts right

00:10:00.346 --> 00:10:02.066 A:middle
here, we end up seeing that

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.676 A:middle
we've ramped the CPU far more

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
frequently or, far more quickly,

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.206 A:middle
to the exact amount of perform

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:08.736 A:middle
it needs to make sure that we

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:10.426 A:middle
hit that deadline and don't drop

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:10.976 A:middle
frames.

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:13.806 A:middle
This has caused a really great

00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:14.976 A:middle
improvement across many

00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:16.226 A:middle
different scrolling scenarios

00:10:16.226 --> 00:10:16.976 A:middle
around iOS.

00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:24.086 A:middle
So all of your applications will

00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:25.666 A:middle
get all of this enhancements,

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:27.146 A:middle
both of them and a number of

00:10:27.146 --> 00:10:28.526 A:middle
others, for free with no

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:29.686 A:middle
additional work on your part,

00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:31.266 A:middle
but there are a couple of things

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:32.466 A:middle
that you can do to make sure

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:33.666 A:middle
that you get the most out of

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:34.136 A:middle
both of them.

00:10:34.996 --> 00:10:36.216 A:middle
So first of all, if you haven't

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:37.666 A:middle
already adopted that tableView

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:39.116 A:middle
cell prefetching API or the

00:10:39.116 --> 00:10:40.596 A:middle
Collection View one, definitely

00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:42.096 A:middle
look into that because having

00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:43.336 A:middle
your data ready is one of the

00:10:43.336 --> 00:10:44.596 A:middle
best things you can do to make

00:10:44.596 --> 00:10:46.076 A:middle
sure that loading cells is as

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:46.836 A:middle
quick as possible.

00:10:47.406 --> 00:10:50.506 A:middle
Of course, it's also important

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:51.856 A:middle
that you profile your full

00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:53.116 A:middle
critical sections of your cell

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:55.186 A:middle
loading and reduce that demand

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:56.076 A:middle
as much as you can.

00:10:56.076 --> 00:10:58.966 A:middle
iOS 12 will now try to match the

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:00.416 A:middle
CPU performance to the needs of
