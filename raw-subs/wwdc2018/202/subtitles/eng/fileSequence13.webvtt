00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:00.406 A:middle
Well, we'll make that big

00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:02.826 A:middle
request and now that is more

00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:04.556 A:middle
memory that is currently easily

00:13:04.556 --> 00:13:05.916 A:middle
readily available to the system.

00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:07.596 A:middle
So it won't be able to satisfy

00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:09.156 A:middle
it immediately and we'll have to

00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:10.566 A:middle
go find that memory from

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:11.216 A:middle
somewhere else.

00:13:12.206 --> 00:13:13.596 A:middle
And, in fact, the most likely

00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:15.436 A:middle
place to come from is from other

00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:17.966 A:middle
applications or things on the

00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:18.756 A:middle
system.

00:13:18.876 --> 00:13:20.156 A:middle
Now, that might not worry you

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:21.106 A:middle
too much because you're trying

00:13:21.106 --> 00:13:22.106 A:middle
to get the memory for your app

00:13:22.106 --> 00:13:23.386 A:middle
right now, so you're not so

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:24.376 A:middle
worried about what's happening

00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:24.906 A:middle
elsewhere.

00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:28.076 A:middle
But, of course, this will have

00:13:28.076 --> 00:13:29.356 A:middle
an impact on something else

00:13:29.436 --> 00:13:30.696 A:middle
later that your customers will

00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:32.066 A:middle
be expecting will be working,

00:13:32.636 --> 00:13:33.906 A:middle
but more importantly to you

00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:35.496 A:middle
right now, it will have an

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:37.146 A:middle
impact on your app as well

00:13:37.146 --> 00:13:39.106 A:middle
because the system has to do

00:13:39.106 --> 00:13:40.906 A:middle
work to go get this memory for

00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:41.126 A:middle
you.

00:13:41.366 --> 00:13:42.666 A:middle
The fact that it's not readily

00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:44.776 A:middle
available means that the kernel

00:13:44.776 --> 00:13:46.936 A:middle
has to go find it and perform

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:49.446 A:middle
operations on the CPU in order

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:50.216 A:middle
to make it available.

00:13:50.726 --> 00:13:51.856 A:middle
And that time it's spending

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:53.386 A:middle
getting that memory for you is

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.796 A:middle
time that could be better spent

00:13:54.796 --> 00:13:56.086 A:middle
doing whatever your app does

00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:56.466 A:middle
best.

00:13:57.126 --> 00:13:58.656 A:middle
So finding ways to either chunk

00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:00.036 A:middle
these larger requests or just
