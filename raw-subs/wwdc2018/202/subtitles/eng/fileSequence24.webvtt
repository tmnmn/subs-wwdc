00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:01.326 A:middle
the other global constants all

00:24:01.326 --> 00:24:03.806 A:middle
throughout UIKit and nested all

00:24:03.806 --> 00:24:05.006 A:middle
of them in appropriate places.

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:06.486 A:middle
So things like UI Float Range

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:08.536 A:middle
Zero and UI Float Range Infinite

00:24:08.536 --> 00:24:10.216 A:middle
have not just become properties

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:12.396 A:middle
on UI Float Range so they're

00:24:12.396 --> 00:24:14.326 A:middle
both easy to find and easier to

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:14.786 A:middle
use.

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:16.686 A:middle
In places to take a UI Float

00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:18.096 A:middle
Range, you can now just type

00:24:18.206 --> 00:24:20.386 A:middle
.zero or .infinite and, in fact,

00:24:20.616 --> 00:24:21.656 A:middle
because they're now properties,

00:24:21.906 --> 00:24:23.226 A:middle
Xcode can suggest them as

00:24:23.226 --> 00:24:24.866 A:middle
auto-completions for you in

00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:26.666 A:middle
places where they make sense.

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:29.046 A:middle
Now in addition to constants,

00:24:29.046 --> 00:24:30.316 A:middle
we've also audited all of our

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:31.056 A:middle
global functions.

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:32.776 A:middle
So things like UI Edge Inserts

00:24:32.776 --> 00:24:36.206 A:middle
and UI Image had some global

00:24:36.206 --> 00:24:37.376 A:middle
functions for operating on

00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:38.076 A:middle
different types.

00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:40.326 A:middle
Now in Swift 4.2, these had

00:24:40.326 --> 00:24:42.676 A:middle
become methods on the

00:24:42.676 --> 00:24:43.796 A:middle
appropriate type.

00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:46.286 A:middle
So it's now really easy to inset

00:24:46.326 --> 00:24:48.196 A:middle
Rect or get png Data from an

00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:50.366 A:middle
image in a really natural Swift

00:24:50.366 --> 00:24:51.046 A:middle
feeling way.

00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:57.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:59.176 A:middle
Now, here was one other big

00:24:59.176 --> 00:25:00.286 A:middle
class of functions that I want
