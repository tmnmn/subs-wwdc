[security.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=51) [Then we're going to talk

started with our](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=65) [first topic: Performance](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=67) [Updates.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=69) [Now we're going to talk about](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=71) [performance across three main](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=72) [areas: scrolling, memory, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=74) [auto layout.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=77) [Now before we get in to it, it's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=79) [important to keep in mind one](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=81) [little bit of background](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=83) [information about scrolling.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=84) [Scrolling on iOS follows a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=87) [pretty common pattern in most](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=90) [places.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=91) [We load content to be displayed](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=92) [into the views and then we're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=94) [just moving that content around.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=96) [And while we're moving it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=98) [around, most of those frames are](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=99) [really cheap to generate because](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=101) [we don't have to load anything](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=103) [new.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=104) [But every now and then, a new](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=105) [view first becomes visible and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=107) [the one frame when that first](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=109) [happens is quite a bit more](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=111) [expensive to generate than those](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=113) [other cheaper ones.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=114) [Now, of course, once that one](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=116) [frame is loaded, we're just back](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=118) [frame is loaded, we're just back](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=118) [to moving content around, so the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=120) [amount of work we do on the CPU](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=122) [goes back to being pretty small](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=123) [for most of that other](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=125) [scrolling.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=126) [So what's happening during that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=127) [really expensive frame that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=130) [causes that one to be more than](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=131) [all the others?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=133) [Well, let's take a look from the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=134) [perspective UI Table View but](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=136) [everything we look at here will](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=138) [really be the same for UI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=139) [Collection View or really any of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=140) [your own custom views that you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=142) [may build that behave in similar](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=143) [ways.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=144) [So the work in that expensive](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=145) [frame probably starts in your](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=148) [implementation of TableView,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=150) [cell For Row At index Path](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=152) [delegate method.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=153) [Now the first thing we're going](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=154) [to do in there is get the cell](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=156) [that we want to display.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=158) [And so we're going to try and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=159) [dequeue it ideally from the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=160) [reuse queue although if one is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=162) [not available already in the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=164) [queue, we might actually have to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=165) [do some memory allocation in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=166) [order to get it ready.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=168) [Once we have the cell, we're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=171) [then going to populate it with](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=172) [your model data.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=173) [Now how expensive that is will](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=174) [vary depending on your](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=176) [application but it can be](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=177) [including a fairly large amount](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=179) [including a fairly large amount](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=179) [of expensive operations like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=181) [reading files, loading data out](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=182) [of databases, or other things of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=185) [that nature.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=186) [So you'll definitely want to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=187) [look at the expense here in your](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=189) [own apps but it tends to be this](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=190) [is where a good portion of it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=193) [will exist.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=194) [Now, you may think looking here](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=197) [that that's the end of the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=198) [expensive work but even once you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=199) [return from this method, there's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=201) [actually more work that has to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=203) [happen in order to get the cell](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=204) [prepared to have it show up on](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=205) [screen.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=207) [So, of course, next, we have to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=208) [lay out all of the content in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=209) [that cell.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=211) [We need to size all the views](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=212) [and position them in the right](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=213) [spot.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=214) [Now, this can actually be a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=216) [pretty substantial amount of the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=217) [total time that we're spending](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=218) [because it can include other](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=219) [expensive operations like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=221) [measuring text.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=223) [Once everything is properly](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=225) [sized and positioned, then it's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=226) [time to generate any content](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=228) [that would need to be drawn](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=230) [using drawing calls and to do](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=232) [that we have to call draw Rect](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=234) [on all of the subviews within](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=235) [that cell.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=237) [Again, this can be a pretty](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=238) [large amount of the time because](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=239) [large amount of the time because](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=239) [we'll also be doing things like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=241) [drawing text.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=243) [So overall, there's a lot of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=245) [work that has to happen across](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=247) [this whole piece of code and it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=248) [has to happen in a really short](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=251) [period of time.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=252) [On our 60-hertz devices, you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=254) [have 16 milliseconds to complete](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=255) [all this work in order to make](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=257) [sure you don't drop any frames,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=259) [and maintain smooth scrolling.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=260) [On our 12-hertz iPads, on the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=263) [iPad Pro, you have only 8](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=265) [milliseconds to complete all of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=267) [that work.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=269) [So, it really needs to be done](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=270) [as quickly as possible.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=271) [Now, to help with that, in iOS](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=274) [10, we introduced a cell](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=276) [prefetching API and the idea](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=277) [with the prefetch API is to take](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=280) [some of this work, populating](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=282) [your cell with model data, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=283) [pull it out of this

a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=290) [background thread so it can](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=292) [happen

[large number of views.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1117) [That just helps us see

positioned](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1133) [with constraints against

[Basically, what we're saying is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1152) [that there's a fixed constant](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1153) [cost for each additional

to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1179) [take a look at Dependent](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1181) [Siblings.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1182) [So this is the case where

for Swift 4.2 we really](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1294) [wanted to make sure that UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1296) [had a really great feel when](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1298) [used in Swift across your app,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1300) [especially where it

class.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1357) [So we looked at all the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/?time=1358)
