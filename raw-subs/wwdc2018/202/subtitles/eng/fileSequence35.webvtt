00:35:01.156 --> 00:35:02.606 A:middle
So this is really great on

00:35:02.606 --> 00:35:04.366 A:middle
devices with rectangular screens

00:35:04.866 --> 00:35:06.906 A:middle
but it also is really powerful

00:35:06.906 --> 00:35:07.946 A:middle
on devices that have

00:35:08.126 --> 00:35:09.636 A:middle
non-rectangular screens like

00:35:09.636 --> 00:35:10.286 A:middle
iPhone X.

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:12.986 A:middle
Now, you can see here we've got

00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.916 A:middle
our larger bars at the top and

00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:16.236 A:middle
bottom than we have on devices

00:35:16.236 --> 00:35:17.066 A:middle
that have home buttons.

00:35:17.686 --> 00:35:18.616 A:middle
And the Safe Area insets

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.956 A:middle
obviously have just grown to

00:35:19.956 --> 00:35:21.286 A:middle
accommodate that larger size.

00:35:21.946 --> 00:35:23.796 A:middle
Now, unique to iPhone X is that

00:35:23.846 --> 00:35:25.746 A:middle
there are Safe Area insets even

00:35:25.746 --> 00:35:27.226 A:middle
in cases where no bars are

00:35:27.296 --> 00:35:29.586 A:middle
present and this extends the

00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:31.806 A:middle
landscape mode too where it can

00:35:31.806 --> 00:35:32.826 A:middle
really help you make sure that

00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:34.596 A:middle
you've got a rectangular area at

00:35:34.596 --> 00:35:36.426 A:middle
all times that's safe to display

00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:38.606 A:middle
content and will never be

00:35:40.676 --> 00:35:40.846 A:middle
clipped.

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:43.426 A:middle
So I want to thank you all for

00:35:43.426 --> 00:35:44.856 A:middle
those of you who have adopted

00:35:44.956 --> 00:35:46.256 A:middle
Safe Area insets and updated

00:35:46.256 --> 00:35:48.306 A:middle
your apps for iPhone X.

00:35:48.536 --> 00:35:49.806 A:middle
It's been a really great

00:35:49.806 --> 00:35:51.076 A:middle
experience over the last year

00:35:51.146 --> 00:35:52.326 A:middle
and I'm sure most of you have

00:35:52.326 --> 00:35:52.996 A:middle
already done that.

00:35:53.536 --> 00:35:55.206 A:middle
If you haven't, now is a really

00:35:55.206 --> 00:35:56.176 A:middle
great time to do so.

00:35:56.836 --> 00:35:57.986 A:middle
Your customers will always

00:35:57.986 --> 00:35:59.466 A:middle
prefer apps that are being kept

00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:01.716 A:middle
up to date and support for
