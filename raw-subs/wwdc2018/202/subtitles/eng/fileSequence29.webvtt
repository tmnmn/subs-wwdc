00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:00.526 A:middle
thread identifier and then all

00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:01.776 A:middle
the notifications for that

00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:03.976 A:middle
threat identifier will appear in

00:29:03.976 --> 00:29:04.586 A:middle
a single group.

00:29:05.106 --> 00:29:08.106 A:middle
Now the UI updates for

00:29:08.106 --> 00:29:10.746 A:middle
notifications in iOS 12 also

00:29:10.746 --> 00:29:13.246 A:middle
include some new ability for

00:29:13.246 --> 00:29:16.026 A:middle
users to customize the delivery

00:29:16.026 --> 00:29:17.526 A:middle
behavior of their notifications.

00:29:18.436 --> 00:29:19.836 A:middle
But, of course, your apps may

00:29:19.836 --> 00:29:21.436 A:middle
also include some existing, more

00:29:21.436 --> 00:29:22.996 A:middle
granular controls for

00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:24.966 A:middle
notification management within

00:29:24.966 --> 00:29:25.876 A:middle
your apps as well.

00:29:26.436 --> 00:29:28.316 A:middle
And iOS 12 introduces a new API

00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:29.686 A:middle
that makes it easy for your

00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:31.546 A:middle
customers to get directly deep

00:29:31.546 --> 00:29:33.336 A:middle
linked into your notification

00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:35.056 A:middle
settings UI exactly when they're

00:29:35.056 --> 00:29:36.486 A:middle
looking for those more granular

00:29:36.486 --> 00:29:37.096 A:middle
controls.

00:29:37.096 --> 00:29:39.836 A:middle
So you can learn more about all

00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:41.576 A:middle
of these notification things in

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:43.266 A:middle

later this week.

00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:48.086 A:middle
That's notifications.

00:29:49.006 --> 00:29:52.516 A:middle
Next, let's talk about messages.

00:29:52.586 --> 00:29:54.856 A:middle
Now messages in iOS 12 includes

00:29:54.856 --> 00:29:56.336 A:middle

features in the camera.

00:29:58.166 --> 00:29:59.426 A:middle
And you can bring all of your
