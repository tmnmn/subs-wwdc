00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:02.206 A:middle
Now in iOS 12, these passwords

00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:04.596 A:middle
can also be stored into iCloud

00:32:04.686 --> 00:32:06.506 A:middle
Keychain from your apps both

00:32:06.506 --> 00:32:09.006 A:middle
from your login window flows and

00:32:09.006 --> 00:32:10.926 A:middle
also from your password change

00:32:10.926 --> 00:32:12.086 A:middle
request UIs.

00:32:13.296 --> 00:32:14.666 A:middle
As soon as a user logs in,

00:32:14.956 --> 00:32:16.156 A:middle
they'll be prompted to save the

00:32:16.156 --> 00:32:17.626 A:middle
password to iCloud Keychain.

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.226 A:middle
Now even better, iOS 12 can

00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:22.146 A:middle
automatically generate passwords

00:32:22.486 --> 00:32:25.026 A:middle
in your new account flows and in

00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:26.496 A:middle
your password change flows.

00:32:26.896 --> 00:32:28.536 A:middle
Adopting this is really easy.

00:32:28.896 --> 00:32:29.886 A:middle
You just make sure that you've

00:32:29.936 --> 00:32:31.996 A:middle
tagged your password fields with

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:33.856 A:middle
either the password text content

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:35.906 A:middle
type, if it's a login field, or

00:32:35.906 --> 00:32:37.726 A:middle
the new password text content

00:32:37.726 --> 00:32:39.146 A:middle
type if it's either a new

00:32:39.146 --> 00:32:40.416 A:middle
account or password change

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:40.696 A:middle
field.

00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:45.226 A:middle
If your services have a specific

00:32:45.226 --> 00:32:47.166 A:middle
requirement on passwords for

00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:49.056 A:middle
example if they got required or

00:32:49.096 --> 00:32:51.226 A:middle
disallowed characters or if they

00:32:51.226 --> 00:32:53.146 A:middle
have other requirements such as

00:32:53.146 --> 00:32:55.026 A:middle
maximum number of consecutive

00:32:55.026 --> 00:32:56.586 A:middle
repeated characters, you can

00:32:56.586 --> 00:32:58.026 A:middle
specify these requirements as

00:32:58.026 --> 00:32:59.466 A:middle
well to make sure that the

00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:00.526 A:middle
automatically generated
