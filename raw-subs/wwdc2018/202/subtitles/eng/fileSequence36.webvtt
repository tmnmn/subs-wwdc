00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:01.716 A:middle
up to date and support for

00:36:01.756 --> 00:36:03.256 A:middle
iPhone X is a really visible

00:36:03.256 --> 00:36:04.296 A:middle
indicator of that being the

00:36:04.296 --> 00:36:04.596 A:middle
case.

00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:06.606 A:middle
So if you haven't, definitely go

00:36:06.606 --> 00:36:07.126 A:middle
do it now.

00:36:07.126 --> 00:36:08.626 A:middle
And to help make sure you have

00:36:08.626 --> 00:36:10.136 A:middle
all the information necessary to

00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:11.576 A:middle
do that, you can check out the

00:36:11.576 --> 00:36:13.526 A:middle
UIKit Apps for Every Size and

00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:15.226 A:middle
Shape Session later this week

00:36:15.446 --> 00:36:16.616 A:middle
which will tell you both all

00:36:16.616 --> 00:36:18.486 A:middle
about Safe Area insets and all

00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:20.776 A:middle
of the other related inset APIs

00:36:20.776 --> 00:36:22.336 A:middle
all throughout UIKit making it

00:36:22.336 --> 00:36:23.616 A:middle
easy to make sure you have apps

00:36:23.676 --> 00:36:26.646 A:middle
that scale to every shape and

00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:27.836 A:middle
size.

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:29.186 A:middle
So that's our framework updates

00:36:29.816 --> 00:36:31.686 A:middle
and our API enhancements.

00:36:31.986 --> 00:36:33.606 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Siri

00:36:33.606 --> 00:36:34.296 A:middle
Shortcuts.

00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:37.056 A:middle
So Siri Shortcuts is an exciting

00:36:37.056 --> 00:36:39.316 A:middle
new API in iOS 12.

00:36:41.516 --> 00:36:42.886 A:middle
Siri Shortcuts makes it easy to

00:36:42.886 --> 00:36:44.716 A:middle
get common actions out of your

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:47.296 A:middle
app and make them accessible via

00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:48.096 A:middle
Siri.

00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:50.726 A:middle
Now, Siri Shortcuts can be

00:36:50.726 --> 00:36:52.646 A:middle
suggested proactively right on

00:36:52.646 --> 00:36:54.286 A:middle
the coversheet making it easy to

00:36:54.416 --> 00:36:55.466 A:middle
access actions that you would

00:36:55.466 --> 00:36:57.426 A:middle
want to access at the exact time

00:36:57.426 --> 00:36:58.656 A:middle
and place that you want to

00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.436 A:middle
access them.
