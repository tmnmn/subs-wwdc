00:13:59.436 --> 00:14:01.136 A:middle
There's a new API and it is

00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:03.406 A:middle
fairly simple and you could

00:14:03.406 --> 00:14:04.616 A:middle
really be done adopting it

00:14:05.016 --> 00:14:06.146 A:middle
before leaving this session.

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:09.696 A:middle
And next we are going to walk

00:14:09.696 --> 00:14:11.096 A:middle
through the process for the

00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:12.636 A:middle
broadcast extension developers

00:14:13.196 --> 00:14:15.266 A:middle
and discuss how you can actually

00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:16.586 A:middle
implement the broadcast

00:14:16.586 --> 00:14:18.786 A:middle
extension and how things would

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:20.496 A:middle
work for you if your app

00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:22.696 A:middle
provides both the extension and

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:23.576 A:middle
the broadcast picker.

00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:26.966 A:middle
So let me come back to that

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:27.536 A:middle
diagram.

00:14:27.536 --> 00:14:28.796 A:middle
We are sort of moving to the

00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:31.306 A:middle
broadcast extension site now and

00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:32.966 A:middle
we want to show you the path

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:33.976 A:middle
assuming the system broadcast.

00:14:39.766 --> 00:14:41.006 A:middle
Let's start with talking about

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.966 A:middle
the broadcast application and

00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:45.656 A:middle
the broadcast extension and what

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:48.726 A:middle
each of them needs to do during

00:14:48.726 --> 00:14:50.796 A:middle
the system broadcast session.

00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:54.796 A:middle
So you install the broadcast

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:56.376 A:middle
extension along with the

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.496 A:middle
application that contains it.

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
So if you install Facebook, you
