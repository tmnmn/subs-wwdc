00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:01.756 A:middle
And what you actually need to

00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:03.876 A:middle
code is a broadcast extension

00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:06.206 A:middle
that does all the actual work of

00:27:06.206 --> 00:27:08.906 A:middle
encoding the video.

00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:11.126 A:middle
And also, we just discussed the

00:27:11.126 --> 00:27:12.696 A:middle
way to protect the content of

00:27:12.696 --> 00:27:12.936 A:middle
your apps.

00:27:17.336 --> 00:27:19.146 A:middle
You can find more information on

00:27:19.146 --> 00:27:21.606 A:middle
the website of our talk and we

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:22.966 A:middle
also will be having the

00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:25.156 A:middle
ReplayKit labs later today at

00:27:25.156 --> 00:27:26.716 A:middle
3:00 p.m. in the Technology Lab

00:27:26.806 --> 00:27:28.716 A:middle
5, so if you have any questions

00:27:28.766 --> 00:27:30.396 A:middle
or comments, please come.

00:27:30.396 --> 00:27:31.586 A:middle
We'd love to hear from you.

00:27:33.596 --> 00:27:35.436 A:middle
So thank you so much for being

00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:36.806 A:middle
here with us today.

00:27:36.936 --> 00:27:38.116 A:middle
We are really excited of

00:27:38.116 --> 00:27:40.036 A:middle
bringing you the new approach

00:27:40.636 --> 00:27:42.376 A:middle
for live stream broadcast in iOS

00:27:42.376 --> 00:27:44.356 A:middle
and looking forward to see test

00:27:44.356 --> 00:27:46.026 A:middle
applications adopting it.

00:27:46.616 --> 00:27:49.096 A:middle
So please go ahead, create your

00:27:49.156 --> 00:27:51.186 A:middle
first broadcast extension using

00:27:51.186 --> 00:27:53.356 A:middle
the Xcode template, or open your

00:27:53.356 --> 00:27:56.026 A:middle
existing project and add the

00:27:56.276 --> 00:27:58.426 A:middle
broadcast picker to your app and

00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.866 A:middle
enable live stream broadcast
