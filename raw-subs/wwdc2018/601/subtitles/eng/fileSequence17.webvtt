00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:00.136 A:middle
This is how the life cycle of

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:01.286 A:middle
the broadcast usually looks

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:01.526 A:middle
like.

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:05.685 A:middle
So we have states called setup,

00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:09.496 A:middle
initialized, started, processing

00:17:09.616 --> 00:17:10.156 A:middle
and stopped.

00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:14.606 A:middle
Over on the left there's this

00:17:14.646 --> 00:17:16.096 A:middle
green square which corresponds

00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:18.476 A:middle
to the state when your broadcast

00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:20.986 A:middle
extension is not running yet and

00:17:20.986 --> 00:17:23.415 A:middle
at this point your app could,

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:24.646 A:middle
for example, get the login

00:17:24.646 --> 00:17:26.526 A:middle
credentials from the user and

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:28.616 A:middle
use a shared keychain to process

00:17:28.616 --> 00:17:31.126 A:middle
credentials to the extension.

00:17:31.816 --> 00:17:34.226 A:middle
Or again, here you could let the

00:17:34.226 --> 00:17:35.906 A:middle
user to type in that message for

00:17:35.906 --> 00:17:39.326 A:middle
the Facebook part and pass it to

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:41.526 A:middle
the extension like one way or

00:17:41.526 --> 00:17:41.856 A:middle
another.

00:17:42.536 --> 00:17:45.356 A:middle
So once the user initiates a

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.386 A:middle
broadcast, using the Control

00:17:47.386 --> 00:17:49.656 A:middle
Center or your application that

00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:51.066 A:middle
adopted the broadcast picker,

00:17:52.526 --> 00:17:55.136 A:middle
ReplayKit launches an extension

00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:57.206 A:middle
process and creates an instance

00:17:57.206 --> 00:17:58.756 A:middle
of your SampleHandler class.

00:17:59.826 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
And at that point you can
