00:17:59.826 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
And at that point you can

00:18:02.626 --> 00:18:04.896 A:middle
override the default initializer

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
of SampleHandler and do

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.446 A:middle
something essential for your

00:18:08.446 --> 00:18:09.776 A:middle
broadcast and not directly

00:18:09.776 --> 00:18:11.216 A:middle
related to handling the media

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:11.626 A:middle
samples.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.856 A:middle
So, for example, you could get

00:18:15.626 --> 00:18:17.106 A:middle
login credentials from this

00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:19.096 A:middle
keychain and establish a

00:18:19.096 --> 00:18:20.526 A:middle
broadcast session with your

00:18:20.526 --> 00:18:21.006 A:middle
servers.

00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:25.316 A:middle
So once the process is launched

00:18:25.346 --> 00:18:26.556 A:middle
and the instance of your

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:28.846 A:middle
SampleHandler already exists,

00:18:30.456 --> 00:18:32.786 A:middle
the extension is notified that

00:18:32.856 --> 00:18:34.436 A:middle
ReplayKit will begin providing

00:18:34.436 --> 00:18:37.056 A:middle
it with audio and video samples

00:18:37.466 --> 00:18:38.566 A:middle
using the function called

00:18:38.626 --> 00:18:41.846 A:middle
broadcastStarted, and in this

00:18:41.846 --> 00:18:44.046 A:middle
function you'd probably like to

00:18:44.046 --> 00:18:46.646 A:middle
create your media engine or do

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:48.866 A:middle
anything else that you need to

00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:50.336 A:middle
start receiving the samples in

00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:52.336 A:middle
real time and encoding them and

00:18:52.336 --> 00:18:53.376 A:middle
uploading to your servers.

00:18:56.056 --> 00:18:57.806 A:middle
So once a broadcast is running

00:18:57.806 --> 00:19:02.066 A:middle
now ReplayKit will provide raw
