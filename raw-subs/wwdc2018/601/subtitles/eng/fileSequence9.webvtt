00:08:59.426 --> 00:09:02.956 A:middle
But at the same time we had a

00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:05.616 A:middle
lot of feedback that people are

00:09:05.676 --> 00:09:07.226 A:middle
having hard time finding this

00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:08.866 A:middle
broadcast UI in the Control

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:11.686 A:middle
Center so we wanted to make it

00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:14.296 A:middle
easy for you to edit right into

00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:15.536 A:middle
your app.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:17.746 A:middle
And this year our goal was to

00:09:17.746 --> 00:09:19.466 A:middle
allow you integrate iOS system

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:21.406 A:middle
broadcast into your application,

00:09:21.576 --> 00:09:23.156 A:middle
and we are very excited to

00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:24.856 A:middle
announce System Broadcast

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:24.976 A:middle
Picker.

00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:30.636 A:middle
So let me go back to my diagram.

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:36.056 A:middle
So what we added now is sort of

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:38.826 A:middle
a hybrid approach to last two

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:39.546 A:middle
[inaudible] styles.

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:43.996 A:middle
And in this hybrid approach we

00:09:43.996 --> 00:09:46.056 A:middle
edit up the ability for your

00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:48.166 A:middle
application to also be initiator

00:09:48.436 --> 00:09:49.626 A:middle
of iOS system broadcast.

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:52.406 A:middle
So your app now can do the same

00:09:52.406 --> 00:09:54.146 A:middle
thing as what Control Center is

00:09:54.146 --> 00:09:57.196 A:middle
doing; start the broadcast and

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.416 A:middle
then allow it to continue as you

00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:01.636 A:middle
move from one app to another and
