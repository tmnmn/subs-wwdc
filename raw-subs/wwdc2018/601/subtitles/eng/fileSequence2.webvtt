00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:03.436 A:middle
In this session today I'm going

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:05.726 A:middle
to talk about the live broadcast

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:07.246 A:middle
functionality of ReplayKit and

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:08.826 A:middle
we're going to start with

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.666 A:middle
overview and talk about

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:12.546 A:middle
[inaudible] broadcast and iOS

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.936 A:middle
system broadcast, and then we

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.666 A:middle
are going to talk about the new

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.826 A:middle
API called System Broadcast

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:19.216 A:middle
Picker.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:22.136 A:middle
Now, this is an API that allows

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.856 A:middle
you to initiate the broadcast

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:25.496 A:middle
directly from your broadcast

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:26.246 A:middle
application.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.576 A:middle
After that we're going to

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:31.526 A:middle
discuss how you can actually

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.936 A:middle
implement the broadcast

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.456 A:middle
extensions and how that would

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.906 A:middle
work for you with the new API

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:39.126 A:middle
that [inaudible].

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:40.796 A:middle
Also, we're going to talk about

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:43.606 A:middle
the protecting of the content of

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:44.666 A:middle
your applications from being

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:44.976 A:middle
captured.

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:50.336 A:middle
So let's start with overview of

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.156 A:middle
the live broadcast.

00:02:53.916 --> 00:02:56.816 A:middle
As I said, ReplayKit allows you

00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.556 A:middle
to broadcast your app screen,

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
audio and audio content to
