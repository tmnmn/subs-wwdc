00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:02.926 A:middle
You would probably like to set

00:13:02.926 --> 00:13:03.906 A:middle
the property right after

00:13:03.906 --> 00:13:05.756 A:middle
correcting the view, and the

00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:06.906 A:middle
only difference from that

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:08.606 A:middle
example would be that you need

00:13:08.606 --> 00:13:11.116 A:middle
to replace the string called

00:13:11.116 --> 00:13:12.686 A:middle
com.your-app.broadcast.

00:13:12.686 --> 00:13:13.316 A:middle
extension.

00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:14.836 A:middle
It's a bundle idea of your

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:15.356 A:middle
extension.

00:13:15.926 --> 00:13:20.536 A:middle
So here's a diagram, and I just

00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:23.676 A:middle
want to emphasize the point

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:24.986 A:middle
about the picker view that you

00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:26.286 A:middle
create in your app.

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:28.766 A:middle
So that view is just a shortcut

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.716 A:middle
that brings up a system UI of

00:13:30.716 --> 00:13:32.546 A:middle
the broadcast picker, the same

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:34.586 A:middle
UI that you can access using the

00:13:34.586 --> 00:13:35.446 A:middle
Control Center.

00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:39.256 A:middle
And the picker itself belongs to

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:41.156 A:middle
the system and your application

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.096 A:middle
does not own any part of the

00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:46.786 A:middle
broadcast state and also cannot

00:13:47.236 --> 00:13:49.036 A:middle
start or stop the system

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:49.976 A:middle
broadcast programmatically.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.136 A:middle
So this is what you need to do

00:13:56.326 --> 00:13:58.326 A:middle
to add the iOS system broadcast

00:13:58.326 --> 00:13:59.296 A:middle
to your app.

00:13:59.436 --> 00:14:01.136 A:middle
There's a new API and it is
