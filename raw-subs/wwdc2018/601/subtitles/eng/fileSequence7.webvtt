play, or if you tap on one of

00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:04.296 A:middle
the [inaudible] of broadcast

00:07:04.296 --> 00:07:05.996 A:middle
providers, it will stream out to

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:06.766 A:middle
their service.

00:07:08.436 --> 00:07:10.026 A:middle
So once you have done that,

00:07:10.056 --> 00:07:12.606 A:middle
you're back to your game and now

00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:13.366 A:middle
you're streaming to that

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:13.956 A:middle
service.

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:16.146 A:middle
The broadcast extension receives

00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:17.896 A:middle
the media samples captured from

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.076 A:middle
the screen and uploads the video

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:21.756 A:middle
stream to its back end and the

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:23.726 A:middle
viewers they have in their web

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.936 A:middle
browsers, or however they want

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:29.616 A:middle
to use that stream, are watching

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.946 A:middle
your broadcast on their own

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:31.976 A:middle
devices around the world.

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:38.836 A:middle
This is how you start the iOS

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:39.936 A:middle
system broadcast.

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:41.906 A:middle
And now, what's interesting

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
about this kind of broadcast

00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:45.416 A:middle
again, is that, as I said, it

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:46.666 A:middle
continues regardless of you

00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:49.466 A:middle
moving from one app to another.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:52.446 A:middle
So I'm broadcasting from my home

00:07:52.446 --> 00:07:54.326 A:middle
screen here and then my home

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:55.426 A:middle
screen is what is being

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:55.996 A:middle
broadcasted.

00:07:56.486 --> 00:07:59.096 A:middle
And then if I'm launching a

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:01.516 A:middle
