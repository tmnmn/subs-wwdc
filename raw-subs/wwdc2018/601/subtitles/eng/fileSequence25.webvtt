00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:00.906 A:middle
the screen so the viewers could

00:25:01.276 --> 00:25:03.726 A:middle
find your broadcast.

00:25:05.016 --> 00:25:06.896 A:middle
And so just one more point I

00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:08.476 A:middle
would like to discuss today.

00:25:10.136 --> 00:25:12.726 A:middle
This is protecting content of

00:25:12.726 --> 00:25:13.546 A:middle
your applications.

00:25:14.816 --> 00:25:17.116 A:middle
So your app may display some

00:25:17.286 --> 00:25:18.736 A:middle
content that you don't want to

00:25:18.736 --> 00:25:21.526 A:middle
be captured in screen recording

00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:23.076 A:middle
or live broadcasts.

00:25:24.186 --> 00:25:26.436 A:middle
That applies to both audio and

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:28.296 A:middle
visual content.

00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:31.616 A:middle
There's an API that you can use

00:25:31.616 --> 00:25:33.796 A:middle
to tell if your content is being

00:25:33.796 --> 00:25:35.926 A:middle
captured and that API is

00:25:35.926 --> 00:25:38.926 A:middle
provided UIKit framework and I'm

00:25:38.926 --> 00:25:40.476 A:middle
talking about the property of

00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:42.706 A:middle
UIScreen called Captured.

00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:45.496 A:middle
So you can register to receive

00:25:45.496 --> 00:25:47.416 A:middle
notifications whenever the value

00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:50.056 A:middle
of this property is changed and

00:25:50.226 --> 00:25:52.166 A:middle
stop your audio playback or hide

00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.796 A:middle
the visual content when

00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:55.606 A:middle
recording starts.

00:25:56.796 --> 00:25:58.726 A:middle
There's also a special case that

00:25:58.726 --> 00:26:00.556 A:middle
you need to take care of, which
