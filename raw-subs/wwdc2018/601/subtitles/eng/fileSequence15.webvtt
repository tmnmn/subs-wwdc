00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
So if you install Facebook, you

00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:02.076 A:middle
also install Facebook broadcast

00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:02.986 A:middle
extension.

00:15:04.216 --> 00:15:08.306 A:middle
And broadcast extension and the

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:10.466 A:middle
application are separate

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
binaries and each runs in its

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:16.266 A:middle
own process and those processes

00:15:16.676 --> 00:15:18.926 A:middle
are invoked directly by the user

00:15:19.186 --> 00:15:20.626 A:middle
and independently from each

00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:20.916 A:middle
other.

00:15:21.996 --> 00:15:23.706 A:middle
And typically you would use

00:15:23.706 --> 00:15:25.556 A:middle
application to allow user sign

00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:27.566 A:middle
in or sign up for your service.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:31.636 A:middle
And now for the apps that will

00:15:31.636 --> 00:15:33.476 A:middle
adopt the broadcast picker API,

00:15:33.636 --> 00:15:37.416 A:middle
you can also let user to type in

00:15:37.416 --> 00:15:38.966 A:middle
some message before posting this

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:40.726 A:middle
particular broadcast to his

00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:41.146 A:middle
Facebook.

00:15:41.626 --> 00:15:46.106 A:middle
And the broadcast extension,

00:15:47.266 --> 00:15:49.426 A:middle
that's all the actual work when

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:51.226 A:middle
everything required to start the

00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:53.376 A:middle
broadcast is already available.

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:57.336 A:middle
So again, the extension does the

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:59.836 A:middle
work of taking samples edited by

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:03.156 A:middle
ReplayKit, the raw samples of
