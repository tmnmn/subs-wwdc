00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:01.636 A:middle
move from one app to another and

00:10:02.016 --> 00:10:03.346 A:middle
then move to the home screen,

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:03.896 A:middle
and so on.

00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:06.226 A:middle
So as the user starts a

00:10:06.226 --> 00:10:08.136 A:middle
broadcast from your application,

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.116 A:middle
he can later go to the Control

00:10:10.116 --> 00:10:12.976 A:middle
Center and stop it from there or

00:10:13.276 --> 00:10:14.706 A:middle
vice versa; he could start from

00:10:14.706 --> 00:10:16.456 A:middle
the Control Center and then go

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:17.666 A:middle
to your app and tap the button

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:17.976 A:middle
that stops.

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:24.456 A:middle
So again, the System Broadcast

00:10:24.456 --> 00:10:27.906 A:middle
Picker allows users to start the

00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:29.966 A:middle
iOS system broadcast without

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:31.886 A:middle
leaving your application, and

00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:34.206 A:middle
this is just a simple button in

00:10:34.206 --> 00:10:36.116 A:middle
the view that we provide and

00:10:36.596 --> 00:10:38.476 A:middle
this is a new feature we are

00:10:38.476 --> 00:10:41.476 A:middle
enabling in iOS 12.

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:44.766 A:middle
Here is example of that.

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:46.586 A:middle
Here I have the sample app, Fox

00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:49.666 A:middle
2 and I edit app with button at

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.686 A:middle
the top.

00:10:51.846 --> 00:10:53.446 A:middle
So if I hit this Broadcast

00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:55.316 A:middle
Picker button, that's going to

00:10:55.316 --> 00:10:56.986 A:middle
bring up the same UI as you

00:10:56.986 --> 00:10:59.926 A:middle
would have seen if you would go

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.176 A:middle
to the Control Center.
