00:05:58.796 --> 00:06:00.416 A:middle
But really, what today's session

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.786 A:middle
is about is what we call iOS

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:03.726 A:middle
system broadcast.

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:05.276 A:middle
Now, this is, again, the

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:07.126 A:middle
broadcast of all your onscreen

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:09.726 A:middle
activity and all your sounds,

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:11.766 A:middle
and instead of being initiated

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.426 A:middle
from within your application and

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.246 A:middle
starting and stopping when the

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:19.326 A:middle
app is paused, for example, this

00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:21.596 A:middle
session is started and stopped

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:23.386 A:middle
within Control Center, and this

00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:25.056 A:middle
is systemwide and it runs

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:27.076 A:middle
continuously as the user moves

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:28.476 A:middle
from the home screen to the app

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:30.696 A:middle
or as they move from one app to

00:06:30.696 --> 00:06:31.076 A:middle
another.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.916 A:middle
And all of this is built into

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.196 A:middle
iOS 11 and above and this is

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:37.966 A:middle
what was introduced last year as

00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:38.826 A:middle
ReplayKit 2.

00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:42.376 A:middle
So here's some game and you're

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.466 A:middle
playing a game and you want to

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:46.466 A:middle
start the live stream and

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:47.576 A:middle
initiate the broadcast.

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:50.646 A:middle
So you pull down the Control

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:52.196 A:middle
Center and say you touch into

00:06:52.196 --> 00:06:54.696 A:middle
that screen recording button and

00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:57.606 A:middle
that will bring up the picture

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.866 A:middle
for you to record your game

00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:02.776 A:middle
play, or if you tap on one of
