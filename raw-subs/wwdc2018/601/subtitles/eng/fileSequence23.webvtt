00:22:57.346 --> 00:23:00.066 A:middle
show you how you can handle this

00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:02.106 A:middle
case.

00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:04.026 A:middle
ReplayKit provides an API that

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:06.096 A:middle
allows extension to communicate

00:23:06.096 --> 00:23:08.416 A:middle
to the user that broadcast

00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:10.496 A:middle
cannot be started and provide a

00:23:10.496 --> 00:23:12.006 A:middle
particular action required to

00:23:12.006 --> 00:23:12.816 A:middle
fix the problem.

00:23:13.316 --> 00:23:16.186 A:middle
And the way it works, the

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:19.116 A:middle
extension calls some API

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:20.886 A:middle
function and ReplayKit will

00:23:20.886 --> 00:23:22.866 A:middle
terminate the session and

00:23:22.906 --> 00:23:26.006 A:middle
present the user the alert that

00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:29.406 A:middle
will include the failure reason

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:31.486 A:middle
provided by the extension, and

00:23:31.486 --> 00:23:33.226 A:middle
in this example this error

00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:34.956 A:middle
message is from Mobcrush and it

00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:37.116 A:middle
says that user is not logged in.

00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:41.316 A:middle
So next is the user tabs at

00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:43.266 A:middle
bottom go to the application,

00:23:44.096 --> 00:23:45.976 A:middle
ReplayKit is launching your

00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:47.596 A:middle
application and what you need to

00:23:47.596 --> 00:23:49.576 A:middle
do there is handle this case in

00:23:49.576 --> 00:23:51.446 A:middle
some way, present the UI by user

00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:53.166 A:middle
will sign in or sign up, and the

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.706 A:middle
next time the broadcast will

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:55.246 A:middle
just work.

00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:59.566 A:middle
So we have this code sample for

00:23:59.686 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle
the broadcastStarted before, and
