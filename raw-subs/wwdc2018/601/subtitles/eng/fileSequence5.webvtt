00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:01.436 A:middle
captured live as you play in a

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:05.096 A:middle
game and your game is calling

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.726 A:middle
the ReplayKit API to start and

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:08.636 A:middle
stop the broadcast.

00:05:09.836 --> 00:05:12.076 A:middle
And it also presents as

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.766 A:middle
broadcast activity controller so

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.096 A:middle
that the user would pick the

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:16.566 A:middle
service.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:20.836 A:middle
And in line with that, the

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:22.696 A:middle
broadcast application is

00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:24.456 A:middle
providing you the broadcast

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:26.826 A:middle
extension which ReplayKit is

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.196 A:middle
working on behalf of that game

00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:31.696 A:middle
to sign users into the service

00:05:31.996 --> 00:05:33.816 A:middle
and upload the broadcast content

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:36.576 A:middle
live to their servers.

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:38.956 A:middle
That was our original way of

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:40.656 A:middle
using ReplayKit Live Broadcast

00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:43.516 A:middle
and we covered this before.

00:05:43.516 --> 00:05:44.756 A:middle
And in case your application

00:05:44.756 --> 00:05:45.756 A:middle
does need this fine [inaudible]

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:47.196 A:middle
control for starting and

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.626 A:middle
stopping the broadcast, for more

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.056 A:middle
information please find the

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:53.236 A:middle
session called Go Live with

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:56.576 A:middle
ReplayKit from a couple of years

00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:56.866 A:middle
ago.

00:05:58.796 --> 00:06:00.416 A:middle
But really, what today's session
