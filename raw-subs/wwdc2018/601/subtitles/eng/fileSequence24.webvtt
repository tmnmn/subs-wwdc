00:23:59.686 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle
the broadcastStarted before, and

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:03.466 A:middle
here I want to show you how do

00:24:03.466 --> 00:24:04.836 A:middle
you handle this case when user

00:24:04.836 --> 00:24:05.726 A:middle
is not logged in.

00:24:06.326 --> 00:24:07.946 A:middle
So there's a function called

00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:11.416 A:middle
finishBroadcastWithError, and

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.246 A:middle
what you need to do is provide

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:15.746 A:middle
the user info dictionary with a

00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:18.966 A:middle
failure reason and ReplayKit is

00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:20.916 A:middle
going to use that string and

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:22.346 A:middle
allow that is shown after the

00:24:22.346 --> 00:24:22.976 A:middle
session is stopped.

00:24:29.686 --> 00:24:34.246 A:middle
Okay. This is how you develop

00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:36.906 A:middle
the broadcast extension, and as

00:24:36.906 --> 00:24:39.076 A:middle
you see, the process is pretty

00:24:39.076 --> 00:24:39.726 A:middle
straightforward.

00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:42.736 A:middle
The application handles the

00:24:42.736 --> 00:24:44.786 A:middle
broadcast setup and then

00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:45.616 A:middle
communicates that info to the

00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:45.976 A:middle
extension.

00:24:50.366 --> 00:24:52.396 A:middle
And after that the session

00:24:52.396 --> 00:24:53.756 A:middle
starts and you receive and

00:24:53.756 --> 00:24:56.086 A:middle
encode the media samples.

00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.226 A:middle
And also, you can get

00:24:58.226 --> 00:24:59.696 A:middle
information about application on

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:00.906 A:middle
the screen so the viewers could
