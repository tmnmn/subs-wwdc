00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.336 A:middle
and begin providing it with

00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:02.256 A:middle
visuals and audio content from

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:04.216 A:middle
that application, and the

00:04:04.216 --> 00:04:06.216 A:middle
extension would encode the media

00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:07.766 A:middle
and stream to the servers and

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:10.106 A:middle
this is what we call In-App

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:10.766 A:middle
Broadcast.

00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:16.276 A:middle
And what was new with ReplayKit

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:19.906 A:middle
2 is that instead we have entire

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:20.966 A:middle
system in a pack being

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:21.625 A:middle
broadcasted.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:24.736 A:middle
And how this works is the user

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:26.256 A:middle
would initiate that broadcast

00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:28.266 A:middle
from within the Control Center.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.266 A:middle
So this is where they start and

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:31.196 A:middle
stop the broadcast.

00:04:31.196 --> 00:04:35.176 A:middle
And that begins a system wide

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:37.546 A:middle
ReplayKit 2 broadcast session

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:39.356 A:middle
and, thus, audio and video

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:40.556 A:middle
samples, again, go to the

00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:42.156 A:middle
extension and upload it to the

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:42.596 A:middle
servers.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.076 A:middle
And conceptually this is the

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.186 A:middle
difference between the two.

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:49.416 A:middle
And just to talk about the

00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:51.636 A:middle
In-App Broadcast in the

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:52.126 A:middle
beginning.

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:55.206 A:middle
In the In-App Broadcast this is

00:04:55.206 --> 00:04:56.786 A:middle
your app or your game that is

00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:59.006 A:middle
providing the content that is

00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:01.436 A:middle
captured live as you play in a
