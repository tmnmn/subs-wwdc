00:18:57.806 --> 00:19:02.066 A:middle
now ReplayKit will provide raw

00:19:02.066 --> 00:19:04.346 A:middle
audio and video samples and your

00:19:04.346 --> 00:19:06.046 A:middle
extension needs to encode it and

00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:08.146 A:middle
upload it to your video service

00:19:08.396 --> 00:19:09.966 A:middle
using whatever technology you

00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:10.736 A:middle
prefer to use.

00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:13.686 A:middle
ReplayKit provides your

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:15.406 A:middle
extension three types of the

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:19.456 A:middle
samples; samples with video

00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:20.576 A:middle
captured from the screen,

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:22.596 A:middle
samples with audio tapped from

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:25.586 A:middle
the application and samples with

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:27.236 A:middle
audio captured from the

00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:29.226 A:middle
microphone, and your extension

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:31.076 A:middle
will encode all of this and

00:19:31.126 --> 00:19:33.206 A:middle
upload to the service.

00:19:35.236 --> 00:19:37.016 A:middle
And all of those are going to

00:19:37.016 --> 00:19:38.976 A:middle
the extension and are handled by

00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:39.786 A:middle
the function called

00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:42.336 A:middle
processSampleBuffer.

00:19:42.986 --> 00:19:45.546 A:middle
This function receives a single

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:47.716 A:middle
CMSampleBuffer, as you see, and

00:19:47.716 --> 00:19:48.646 A:middle
the type of the buffer.

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:51.286 A:middle
And what it needs to do is to

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:52.576 A:middle
encode and upload the media

00:19:52.576 --> 00:19:54.556 A:middle
samples, and in this code

00:19:54.556 --> 00:19:56.096 A:middle
example we show you how you can

00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:58.026 A:middle
encode the video using the Video

00:19:58.026 --> 00:19:58.646 A:middle
Toolbox.

00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:02.066 A:middle
So we recommend using the Video
