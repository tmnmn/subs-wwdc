00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:03.756 A:middle
And ReplayKit also supports live

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:04.866 A:middle
broadcast.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.786 A:middle
For application generating

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:10.106 A:middle
content like games, ReplayKit

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:12.296 A:middle
provides tools that allow them

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:14.026 A:middle
to stream audio and visual

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:16.066 A:middle
content using [inaudible] and

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.116 A:middle
broadcast services.

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:19.616 A:middle
And for the broadcast

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.886 A:middle
applications ReplayKit provides

00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:23.566 A:middle
ability to receive that content

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.516 A:middle
captured from other applications

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:30.446 A:middle
or entire iOS and encode and

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:31.246 A:middle
stream to the servers directly

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:31.926 A:middle
from the same device.

00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:38.196 A:middle
ReplayKit delivers its content

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:40.466 A:middle
in high quality with lowest

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.566 A:middle
latency and very low performance

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.196 A:middle
overhead and better usage.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.656 A:middle
It also safeguards the user's

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.706 A:middle
privacy by asking for approval

00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:51.526 A:middle
before any recording or

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:53.376 A:middle
broadcast begins, and also

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:55.776 A:middle
showing a prominent indicator

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:56.796 A:middle
whenever content is being

00:01:56.796 --> 00:01:56.976 A:middle
captured.
