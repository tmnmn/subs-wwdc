00:20:59.256 --> 00:21:01.206 A:middle
ReplayKit provides API function

00:21:01.206 --> 00:21:03.386 A:middle
called broadcastAnnotatedWith

00:21:03.386 --> 00:21:05.616 A:middle
ApplicationInfo, and as soon as

00:21:05.616 --> 00:21:08.866 A:middle
a player starts his game Angry

00:21:08.866 --> 00:21:10.256 A:middle
Birds sends this example,

00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:12.266 A:middle
ReplayKit notifies your

00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:14.516 A:middle
extension that that has happened

00:21:14.846 --> 00:21:16.286 A:middle
and provides a dictionary with

00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:17.676 A:middle
details about the app that was

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:17.996 A:middle
started.

00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:23.556 A:middle
And as an example, you can use

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:25.306 A:middle
the key defined by ReplayKit

00:21:25.356 --> 00:21:28.366 A:middle
called RPApplicationInfoBundle

00:21:28.366 --> 00:21:31.146 A:middle
IdentifierKey and get the bundle

00:21:31.146 --> 00:21:32.936 A:middle
ID of that game and pass it as a

00:21:32.936 --> 00:21:34.476 A:middle
metadata to your stream.

00:21:39.976 --> 00:21:41.316 A:middle
When the user stops the

00:21:41.316 --> 00:21:43.156 A:middle
broadcast, one way or another,

00:21:44.296 --> 00:21:45.616 A:middle
ReplayKit is using function

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.936 A:middle
called broadcastFinished to

00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:49.296 A:middle
communicate to your extension

00:21:49.296 --> 00:21:50.736 A:middle
that broadcast session is over

00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:51.676 A:middle
and there will be no more

00:21:51.676 --> 00:21:53.756 A:middle
samples delivered to the

00:21:53.756 --> 00:21:54.486 A:middle
SampleHandler.

00:21:54.486 --> 00:21:57.086 A:middle
And in this function you would

00:21:57.086 --> 00:21:59.016 A:middle
probably like to finish

00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:00.986 A:middle
uploading your buffered video
