00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.136 A:middle
Let's navigate the students to a

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:01.986 A:middle
website.

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.136 A:middle
I hit Command-G to bring up the

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:04.946 A:middle
Navigate sheet.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.546 A:middle
Now, I could use my mouse to

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.246 A:middle
pick the site to go to here.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:09.816 A:middle
I could also use the arrow keys.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:11.966 A:middle
Let's open this great National

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.686 A:middle
Geographic kids' site.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.766 A:middle
So, all my student iPads are

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.716 A:middle
taken to this site.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.046 A:middle
And, I can even click this link

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:22.076 A:middle
to go to the same site in Safari

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:22.656 A:middle
on my Mac.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.596 A:middle
Now, while I'm browsing the

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
site, I might find something

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.616 A:middle
else I want to share with my

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:28.046 A:middle
students, like this cool Monarch

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:28.956 A:middle
butterfly page.

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:32.766 A:middle
I can click the Share toolbar

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.576 A:middle
item, choose to Share via

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:37.276 A:middle
AirDrop, and in the list my

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.686 A:middle
class, and any manual groups

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:39.716 A:middle
I've created will show up.

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:40.976 A:middle
So, I can share this page.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.626 A:middle
Another thing that I love about

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.926 A:middle
having Classroom on the Mac, is

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:56.216 A:middle
that it gives me a great way to

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:57.666 A:middle
keep my students on task.

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.116 A:middle
I can see what apps they're in

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
by looking at these icons next
