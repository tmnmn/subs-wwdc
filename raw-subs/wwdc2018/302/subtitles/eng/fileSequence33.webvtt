00:32:59.366 --> 00:33:01.136 A:middle
of room service, when they get a

00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:02.526 A:middle
hankering for pink champagne on

00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:04.406 A:middle
ice, or informing them about

00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:05.706 A:middle
options for exploring the area.

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:08.906 A:middle
You can also provide your guests

00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:09.706 A:middle
with great entertainment

00:33:09.706 --> 00:33:11.386 A:middle
options, when they're actually

00:33:11.386 --> 00:33:12.846 A:middle
spending time in your room, by

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:14.016 A:middle
installing App Store apps.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.976 A:middle
And, this is the time when I

00:33:16.976 --> 00:33:18.826 A:middle
would love to share a clip of my

00:33:18.826 --> 00:33:20.016 A:middle
favorite show, Game of Thrones,

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:21.166 A:middle
with you, but we don't have time

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.086 A:middle
for that right now.

00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:23.646 A:middle
So, assuming your guests

00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:25.246 A:middle
actually ever leave the room,

00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:27.296 A:middle
and take some photos, they can

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.526 A:middle
of course, use AirPlay to share

00:33:29.526 --> 00:33:31.466 A:middle
those photos, and display them

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:32.936 A:middle
on the big screen in the room

00:33:32.936 --> 00:33:33.806 A:middle
you've provided to them.

00:33:34.676 --> 00:33:36.996 A:middle
So, this is just one example of

00:33:36.996 --> 00:33:38.426 A:middle
what can now be done with Apple

00:33:38.426 --> 00:33:40.056 A:middle
TV by managing it remotely.

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.356 A:middle
But, of course, there are many

00:33:41.356 --> 00:33:42.556 A:middle
other types of businesses that

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:43.626 A:middle
could take advantage of these

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.396 A:middle
capabilities to provide amazing

00:33:45.396 --> 00:33:46.896 A:middle
experiences to their guests,

00:33:47.326 --> 00:33:48.356 A:middle
including integration with the

00:33:48.356 --> 00:33:49.706 A:middle
Apple devices they're already

00:33:49.706 --> 00:33:50.426 A:middle
bringing with them.

00:33:51.126 --> 00:33:52.096 A:middle
We look forward to seeing the

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.016 A:middle
fruits of your creativity, even

00:33:54.016 --> 00:33:55.246 A:middle
if it doesn't involve dragons.

00:33:56.756 --> 00:33:58.226 A:middle
So, that brings us to the end of

00:33:58.226 --> 00:33:59.336 A:middle
our tvOS section.

00:33:59.636 --> 00:34:02.186 A:middle
And, last but not least, macOS,
