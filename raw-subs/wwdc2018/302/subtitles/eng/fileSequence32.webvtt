features of the device

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:01.606 A:middle
management experience.

00:32:01.736 --> 00:32:02.976 A:middle
Being able to install App Store

00:32:02.976 --> 00:32:04.236 A:middle
apps on Apple TV.

00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:05.976 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:11.126 A:middle
And, being able to update to the

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:13.036 A:middle
latest version of tvOS via MDM

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:14.806 A:middle
command, just like another Apple

00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:14.976 A:middle
device.

Thank you.

00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:20.226 A:middle
And, we think that combining

00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:21.576 A:middle
these new features with some of

00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:23.466 A:middle
the features that we've added

00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:25.556 A:middle
over the past few releases, you

00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.856 A:middle
can do some amazing things with

00:32:26.856 --> 00:32:28.546 A:middle
Apple TV, on its own, and in

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.716 A:middle
combination with other Apple

00:32:29.716 --> 00:32:30.296 A:middle
devices.

00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:31.906 A:middle
Provide new experiences to your

00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:32.396 A:middle
guests.

00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:34.156 A:middle
So, to illustrate the

00:32:34.266 --> 00:32:35.956 A:middle
possibilities, I'd like to

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:37.336 A:middle
welcome you to the entirely

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:38.996 A:middle
fictional Hotel Cupertino.

00:32:39.926 --> 00:32:40.936 A:middle
Such a lovely place.

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:43.616 A:middle
Where each enrolled Apple TV is

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:45.286 A:middle
programmed to receive commands

00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:46.626 A:middle
from the hotel's MDM server.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.036 A:middle
For example, including updating

00:32:49.036 --> 00:32:49.976 A:middle
to the latest version of tvOS.

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:55.126 A:middle
And, installing a custom
