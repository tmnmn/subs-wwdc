00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:04.366 A:middle
I told you there were more

00:35:04.366 --> 00:35:05.176 A:middle
security topics.

00:35:05.276 --> 00:35:05.986 A:middle
Here's another one.

00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:08.186 A:middle
We want to strongly encourage

00:35:08.186 --> 00:35:09.386 A:middle
our MDM partners to take

00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:10.896 A:middle
advantage of this new capability

00:35:10.896 --> 00:35:13.296 A:middle
to make enterprise app manifest

00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:14.486 A:middle
delivery more secure.

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:17.136 A:middle
The transition is easy because

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:18.296 A:middle
we're continuing to support the

00:35:18.296 --> 00:35:20.106 A:middle
existing installApplication MDM

00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:21.396 A:middle
command to install enterprise

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.766 A:middle
apps, but we really want you to

00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:24.886 A:middle
switch to one of the new methods

00:35:24.886 --> 00:35:25.786 A:middle
using the new

00:35:25.786 --> 00:35:27.466 A:middle
installEnterpriseApplication

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:29.106 A:middle
command as soon as possible.

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:31.036 A:middle
There're two options.

00:35:31.246 --> 00:35:32.486 A:middle
You can either specify the

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:33.556 A:middle
manifest right within the

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:34.536 A:middle
command, inline.

00:35:35.506 --> 00:35:37.496 A:middle
Or, you can specify certs that

00:35:37.496 --> 00:35:39.056 A:middle
we'll use later to pin our

00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:41.146 A:middle
request to fetch the manifest.

00:35:43.396 --> 00:35:45.526 A:middle
Please read up about this, and

00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:47.496 A:middle
make the switch as soon as you

00:35:49.676 --> 00:35:49.786 A:middle
can.

00:35:50.006 --> 00:35:50.936 A:middle
Now, this is not actually a

00:35:50.936 --> 00:35:52.706 A:middle
change so much, because none of

00:35:52.706 --> 00:35:54.446 A:middle
these six payloads ever worked

00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:56.146 A:middle
to install in a system profile.

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:57.636 A:middle
But-- because they only make

00:35:57.636 --> 00:35:58.916 A:middle
sense in a user context.

00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
But, next year, we're going to
