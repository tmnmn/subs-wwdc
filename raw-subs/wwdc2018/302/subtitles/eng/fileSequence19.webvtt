00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
MDM solution can populate the UI

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:01.516 A:middle
presented to the admin.

00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:07.376 A:middle
It's in the MDM protocol guide.

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:09.126 A:middle
Alright. And, that brings us to

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:10.416 A:middle
the end of our common section.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.496 A:middle
And now, I'd like to talk about

00:19:11.496 --> 00:19:12.936 A:middle
some iOS-specific changes.

00:19:13.646 --> 00:19:14.806 A:middle
Again, starting with security.

00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:17.206 A:middle
Now, some of you may have heard

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:18.986 A:middle
about this change that we

00:19:19.276 --> 00:19:21.356 A:middle
started to make in iOS 11.3, and

00:19:21.356 --> 00:19:24.056 A:middle
now it's back in 11.4.1, and iOS

00:19:24.056 --> 00:19:24.376 A:middle
12.

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:25.836 A:middle
And, of course, we wanted to

00:19:25.836 --> 00:19:27.096 A:middle
make this manageable as well,

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:29.296 A:middle
beyond the switch that's in the

00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:30.916 A:middle
UI in iOS 12.

00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:33.206 A:middle
So, there's a new restriction

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:34.616 A:middle
that allows you to control this

00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:35.946 A:middle
feature, and whether USB

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.226 A:middle
accessories can still connect

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:38.496 A:middle
devices if they're locked.

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:41.316 A:middle
And, of course, Configurator

00:19:41.316 --> 00:19:42.996 A:middle
kind of relies on devices being

00:19:42.996 --> 00:19:44.856 A:middle
able to connect via USB, so we

00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:46.056 A:middle
have implemented a special

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:47.486 A:middle
behavior for those devices.

00:19:48.016 --> 00:19:49.216 A:middle
When Configurator prepares a

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.596 A:middle
device to supervise it, but not

00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:53.346 A:middle
enroll it in MDM, it will

00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:54.976 A:middle
automatically install a profile

00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:56.776 A:middle
that installs this restriction,

00:19:56.776 --> 00:19:58.566 A:middle
and allows those devices to

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
continue connecting to the Mac
