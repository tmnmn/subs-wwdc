Get the logs using Console, and

00:38:01.016 --> 00:38:01.996 A:middle
it's a lot simpler-- you can

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:02.956 A:middle
just filter for the Managed

00:38:02.956 --> 00:38:04.146 A:middle
Client process on the Mac.

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:05.956 A:middle
But, I also wanted to highlight

00:38:05.956 --> 00:38:07.416 A:middle
the profile's command line tool.

00:38:07.486 --> 00:38:08.726 A:middle
It's a Mac, we're got Terminal.

00:38:09.466 --> 00:38:10.436 A:middle
You can, of course, use it to

00:38:10.436 --> 00:38:12.686 A:middle
install and remove profiles, but

00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:14.076 A:middle
it also has some great features

00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:16.656 A:middle
for verifying your deployment.

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:18.936 A:middle
The first we added this spring,

00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:21.486 A:middle
allows you to verify whether the

00:38:21.486 --> 00:38:22.936 A:middle
enrollment is user-approved,

00:38:23.256 --> 00:38:24.756 A:middle
with the profile status command.

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.356 A:middle
And, new in macOS Mojave,

00:38:27.956 --> 00:38:29.536 A:middle
there's a validate command that

00:38:29.536 --> 00:38:32.386 A:middle
allows you to confirm, or tells

00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:34.886 A:middle
you any differences between the

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.536 A:middle
device enrollment profile in the

00:38:36.536 --> 00:38:38.046 A:middle
cloud, and what's actually

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.256 A:middle
configured on the device at that

00:38:39.256 --> 00:38:39.626 A:middle
moment.

00:38:39.946 --> 00:38:40.816 A:middle
So that you can more easily

00:38:40.816 --> 00:38:43.296 A:middle
detect when your change that you

00:38:43.466 --> 00:38:44.526 A:middle
know you've already made in the

00:38:44.526 --> 00:38:46.566 A:middle
cloud hasn't been reflected on

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.296 A:middle
the Mac yet, or the device has

00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:49.326 A:middle
become unconfigured.

00:38:49.926 --> 00:38:52.076 A:middle
So, that brings us to the end of

00:38:52.076 --> 00:38:53.186 A:middle
our content for today.

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:54.716 A:middle
And, I'd like to quickly sum up

00:38:55.026 --> 00:38:56.226 A:middle
some of the takeaways for the

00:38:56.226 --> 00:38:57.346 A:middle
different groups, and different

00:38:57.346 --> 00:38:58.316 A:middle
audiences for this talk.

00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:00.836 A:middle
Administrators, we hope you love
