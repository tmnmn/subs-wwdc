From the audacious goal of an

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.956 A:middle
Apple 2 in every school in 1978,

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:08.396 A:middle
to an iPad or MacBook in every

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:10.546 A:middle
student's hands in 2018.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.006 A:middle
But, it's even more important to

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.276 A:middle
consider how much has remained

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:15.916 A:middle
the same over those tumultuous

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:16.626 A:middle
40 years.

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:20.336 A:middle
Apple had a unique insight into

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.946 A:middle
how technology could inspire

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:23.086 A:middle
people and unleash their

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.146 A:middle
creative genius.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:26.536 A:middle
And, we believed technology

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:27.646 A:middle
could help teachers deliver

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:28.896 A:middle
unique and personalized

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:30.366 A:middle
experiences to all of their

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.076 A:middle
students.

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:33.236 A:middle
We have never stopped believing

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.926 A:middle
in this goal, and never stopped

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:36.586 A:middle
working hard to achieve it.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.756 A:middle
Over the years, we have created

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:40.896 A:middle
a number of tools to make it

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:42.346 A:middle
easier for schools to put Apple

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:43.936 A:middle
devices into the hands of each

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:44.786 A:middle
of their students.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:46.446 A:middle
And, I want to highlight one of

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:47.996 A:middle
those now.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:50.246 A:middle
Classroom is now two years old,

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.966 A:middle
and teachers really appreciate

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.046 A:middle
the power it puts at their

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.596 A:middle
fingertips to accelerate

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.656 A:middle
teaching and learning without

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.036 A:middle
technology getting in the way.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.166 A:middle
But, we want to provide our
