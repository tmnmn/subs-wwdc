00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.256 A:middle
you're using device enrollment

00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:02.306 A:middle
to provide a fresh experience

00:25:02.306 --> 00:25:03.636 A:middle
for each new guest using that

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.486 A:middle
particular iPad or other device.

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:08.216 A:middle
Thank you, Eric.

00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:12.406 A:middle
And, finally, due to macOS

00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:13.966 A:middle
server deprecation, we have

00:25:13.966 --> 00:25:15.336 A:middle
removed support for the macOS

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:16.956 A:middle
server account payload in iOS

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:17.336 A:middle
12.

00:25:17.786 --> 00:25:18.946 A:middle
If you're still using some of

00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:20.006 A:middle
those services as you're

00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:21.506 A:middle
transitioning to a new solution,

00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:23.846 A:middle
you can replace those account

00:25:23.846 --> 00:25:25.006 A:middle
configurations with normal

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:25.846 A:middle
account payloads.

00:25:26.586 --> 00:25:28.806 A:middle
Next, I'd like to give you a few

00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:30.516 A:middle
tips on troubleshooting issues

00:25:30.516 --> 00:25:31.876 A:middle
with delivering and executing

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:33.296 A:middle
MDM commands on enrolled iOS

00:25:33.296 --> 00:25:33.846 A:middle
devices.

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.076 A:middle
There are a number of logging

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.396 A:middle
profiles which you can obtain at

00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:38.206 A:middle
the link at the bottom of the

00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:38.716 A:middle
screen.

00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:40.496 A:middle
And, all of the URL's are going

00:25:40.496 --> 00:25:41.376 A:middle
to be available at the More

00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:42.636 A:middle
Information link, which will be

00:25:42.636 --> 00:25:43.766 A:middle
at the end of the session, so

00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:45.006 A:middle
you don't have to feverishly

00:25:45.006 --> 00:25:45.836 A:middle
copy those down.

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:48.306 A:middle
Depending on what type of a

00:25:48.306 --> 00:25:49.346 A:middle
problem you're investigation,

00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:51.006 A:middle
you can install either both the

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:52.576 A:middle
MDM and/or the Apple Push

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:54.626 A:middle
Notification service profiles.

00:25:55.286 --> 00:25:56.236 A:middle
Once you've reproduced the

00:25:56.236 --> 00:25:57.866 A:middle
problem, you can get those logs

00:25:57.986 --> 00:25:59.106 A:middle
using Console or Apple

00:25:59.106 --> 00:26:00.026 A:middle
Configurator 2.
