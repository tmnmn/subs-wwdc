00:21:58.596 --> 00:22:00.796 A:middle
and unmanaged apps and sharing

00:22:00.796 --> 00:22:03.086 A:middle
files and data between them is--

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.386 A:middle
behaves the way everyone would

00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:04.856 A:middle
expect.

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:07.346 A:middle
This included making the context

00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:09.076 A:middle
API respect the boundary in iOS

00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:09.856 A:middle
11.3.

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:11.606 A:middle
Which of course was exactly what

00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:13.496 A:middle
many customers wanted, but we

00:22:13.496 --> 00:22:15.536 A:middle
know that that did have some

00:22:15.686 --> 00:22:17.196 A:middle
challenges for some

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:18.076 A:middle
organizations that were

00:22:18.076 --> 00:22:19.616 A:middle
deploying in a specific way.

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:21.076 A:middle
And, I'd just like to make

00:22:21.076 --> 00:22:23.056 A:middle
clear, that if you are using

00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:24.786 A:middle
Managed Open In, and want a

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:26.676 A:middle
managed app to manage Contacts,

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:28.606 A:middle
you need to deploy that managed

00:22:28.606 --> 00:22:29.816 A:middle
Contacts source as a managed

00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:30.356 A:middle
source.

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.666 A:middle
Alright. Now, let's turn to some

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.336 A:middle
of the new settings we've been

00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:37.566 A:middle
adding in this year's software

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:38.036 A:middle
releases.

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:39.616 A:middle
A bunch of things we added in

00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:40.766 A:middle
iOS 11.3.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.776 A:middle
I already mentioned allow USB

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:44.826 A:middle
accessories while device is

00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:47.246 A:middle
locked restriction, completing

00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:49.646 A:middle
our set of restrictions to allow

00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:51.946 A:middle
you to get classroom behavior on

00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:53.406 A:middle
a supervised device, even if

00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:54.756 A:middle
it's a teacher-created class.

00:22:54.876 --> 00:22:57.276 A:middle
We'll talk a little bit more

00:22:57.276 --> 00:22:58.966 A:middle
about the remote pairing later

00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:00.176 A:middle
on in the tvOS section.
