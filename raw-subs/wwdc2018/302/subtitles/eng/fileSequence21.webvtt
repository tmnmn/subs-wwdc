00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
continue to allow you to use

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:02.366 A:middle
them until that device is wiped,

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:03.506 A:middle
allowing you to time your

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:05.476 A:middle
refresh more conveniently.

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.066 A:middle
Of course, any new device

00:21:07.216 --> 00:21:08.816 A:middle
configured, or if you wipe the

00:21:08.816 --> 00:21:09.696 A:middle
device and restore from a

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:11.076 A:middle
backup, they will get the new

00:21:11.076 --> 00:21:12.466 A:middle
behavior, where each of these

00:21:12.466 --> 00:21:14.086 A:middle
restrictions is only honored if

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.156 A:middle
the device is supervised.

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:16.456 A:middle
But, of course, if you're wiping

00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:17.506 A:middle
a device, that's a great

00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:18.536 A:middle
opportunity to go ahead and

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:19.586 A:middle
supervise it before you

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:20.786 A:middle
configure it again.

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:24.596 A:middle
Just to refresh your memory,

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:26.816 A:middle
this is the list with one minor

00:21:26.816 --> 00:21:28.146 A:middle
change that we took advantage of

00:21:28.146 --> 00:21:28.966 A:middle
the fact that we're giving you

00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:29.736 A:middle
one more year.

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:31.576 A:middle
That in fact, the three Siri

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:33.966 A:middle
restrictions should also only be

00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:35.396 A:middle
honored on supervised devices,

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:37.986 A:middle
so this is the list, and we

00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:39.436 A:middle
really mean it this time.

00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:40.386 A:middle
We're going to do it next year.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.106 A:middle
Be prepared.

00:21:44.456 --> 00:21:46.326 A:middle
Alright. Managed Open In, it's a

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:48.726 A:middle
great feature, most-- more used

00:21:48.726 --> 00:21:50.416 A:middle
in enterprises, and we've made a

00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:51.686 A:middle
number of improvements, both in

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:55.746 A:middle
iOS 11.3, and iOS 12, to make

00:21:55.746 --> 00:21:56.866 A:middle
sure that the boundary we've

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.466 A:middle
established between managed apps

00:21:58.596 --> 00:22:00.796 A:middle
and unmanaged apps and sharing
