00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.396 A:middle
I'm presented with this great

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:01.166 A:middle
Summary view.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:02.716 A:middle
I can see all the apps that my

00:07:02.716 --> 00:07:04.556 A:middle
students used during class, and

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:06.246 A:middle
for each app, a timeline of when

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.336 A:middle
they were in that app.

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.996 A:middle
I also see all the shared items,

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.186 A:middle
like the great bear photo.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:14.026 A:middle
And, for each student, I get a

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:15.796 A:middle
timeline of all the apps they

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:16.876 A:middle
were in, and when they were in

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
those apps.

00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:19.856 A:middle
So, that's Classroom for Mac.

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:21.756 A:middle
We think with drag and drop,

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:24.386 A:middle
keyboard navigation, toolbar

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:26.546 A:middle
items, the menus and the tear

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.576 A:middle
off inbox, the teachers are

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:28.786 A:middle
going to love the power and

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:30.256 A:middle
convenience of having Classroom

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:31.106 A:middle
on their Macs.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:34.016 A:middle
And, of course, any macOS Mojave

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.566 A:middle
app would not be complete

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:36.976 A:middle
without support for Dark Mode.

00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:43.146 A:middle
So, that's Classroom for Mac.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.626 A:middle
It's available in public beta

00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:46.366 A:middle
now, and from the App Store this

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:46.726 A:middle
fall.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:47.356 A:middle
Thank you.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:47.976 A:middle
Todd?

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:52.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, guys.

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:55.686 A:middle
Doesn't Classroom really look

00:07:55.686 --> 00:07:56.556 A:middle
great in Dark Mode?

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:57.806 A:middle
I think teachers are really

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:58.646 A:middle
going to appreciate having it

00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.676 A:middle
here, on their Macs.
