00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:01.306 A:middle
can check out the video of the

00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:02.696 A:middle
password and AutoFill session

00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:03.736 A:middle
which occurred earlier this

00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:03.996 A:middle
week.

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:08.146 A:middle
We added a new restriction to

00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:09.685 A:middle
prevent users from modifying the

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.326 A:middle
Bluetooth restriction last fall.

00:17:11.846 --> 00:17:13.226 A:middle
And, in the spring, we added a

00:17:13.226 --> 00:17:14.336 A:middle
new MDM command to actually be

00:17:14.336 --> 00:17:15.866 A:middle
able to set the value of that

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:16.256 A:middle
setting.

00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:17.896 A:middle
And, I'm even more pleased to

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:19.256 A:middle
let you know that it's not in

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.935 A:middle
Seed 1, but I saw the change go

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.776 A:middle
in yesterday, that this command

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:24.146 A:middle
will now work even if you have

00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:25.296 A:middle
that restriction in place.

00:17:25.736 --> 00:17:26.786 A:middle
And, we think this will be great

00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:29.546 A:middle
for schools deploying Classroom,

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.366 A:middle
and in other situations where

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.336 A:middle
you want to make sure that

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:33.796 A:middle
Bluetooth is enabled, or

00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:36.066 A:middle
disabled, as the case may be.

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.176 A:middle
Big customer request, we have

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:41.556 A:middle
enabled OAuth authentication for

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:42.856 A:middle
exchange accounts configured via

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:43.386 A:middle
profile.

00:17:44.156 --> 00:17:46.986 A:middle
That's in iOS 12, and in macOS

00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:47.316 A:middle
Mojave.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:50.256 A:middle
And, a really big one, managed

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:52.056 A:middle
software updates that we brought

00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:53.566 A:middle
to both OS's this spring.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.246 A:middle
Thank you.

00:17:55.496 --> 00:17:56.706 A:middle
One person's excited about that.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:59.376 A:middle
And when I talked-- just because

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.656 A:middle
I'm excited about it, talk a
