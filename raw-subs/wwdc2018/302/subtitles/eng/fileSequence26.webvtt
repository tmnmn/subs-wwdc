00:25:59.106 --> 00:26:00.026 A:middle
Configurator 2.

00:26:01.146 --> 00:26:02.696 A:middle
And then, look through the logs

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:04.386 A:middle
by process, depending on what

00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:05.096 A:middle
kind of a problem you're

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:05.796 A:middle
investigating.

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.666 A:middle
Whether you're looking at

00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:09.936 A:middle
communication, or connection

00:26:09.936 --> 00:26:10.656 A:middle
issues.

00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:13.466 A:middle
Installing profiles or apps, or

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:14.616 A:middle
working with Shared iPad.

00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:19.356 A:middle
Now, next I'd like to turn to

00:26:19.356 --> 00:26:20.586 A:middle
cover some topics that are a

00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:22.176 A:middle
particular interest to app

00:26:22.216 --> 00:26:23.306 A:middle
developers, who would like to

00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:24.406 A:middle
sell their apps to schools and

00:26:24.406 --> 00:26:24.936 A:middle
businesses.

00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:26.896 A:middle
Or, as I like to call it in

00:26:26.896 --> 00:26:28.096 A:middle
honor of the biggest fan of

00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:30.336 A:middle
initial iPhone, say it with me,

00:26:30.496 --> 00:26:31.576 A:middle
the developers, developers,

00:26:31.576 --> 00:26:32.576 A:middle
developers section.

00:26:34.996 --> 00:26:36.166 A:middle
I'll first cover some topics

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:37.556 A:middle
specific to education apps,

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
before continuing with some

00:26:38.986 --> 00:26:40.246 A:middle
topics for enterprise apps.

00:26:41.076 --> 00:26:43.536 A:middle
At our education event in

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:45.666 A:middle
Chicago in March, we announced a

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:46.986 A:middle
brand-new app for teachers

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:47.906 A:middle
called Schoolwork.

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:50.936 A:middle
Schoolwork allows teachers to

00:26:50.936 --> 00:26:52.456 A:middle
easily share content with their

00:26:52.456 --> 00:26:54.686 A:middle
students, leveraging the power

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:55.596 A:middle
of your apps.

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:58.766 A:middle
And then, they can view student

00:26:58.766 --> 00:26:59.956 A:middle
progress across all of their

00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.296 A:middle
work within those great apps.
