00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.166 A:middle
But, we want to provide our

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.536 A:middle
tools on whichever OS our

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:02.546 A:middle
customers choose.

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
So, we were excited to announce

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.596 A:middle
at our March education event,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.396 A:middle
that Classroom was coming to the

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:07.756 A:middle
Mac.

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:10.186 A:middle
And, it looks like this.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:12.816 A:middle
I think Classroom looks

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:13.926 A:middle
fantastic on the Mac.

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:15.426 A:middle
It has the same great feature

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.236 A:middle
set already available on iPad,

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:18.846 A:middle
plus some surprises.

00:02:19.636 --> 00:02:21.126 A:middle
But, instead of describing those

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:23.016 A:middle
to you, I'd like to invite Curt

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.676 A:middle
and Raheel up to actually show

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:25.086 A:middle
them to you.

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:25.176 A:middle
Guys?

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:31.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:32.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.036 A:middle
Team's been working hard to

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:35.186 A:middle
bring the great Classroom

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.616 A:middle
experience to the Mac, and we're

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:37.616 A:middle
thrilled to share it with you

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:37.966 A:middle
today.

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:40.056 A:middle
To get started, I can just go to

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:41.516 A:middle
Launchpad, and click on

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:41.976 A:middle
Classroom.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.606 A:middle
As you'd expect in a Mac app,

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.186 A:middle
all the actions in Classroom for

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:50.496 A:middle
Mac are available in the

00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.896 A:middle
toolbar, from menus, and with

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:53.906 A:middle
keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:56.186 A:middle
For example, I can hit Command-T

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.856 A:middle
to bring up my teacher info.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.546 A:middle
Oh, that photo's a bit much.
