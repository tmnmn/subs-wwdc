00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:03.826 A:middle
Want to, again, remind you about

00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:04.596 A:middle
shared iPad.

00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:06.486 A:middle
If you want your app to be used

00:29:06.486 --> 00:29:08.796 A:middle
in Shared iPad, need to make

00:29:08.796 --> 00:29:10.226 A:middle
sure that it doesn't depend on

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.756 A:middle
any data being available locally

00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:12.616 A:middle
on a new device.

00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:14.046 A:middle
When a student moves, and signs

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:15.486 A:middle
into a new Shared iPad.

00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:18.116 A:middle
Persist all of the app data to

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:19.376 A:middle
the cloud, whether that's our

00:29:19.376 --> 00:29:20.396 A:middle
cloud, or your cloud.

00:29:21.376 --> 00:29:22.366 A:middle
And, while we'd, of course,

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:23.706 A:middle
prefer that you test your app on

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:25.326 A:middle
a real Shared iPad, you can

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:27.886 A:middle
simulate this by deleting all

00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:29.756 A:middle
the local data, and then making

00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:30.836 A:middle
sure that your app still works

00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:31.076 A:middle
well.

00:29:33.876 --> 00:29:35.376 A:middle
Also like to encourage you to

00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.336 A:middle
adopt managed app configuration.

00:29:37.616 --> 00:29:38.276 A:middle
There are thousands of

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.136 A:middle
developers who have, and have

00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.096 A:middle
created a number of shared

00:29:41.096 --> 00:29:43.076 A:middle
schemas that can make it-- your

00:29:43.076 --> 00:29:44.306 A:middle
app much more friendly to

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:46.176 A:middle
education and enterprise, by

00:29:46.176 --> 00:29:47.516 A:middle
enabling them to create a

00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.956 A:middle
customized experience for their

00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.536 A:middle
employees or students, to

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.356 A:middle
customize the look of the app,

00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:56.706 A:middle
or to prepare some custom data

00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:58.176 A:middle
to warm up the app so they get

00:29:58.176 --> 00:29:59.516 A:middle
the right experience at first

00:29:59.516 --> 00:29:59.936 A:middle
launch.
