00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.816 A:middle
configured via rogue script.

00:37:02.296 --> 00:37:04.156 A:middle
The first example was the kernel

00:37:04.156 --> 00:37:05.366 A:middle
extension permissions.

00:37:05.436 --> 00:37:06.846 A:middle
And, we introduced this in

00:37:06.846 --> 00:37:09.426 A:middle
10.13.2, although user-approved

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:11.016 A:middle
MDM enrollments was not actually

00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:13.176 A:middle
required until 10.13.4.

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:15.796 A:middle
There will be more security

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:17.296 A:middle
features that will fall into

00:37:17.296 --> 00:37:17.986 A:middle
this group.

00:37:18.316 --> 00:37:19.456 A:middle
So, this is something that's

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:21.076 A:middle
going to be with us, and in

00:37:21.076 --> 00:37:22.226 A:middle
fact, next thing I want to talk

00:37:22.226 --> 00:37:23.316 A:middle
about also requires

00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:24.156 A:middle
user-approved MDM.

00:37:24.156 --> 00:37:26.386 A:middle
And, that's the additional

00:37:26.386 --> 00:37:28.696 A:middle
support we made for testing apps

00:37:28.736 --> 00:37:30.446 A:middle
for high stakes testing apps on

00:37:30.446 --> 00:37:32.256 A:middle
the Mac, so they can achieve the

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:33.406 A:middle
controlled environment that they

00:37:33.406 --> 00:37:33.936 A:middle
require.

00:37:35.596 --> 00:37:37.086 A:middle
That support requires both an

00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:39.506 A:middle
entitlement, as well as a Mac

00:37:39.506 --> 00:37:40.956 A:middle
which has a user-approved

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:41.396 A:middle
enrollment.

00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:46.076 A:middle
And, just like for iOS and tvOS,

00:37:46.076 --> 00:37:47.116 A:middle
I'd like to give you some tips

00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:48.626 A:middle
on troubleshooting issues with

00:37:48.626 --> 00:37:50.116 A:middle
communicating with enrolled

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:50.786 A:middle
devices.

00:37:52.126 --> 00:37:53.296 A:middle
Similarly, you can install the

00:37:53.296 --> 00:37:54.846 A:middle
right logging profile for a

00:37:54.846 --> 00:37:56.126 A:middle
managed client, or again, Apple

00:37:56.126 --> 00:37:57.456 A:middle
Push Notification service.

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:00.826 A:middle
Get the logs using Console, and
