00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.546 A:middle
Oh, that photo's a bit much.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.566 A:middle
Let's go with something a little

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.636 A:middle
more laid back.

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:05.726 A:middle
That's better.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:11.046 A:middle
I can hit Shift-Command-N to

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:12.806 A:middle
bring up a new Class sheet.

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.456 A:middle
We have all the great icons and

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:15.646 A:middle
colors that teachers use in

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:16.706 A:middle
Classroom for iPad.

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.286 A:middle
I have enough Classes for this

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:19.946 A:middle
demo, so I just hit Escape to

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:20.646 A:middle
dismiss that.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.976 A:middle
In the Classes view, I can drag

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:24.946 A:middle
and drop to rearrange my

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:25.436 A:middle
Classes.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.446 A:middle
And, I can just double-click to

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:29.426 A:middle
start a Class session.

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.706 A:middle
In a Class session, we have all

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.006 A:middle
the actions that teachers expect

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.316 A:middle
from Classroom for iPad.

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:36.426 A:middle
They're available in the

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:39.036 A:middle
toolbar, from the Actions menu,

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:40.456 A:middle
and of course, with keyboard

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:41.106 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:43.556 A:middle
And, because this is a Mac app,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.816 A:middle
and I'm demoing on a Mac, I can

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:47.226 A:middle
use QuickTime to show you what

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.496 A:middle
this looks like from a student's

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:49.096 A:middle
perspective.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.026 A:middle
So, now on your left, we have

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.666 A:middle
Classroom for Mac, and on the

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.646 A:middle
right, we have Raheel's student

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:57.006 A:middle
iPad.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.136 A:middle
Let's navigate the students to a
