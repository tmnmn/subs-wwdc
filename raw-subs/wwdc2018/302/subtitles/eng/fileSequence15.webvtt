00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:02.866 A:middle
So, next topic is security.

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:03.906 A:middle
There'll be number of these

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:04.926 A:middle
throughout today's session.

00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:06.416 A:middle
This is something that Bob

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:08.046 A:middle
talked about last year, that we

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.296 A:middle
were going to begin requiring

00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:10.916 A:middle
transport security this year.

00:15:11.206 --> 00:15:12.336 A:middle
And, in fact, we're going to do

00:15:12.336 --> 00:15:14.446 A:middle
that in both iOS and macOS this

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:14.636 A:middle
year.

00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:17.466 A:middle
Your SCEP server should make

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:19.076 A:middle
sure to advertise its

00:15:19.076 --> 00:15:20.686 A:middle
capabilities, so that we know

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.296 A:middle
what the highest level of

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.506 A:middle
security you support, and don't

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.386 A:middle
have to fall back to a lower

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:27.286 A:middle
security encryption algorithm.

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:30.966 A:middle
We stopped supporting DES last

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:31.206 A:middle
year.

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:33.146 A:middle
Definitely supports one of the

00:15:33.146 --> 00:15:35.326 A:middle
modern and much more secure

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:36.296 A:middle
algorithms.

00:15:37.906 --> 00:15:39.106 A:middle
This year, I also wanted to give

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:40.406 A:middle
you a note on how you can verify

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.496 A:middle
that your server is ready for

00:15:41.496 --> 00:15:43.116 A:middle
this transition as we roll out

00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:44.246 A:middle
the new versions of iOS and

00:15:44.246 --> 00:15:45.036 A:middle
macOS this year.

00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:48.796 A:middle
You can use NSCurl against each

00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:49.906 A:middle
of the URL's that your server

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:52.126 A:middle
supports, and verify that there

00:15:52.126 --> 00:15:53.156 A:middle
are no issues that the

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:54.466 A:middle
diagnostics find.

00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
Now, let's turn to the new

00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:59.596 A:middle
management controls, commands

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.256 A:middle
and settings.
