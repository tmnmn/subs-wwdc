00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
But, next year, we're going to

00:36:00.706 --> 00:36:02.546 A:middle
start treating installing any of

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:03.596 A:middle
these payloads in a system

00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:05.106 A:middle
profile as a hard failure.

00:36:05.466 --> 00:36:06.916 A:middle
So, you have some time to

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:07.926 A:middle
prepare for that, and make sure

00:36:07.926 --> 00:36:10.556 A:middle
you're not already doing that.

00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:12.086 A:middle
Now, let's talk about some of

00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.186 A:middle
the new things we've added in

00:36:14.186 --> 00:36:15.516 A:middle
this year's macOS releases.

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:17.886 A:middle
Big customer request, you can

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.916 A:middle
now mark generated private keys

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.376 A:middle
as not exportable, so the user

00:36:21.376 --> 00:36:22.556 A:middle
can't get access to them on

00:36:22.556 --> 00:36:22.816 A:middle
their Mac.

00:36:24.436 --> 00:36:25.876 A:middle
We added content caching last

00:36:25.876 --> 00:36:27.676 A:middle
fall in macOS High Sierra.

00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:28.976 A:middle
And now, you can configure it

00:36:28.976 --> 00:36:29.666 A:middle
via profile.

00:36:30.556 --> 00:36:31.726 A:middle
And, we've added a number of new

00:36:31.726 --> 00:36:33.176 A:middle
controls for managing how smart

00:36:33.176 --> 00:36:34.596 A:middle
cards are used on your

00:36:34.596 --> 00:36:35.606 A:middle
organization's Macs.

00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:35.836 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:36.046 --> 00:36:36.926 A:middle
Smart cards.

00:36:42.736 --> 00:36:44.296 A:middle
Last fall, we introduced a new

00:36:44.296 --> 00:36:46.696 A:middle
concept for enrollments on Macs

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:48.226 A:middle
called user-approved MDM.

00:36:49.636 --> 00:36:51.856 A:middle
And, this is to protect features

00:36:51.856 --> 00:36:53.056 A:middle
that should really only be

00:36:53.056 --> 00:36:53.876 A:middle
available on an

00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:55.646 A:middle
organization-owned Mac, and be

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:57.566 A:middle
tied to affirmative consent from

00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:59.426 A:middle
a user or an admin, and not

00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.816 A:middle
configured via rogue script.
