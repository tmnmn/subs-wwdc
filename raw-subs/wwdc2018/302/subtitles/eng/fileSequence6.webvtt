&gt;&gt; When a student shares an item

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.336 A:middle
with me, the Inbox button in my

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.696 A:middle
toolbar will light up to let me

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:05.856 A:middle
know that there's something new

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:06.166 A:middle
there.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.066 A:middle
And, I can click to see a list

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:08.936 A:middle
of shared items.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:11.706 A:middle
And, on the Mac, I can tear off

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.426 A:middle
this Inbox, and place it next to

00:06:13.426 --> 00:06:14.286 A:middle
my Classroom window.

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:15.206 A:middle
And, this is great, because I

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:16.366 A:middle
can get at the items that my

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:17.696 A:middle
students are sharing with me,

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.036 A:middle
while still keeping an eye on

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:19.936 A:middle
the class as a whole.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.706 A:middle
And, I can double-click to open

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:23.746 A:middle
any shared items.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:25.766 A:middle
Well, that's a great bear photo,

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:26.296 A:middle
Raheel.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:27.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I know, right?

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:28.826 A:middle
It's unbearably great.

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:28.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:34.176 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.326 A:middle
Besides Smart Groups, I can also

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:37.906 A:middle
create groups manually in

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:38.566 A:middle
Classroom.

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.596 A:middle
I'll hit Command-N to bring up

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:42.286 A:middle
the New Group sheet, enter a

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:45.416 A:middle
group name, and select the

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:46.426 A:middle
students to include.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.576 A:middle
Manual groups are a great way to

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:50.956 A:middle
get different groups of students

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:53.146 A:middle
started on different tasks.

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:55.896 A:middle
When I'm done with my class

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:58.136 A:middle
session, I can hit End Class.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.436 A:middle
That ends my session.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.396 A:middle
I'm presented with this great
