00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:00.846 A:middle
performance, to find out how you

00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
can achieve the best performance

00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:02.876 A:middle
on our platforms.

00:31:03.386 --> 00:31:05.506 A:middle
And, that brings us to the end

00:31:05.506 --> 00:31:06.826 A:middle
of our iOS-specific section.

00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:09.766 A:middle
So, following the pattern

00:31:09.766 --> 00:31:10.886 A:middle
established by this week's

00:31:10.886 --> 00:31:12.416 A:middle
keynote, let's turn next to

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:12.726 A:middle
tvOS.

00:31:13.836 --> 00:31:15.566 A:middle
Now, with tvOS, we, over the

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:17.296 A:middle
past number of years and

00:31:17.296 --> 00:31:18.526 A:middle
releases have been playing a

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:19.446 A:middle
little bit of catch up and

00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:20.326 A:middle
adding some of the great

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:21.766 A:middle
features for device management

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:23.416 A:middle
that we had previously had for

00:31:23.516 --> 00:31:24.466 A:middle
iOS and macOS.

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.256 A:middle
And, I'm very pleased to let you

00:31:26.256 --> 00:31:27.376 A:middle
know that we continued to do

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:28.016 A:middle
that this year.

00:31:28.816 --> 00:31:30.696 A:middle
This spring, adding the ability

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:31.806 A:middle
to configure content

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.116 A:middle
restrictions, just like you can

00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:34.366 A:middle
on iOS and macOS.

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:38.266 A:middle
And, enabling you to lock down

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:40.396 A:middle
which app, or which devices, can

00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:41.916 A:middle
use the Remote app to manage a

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:43.036 A:middle
particular Apple TV.

00:31:43.446 --> 00:31:44.616 A:middle
This is great in the classroom,

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:46.066 A:middle
so that the teacher can just

00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:47.496 A:middle
have the Remote app on her

00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:49.886 A:middle
phone, and you cannot need a

00:31:49.886 --> 00:31:51.076 A:middle
physical remote in the

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:51.616 A:middle
classroom.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:53.946 A:middle
No student would ever get up to

00:31:53.946 --> 00:31:54.956 A:middle
no good with one of those.

00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.186 A:middle
And, perhaps, even more

00:31:58.186 --> 00:31:59.746 A:middle
important, some great key

00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
features of the device
