00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.746 A:middle
should handle both enrolling

00:14:00.746 --> 00:14:02.516 A:middle
devices, as well as ongoing

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.476 A:middle
communication with each of those

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.716 A:middle
enrolled devices, starting with

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.496 A:middle
Apple Push Notification service.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.926 A:middle
So, if your MDM solution is

00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
still using the Legacy Binary

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:15.216 A:middle
Provider API, we definitely want

00:14:15.216 --> 00:14:16.676 A:middle
you to adopt the new, modern,

00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:18.896 A:middle
HTTP/2 API, which is far more

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:19.836 A:middle
capable and efficient.

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:21.856 A:middle
You can read all about it in the

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:23.486 A:middle
Communicating with APNs section

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:24.986 A:middle
of the Networking documentation.

00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:26.926 A:middle
And, since I brought up

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.306 A:middle
documentation, I wanted to take

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:30.736 A:middle
a moment here to calm the waters

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:33.226 A:middle
about the MDM and Profile

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:34.016 A:middle
documentation.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.146 A:middle
The documentation team is going

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:37.096 A:middle
through a publishing tools

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:39.176 A:middle
transition, and the disclaimer

00:14:39.176 --> 00:14:40.056 A:middle
that you might have noticed

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:41.076 A:middle
looking at the documentation

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:42.566 A:middle
this week is not an indication

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.096 A:middle
of any change in commitment to

00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:45.106 A:middle
providing up-to-date

00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:46.706 A:middle
documentation for all these

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:47.376 A:middle
technologies.

00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:49.536 A:middle
In fact, the only reason you saw

00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:50.596 A:middle
that disclaimer is because we

00:14:50.596 --> 00:14:52.456 A:middle
did update both guides on Monday

00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:54.336 A:middle
for both the MDM protocol, and

00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:55.486 A:middle
the Configuration Profile

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:57.356 A:middle
reference to cover the changes

00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:59.746 A:middle
I'm going to talk about today.
