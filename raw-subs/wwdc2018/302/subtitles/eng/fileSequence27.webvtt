00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.296 A:middle
work within those great apps.

00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:03.356 A:middle
Helping them to tailor

00:27:03.356 --> 00:27:04.806 A:middle
instruction to the needs of each

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:05.676 A:middle
of their students.

00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:08.686 A:middle
And, also allowing them to

00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:10.126 A:middle
collaborate and provide instant

00:27:10.126 --> 00:27:11.466 A:middle
feedback on what their students

00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:13.396 A:middle
are learning quickly, and where

00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:14.206 A:middle
they might need a bit more

00:27:14.206 --> 00:27:14.666 A:middle
support.

00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:17.956 A:middle
Now, all of this is based upon a

00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:19.316 A:middle
new framework called ClassKit.

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:21.806 A:middle
And, that's where you come in.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.726 A:middle
Apps which adopt ClassKit

00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:25.106 A:middle
integrate with Schoolwork in

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:26.466 A:middle
order to help teachers discover

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:27.726 A:middle
assignable activities within

00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:29.686 A:middle
your app, to take students

00:27:29.686 --> 00:27:31.236 A:middle
directly to the right activity

00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:32.316 A:middle
for what they're supposed to be

00:27:32.316 --> 00:27:32.946 A:middle
working on.

00:27:33.636 --> 00:27:34.616 A:middle
And, most importantly to

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:36.376 A:middle
securely and privately share

00:27:36.376 --> 00:27:38.136 A:middle
that progress data as they work

00:27:38.136 --> 00:27:39.726 A:middle
through those tasks with their

00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:40.326 A:middle
teachers.

00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:42.416 A:middle
Now, they had a session

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:43.486 A:middle
yesterday, and I encourage you

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:44.496 A:middle
to watch their video.

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:47.106 A:middle
Alright. While I have,

00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:48.456 A:middle
hopefully, your attention, I'll,

00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:49.766 A:middle
you know-- MDM developers are

00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.546 A:middle
developers too, so this is

00:27:51.646 --> 00:27:52.556 A:middle
really more for them.

00:27:52.946 --> 00:27:54.116 A:middle
But, I wanted to make sure I

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.146 A:middle
kept their attention.

00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:56.316 A:middle
They didn't start tuning me out.

00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.506 A:middle
So, the Roster API is how MDM

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:01.226 A:middle
servers can get class
