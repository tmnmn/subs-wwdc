00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
continue connecting to the Mac

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
running Configurator.

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:07.186 A:middle
Alright. Another topic which is

00:20:07.186 --> 00:20:08.326 A:middle
not new, we've talked about it

00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:10.076 A:middle
for a number of years, last year

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:10.686 A:middle
Prodop [assumed spelling] told

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.266 A:middle
you that we are going to start

00:20:12.776 --> 00:20:14.226 A:middle
honoring the certain set of

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:15.746 A:middle
restrictions which were created

00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:17.366 A:middle
before supervision existed, but

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:18.736 A:middle
really should only be honored on

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:19.876 A:middle
supervised devices.

00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:21.886 A:middle
I want to make clear that these

00:20:21.886 --> 00:20:23.356 A:middle
restrictions are not going away.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.366 A:middle
They're still going to be

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:27.086 A:middle
usable, but they will only be

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.886 A:middle
honored on supervised devices.

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.156 A:middle
But, after hearing your

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:33.716 A:middle
feedback, we decided to delay

00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:35.226 A:middle
one more year, and we'll make

00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:36.516 A:middle
this change next year to help

00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:37.926 A:middle
make a smooth transition.

00:20:38.396 --> 00:20:39.366 A:middle
And, we've also come up with an

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:40.786 A:middle
upgrade and migration policy

00:20:40.786 --> 00:20:41.746 A:middle
that we think will further

00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:43.086 A:middle
smooth this transition.

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:46.236 A:middle
Essentially, if a device which

00:20:46.236 --> 00:20:48.446 A:middle
is not supervised has one or

00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:49.716 A:middle
more of these restrictions in

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.576 A:middle
place, they will continue to be

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:53.896 A:middle
honored even after upgrading to

00:20:53.896 --> 00:20:55.966 A:middle
the iOS version that includes

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:57.666 A:middle
this change until they're wiped.

00:20:58.846 --> 00:20:59.876 A:middle
So, we'll remember, and we'll

00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
continue to allow you to use
