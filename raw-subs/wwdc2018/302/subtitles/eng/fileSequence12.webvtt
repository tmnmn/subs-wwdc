00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.666 A:middle
But, we didn't stop there.

00:12:01.176 --> 00:12:02.406 A:middle
I'm very excited to announce

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
that in fact, this summer we're

00:12:03.816 --> 00:12:05.556 A:middle
also going to expand into 31

00:12:05.556 --> 00:12:06.936 A:middle
more countries around the world,

00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:09.226 A:middle
bringing us to 65 with support

00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:10.726 A:middle
for Apple School Manager and now

00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:11.786 A:middle
Apple Business Manager.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:14.206 A:middle
We're also adding book support

00:12:14.206 --> 00:12:16.116 A:middle
in Canada and Germany, which

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.616 A:middle
currently only support apps.

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.796 A:middle
So, I know the map looks great.

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:22.346 A:middle
You can kind of see where the

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:23.516 A:middle
expansion was, but I thought it

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:24.726 A:middle
would be much easier to actually

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:25.916 A:middle
see a list of countries, so you

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:28.456 A:middle
can see if your country will now

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.406 A:middle
have support for Apple School

00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:30.376 A:middle
Manager and Apple Business

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:30.806 A:middle
Manager.

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.876 A:middle
And, one thing I noticed,

00:12:32.876 --> 00:12:33.636 A:middle
looking at this list of

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:35.406 A:middle
countries-- this is a World Cup

00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:36.766 A:middle
year-- that seven of these

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
countries actually have a team

00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:40.086 A:middle
in the World Cup, unlike, sadly,

00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:42.236 A:middle
my country, United States, but

00:12:42.236 --> 00:12:43.496 A:middle
that means I'm in the market for

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.026 A:middle
a new team.

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:44.976 A:middle
So, go Iceland.

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:49.636 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.286 A:middle
I wanted to tell you also about

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:52.596 A:middle
another expansion of one of our

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:54.096 A:middle
deployment program features.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:56.276 A:middle
You can add credit to your

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.206 A:middle
account via purchase order to

00:12:58.206 --> 00:12:59.396 A:middle
allow you then to purchase apps

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
and books later.
