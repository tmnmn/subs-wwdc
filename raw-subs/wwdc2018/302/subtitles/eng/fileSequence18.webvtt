00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.656 A:middle
I'm excited about it, talk a

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:01.776 A:middle
little bit more in detail.

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:02.936 A:middle
It consists of two different

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:04.786 A:middle
restrictions, one to enable the

00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:06.286 A:middle
feature in the first place, to

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.436 A:middle
put the device so that it will

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:09.826 A:middle
delay when the user will see a

00:18:09.826 --> 00:18:11.216 A:middle
new update once we release it.

00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.456 A:middle
And, an optional parameter that

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:14.436 A:middle
you can configure the delay

00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:16.816 A:middle
period from 1 day to up to 90

00:18:16.816 --> 00:18:17.276 A:middle
days.

00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.586 A:middle
If you don't specify that

00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:22.426 A:middle
setting, it defaults to 30 days.

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:25.466 A:middle
The scheduleOSUpdate command has

00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:26.746 A:middle
been supported on both platforms

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.696 A:middle
for a long time, and on macOS,

00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:29.666 A:middle
it's always allowed you to

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:30.896 A:middle
specify which update you

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.336 A:middle
actually wanted to install on

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:32.626 A:middle
that Mac.

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:35.286 A:middle
But, in iOS 12-- I'm sorry, this

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.626 A:middle
spring, in iOS, we added the

00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:39.106 A:middle
ability to specify a version

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:41.436 A:middle
number for just the iOS version

00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:42.456 A:middle
that you have tested with all

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.716 A:middle
the software important for your

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:45.006 A:middle
organization's devices.

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:47.356 A:middle
Wq also added a new Apple

00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:49.036 A:middle
software lookup service, so that

00:18:49.036 --> 00:18:50.976 A:middle
your MDM server can look up the

00:18:50.976 --> 00:18:52.536 A:middle
eligible versions for a

00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:53.766 A:middle
particular device at a

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:54.576 A:middle
particular time.

00:18:55.096 --> 00:18:56.996 A:middle
And, we have documented that API

00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:58.806 A:middle
to look that up, so that your

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.426 A:middle
MDM solution can populate the UI
