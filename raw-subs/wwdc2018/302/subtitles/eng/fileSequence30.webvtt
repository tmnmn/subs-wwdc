00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:04.206 A:middle
Here's the URL for the site to

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:04.956 A:middle
learn all about it.

00:30:04.956 --> 00:30:06.946 A:middle
Again, that will be available on

00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:08.536 A:middle
the More Information page later

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:08.816 A:middle
on.

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:12.146 A:middle
We also have a number of great

00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:13.456 A:middle
enterprise partners, who've

00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:16.216 A:middle
provided SDK's to make the power

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:17.666 A:middle
of their services available to

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:18.426 A:middle
your apps.

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:21.606 A:middle
From IBM's Watson to allow you

00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.326 A:middle
to do machine-learning models,

00:30:23.456 --> 00:30:26.746 A:middle
and we have great pages on our

00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:28.266 A:middle
developer.apple.com website.

00:30:28.266 --> 00:30:29.206 A:middle
They're really hard to figure

00:30:29.206 --> 00:30:30.716 A:middle
out, because they're slash and

00:30:30.716 --> 00:30:31.546 A:middle
then the company name.

00:30:31.626 --> 00:30:33.246 A:middle
But, I encourage you to check

00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:34.366 A:middle
those out, and see what you can

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:35.356 A:middle
do within your apps.

00:30:35.896 --> 00:30:39.626 A:middle
And, finally if your app depends

00:30:39.626 --> 00:30:41.636 A:middle
on network performance, for some

00:30:41.636 --> 00:30:42.996 A:middle
time now, we've enabled you to

00:30:42.996 --> 00:30:45.396 A:middle
configure that with profiles for

00:30:45.396 --> 00:30:46.956 A:middle
enterprise apps and MDM

00:30:46.956 --> 00:30:47.586 A:middle
solutions.

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:49.606 A:middle
But, this year we've added a

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.226 A:middle
number of new quality of service

00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:52.486 A:middle
keys to allow you to fine-tune

00:30:52.486 --> 00:30:53.276 A:middle
it even further.

00:30:54.506 --> 00:30:55.816 A:middle
Encourage you to check out the

00:30:55.886 --> 00:30:58.586 A:middle
networking session, if your app

00:30:58.586 --> 00:30:59.806 A:middle
is sensitive to network

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:00.846 A:middle
performance, to find out how you
