00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.256 A:middle
and settings.

00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:01.686 A:middle
And, I'd like to start, again,

00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:02.576 A:middle
with everything that's supported

00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:04.066 A:middle
on two or more of our OS's.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.766 A:middle
You may have heard about some of

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:08.806 A:middle
the new password features that

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:10.316 A:middle
we're introducing in this fall's

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.146 A:middle
iOS and macOS releases.

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:13.376 A:middle
And, of course, we want to

00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:15.046 A:middle
enable you to manage them, via

00:16:15.046 --> 00:16:15.626 A:middle
profile.

00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:17.896 A:middle
So, the great new automatic

00:16:17.896 --> 00:16:19.766 A:middle
strong passwords and AutoFill

00:16:19.766 --> 00:16:21.416 A:middle
features within Safari and

00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:23.086 A:middle
within apps, we have a new

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.616 A:middle
password AutoFill restriction

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:27.366 A:middle
that also covers the existing

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:28.606 A:middle
Safari AutoFill feature and

00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:29.176 A:middle
restriction.

00:16:30.346 --> 00:16:32.016 A:middle
We've also added a new password

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:34.066 A:middle
sharing restriction that covers

00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:35.936 A:middle
all versions of the password

00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:37.476 A:middle
sharing feature, including the

00:16:37.476 --> 00:16:39.156 A:middle
previous WiFi password sharing.

00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:40.936 A:middle
And, this restriction prevents

00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:42.306 A:middle
you from sharing your password

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:42.996 A:middle
with others.

00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:45.376 A:middle
The last bullet on the slide,

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.856 A:middle
password proximity requests.

00:16:47.416 --> 00:16:49.106 A:middle
This restriction actually is

00:16:49.106 --> 00:16:50.536 A:middle
supported on tvOS as well,

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:52.646 A:middle
because this feature, or this

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:54.436 A:middle
restriction, prevents your

00:16:54.436 --> 00:16:56.016 A:middle
device asking others for their

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.566 A:middle
password.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.236 A:middle
And, if you didn't attend, you

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:01.306 A:middle
can check out the video of the
