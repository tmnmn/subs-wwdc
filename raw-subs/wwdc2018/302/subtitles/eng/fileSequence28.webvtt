00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:01.226 A:middle
servers can get class

00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:02.656 A:middle
information from Apple School

00:28:02.656 --> 00:28:03.156 A:middle
Manager.

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:06.096 A:middle
And, we have had this class name

00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:06.916 A:middle
field for a while.

00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:08.346 A:middle
And, we want to encourage you to

00:28:08.346 --> 00:28:10.176 A:middle
use that as a display name in

00:28:10.176 --> 00:28:12.036 A:middle
your MDM console, as well as

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:13.526 A:middle
what you pass along to Classroom

00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:15.096 A:middle
via the education payload, the

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:16.456 A:middle
configure managed classes.

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:18.146 A:middle
This is because Schoolwork is

00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:19.656 A:middle
using that field, and we'd like

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:20.686 A:middle
to achieve a consistent

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:21.986 A:middle
experience for teachers using

00:28:21.986 --> 00:28:22.676 A:middle
both apps.

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:24.516 A:middle
The reason you might not be

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:26.086 A:middle
already doing this, is because

00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:27.916 A:middle
of class name's history.

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:31.056 A:middle
Before January, it was there in

00:28:31.056 --> 00:28:32.326 A:middle
the API, but we actually didn't

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:33.006 A:middle
return a value.

00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:35.926 A:middle
In January, we began returning a

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:37.236 A:middle
value that was derived using

00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:39.006 A:middle
logic in Apple School Manager.

00:28:39.606 --> 00:28:41.976 A:middle
But, this month, we're going to

00:28:41.976 --> 00:28:43.296 A:middle
start allowing administrators to

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:45.036 A:middle
configure that name based on how

00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:46.756 A:middle
the school names their classes,

00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:47.956 A:middle
and what the teacher will expect

00:28:48.616 --> 00:28:49.436 A:middle
right within Apple School

00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:49.876 A:middle
Manager.

00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:51.656 A:middle
So, again, if you're not

00:28:51.656 --> 00:28:52.756 A:middle
currently using that to

00:28:52.756 --> 00:28:54.136 A:middle
configure the education payload

00:28:54.136 --> 00:28:56.586 A:middle
for Classroom, please start, so

00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:57.706 A:middle
we can achieve that great

00:28:57.706 --> 00:28:58.806 A:middle
experience for teachers.

00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:03.826 A:middle
Want to, again, remind you about
