00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
by looking at these icons next

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:01.516 A:middle
to their avatars.

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:03.536 A:middle
And, through these Smart Groups

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:05.646 A:middle
that show what students are in

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:07.106 A:middle
each app.

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:08.766 A:middle
It looks like Raheel's getting

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
distracted.

00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:11.956 A:middle
Brooklyn and Ella are still in

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:13.706 A:middle
Safari, but it looks like

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.266 A:middle
Raheel's browsing the App Store.

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:16.756 A:middle
So, I can use another cool

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:17.796 A:middle
feature of Classroom.

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:19.606 A:middle
If I double-click on Raheel's

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.296 A:middle
avatar, I can see his iPad

00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:23.806 A:middle
screen on my Mac.

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.006 A:middle
And, while I'm looking at a

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.126 A:middle
student's screen, I can perform

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.916 A:middle
actions on just that student's

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:29.226 A:middle
iPad.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.226 A:middle
So, in the Actions menu, I can

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.516 A:middle
choose Open App, and then

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:35.326 A:middle
Safari, and click Open, to bring

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:35.976 A:middle
Raheel back on task.

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:43.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Students can share links and

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.706 A:middle
files from their iPads to the

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:47.316 A:middle
teacher, too.

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:49.466 A:middle
For example, I can share an

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.726 A:middle
image from Photos, like this

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:52.856 A:middle
great bear picture I found.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.696 A:middle
All I have to do is tap the

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.426 A:middle
Share button, and then tap

00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:57.786 A:middle
Doctor C in AirDrop to share.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:01.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When a student shares an item
