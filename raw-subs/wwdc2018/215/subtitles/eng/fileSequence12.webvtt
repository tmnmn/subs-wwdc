00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:00.966 A:middle
It's usually useful to use this

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:02.346 A:middle
when your contexts are

00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:04.586 A:middle
downloaded on demand to -- when

00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:05.946 A:middle
all of your context is not

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:07.656 A:middle
available, so you want to create

00:12:07.656 --> 00:12:08.356 A:middle
things on demand.

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:10.926 A:middle
The way it works is that as we

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:13.176 A:middle
start querying for a path, for

00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:14.716 A:middle
our contexts among the path, if

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:17.696 A:middle
you don't find a context on that

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:20.426 A:middle
path, we will call the Create

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:22.116 A:middle
Context for Identifier Method

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.396 A:middle
under Delegate that you've

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.186 A:middle
defined, giving you a chance to

00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:26.396 A:middle
create the missing context.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:28.706 A:middle
And if you do create a context,

00:12:29.106 --> 00:12:30.626 A:middle
we will take the context and go

00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:31.986 A:middle
add it to the correct place on

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:33.286 A:middle
the tree for you.

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:37.806 A:middle
So, as I mentioned, it's useful

00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:38.996 A:middle
for app for -- with dynamic

00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:39.386 A:middle
content.

00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:40.956 A:middle
Let's actually take a look at

00:12:40.956 --> 00:12:42.236 A:middle
how this work in action.

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:44.386 A:middle
Again, we have the same

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:46.386 A:middle
identifier path, but in this

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:47.996 A:middle
case, our tree is incomplete.

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:51.246 A:middle
And we also have a delegate.

00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:53.406 A:middle
So again, we will visit the App

00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:54.256 A:middle
Context.

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:56.416 A:middle
Then we'll visit the Book

00:12:56.416 --> 00:12:56.826 A:middle
Context.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.676 A:middle
Then we are going to try to

00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:02.586 A:middle
visit the Chapter 2 Context, but
