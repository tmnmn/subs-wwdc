00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:01.266 A:middle
Then, we're going to make sure

00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:02.766 A:middle
that we call our same published

00:31:02.766 --> 00:31:05.346 A:middle
context function, and that so,

00:31:05.346 --> 00:31:06.816 A:middle
if the context has not been

00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:08.196 A:middle
created, we'll make sure to

00:31:08.196 --> 00:31:09.066 A:middle
create them.

00:31:09.756 --> 00:31:11.246 A:middle
This will return an optional

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:12.676 A:middle
error, and we'll make sure to

00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:14.266 A:middle
handle any errors.

00:31:14.816 --> 00:31:16.416 A:middle
Then, we're just going to sync

00:31:16.486 --> 00:31:17.746 A:middle
back up with our main thread and

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:20.806 A:middle
instantiate our storyboard and

00:31:20.806 --> 00:31:22.596 A:middle
also instantiate the correct

00:31:22.596 --> 00:31:24.216 A:middle
view controllers for this quiz.

00:31:25.296 --> 00:31:26.766 A:middle
Then we're going to set our quiz

00:31:26.766 --> 00:31:28.926 A:middle
on our view controller, and push

00:31:28.926 --> 00:31:30.036 A:middle
on the appropriate views.

00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:33.166 A:middle
So, now let's go ahead and run

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.906 A:middle
this code and test that our

00:31:34.906 --> 00:31:36.146 A:middle
deep-linking is working.

00:31:36.706 --> 00:31:38.116 A:middle
So, I'm going to switch back to

00:31:38.116 --> 00:31:40.046 A:middle
my device, and then we're going

00:31:40.046 --> 00:31:41.336 A:middle
to navigate back to the

00:31:41.336 --> 00:31:42.606 A:middle
Schoolwork app.

00:31:43.936 --> 00:31:46.296 A:middle
Here, let's tap on the icon one

00:31:46.296 --> 00:31:46.866 A:middle
more time.

00:31:48.186 --> 00:31:50.286 A:middle
Awesome. It launched us straight

00:31:50.286 --> 00:31:51.946 A:middle
into the addition math quiz.

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:53.636 A:middle
So, now we're ready to start

00:31:53.636 --> 00:31:55.466 A:middle
writing our user generated

00:31:55.466 --> 00:31:56.076 A:middle
activity data.

00:31:56.746 --> 00:31:58.356 A:middle
So, let's go back to XCode, and

00:31:58.356 --> 00:31:59.766 A:middle
let's navigate to the part of

00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:01.576 A:middle
our code that gets called when a
