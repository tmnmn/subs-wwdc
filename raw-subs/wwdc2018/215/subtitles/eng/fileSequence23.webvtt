00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.636 A:middle
piece of information that both

00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:03.456 A:middle
students and teachers will have

00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:05.406 A:middle
to know what this context

00:23:05.726 --> 00:23:06.416 A:middle
represents.

00:23:07.736 --> 00:23:09.136 A:middle
We also want to define our

00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:11.366 A:middle
context as early as possible.

00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:13.806 A:middle
For our sample app, we have

00:23:13.946 --> 00:23:14.696 A:middle
static content.

00:23:15.296 --> 00:23:16.966 A:middle
And so, we'll know what context

00:23:16.966 --> 00:23:18.486 A:middle
to write as soon as the app

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:19.176 A:middle
launches.

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:20.836 A:middle
So, that's when we'll define

00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:21.706 A:middle
ours.

00:23:22.666 --> 00:23:24.926 A:middle
Now, we might also want to

00:23:24.926 --> 00:23:26.586 A:middle
always display our context in a

00:23:26.586 --> 00:23:28.286 A:middle
particular order for teachers

00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:29.416 A:middle
that makes sense.

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:31.886 A:middle
So, for our sample app, that

00:23:31.886 --> 00:23:33.876 A:middle
might mean our addition context

00:23:34.016 --> 00:23:35.046 A:middle
should probably also be

00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:37.096 A:middle
displayed above the

00:23:37.096 --> 00:23:38.486 A:middle
multiplication context.

00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:40.446 A:middle
So, to do that, we'll take

00:23:40.446 --> 00:23:42.236 A:middle
advantage of the Display Order

00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:44.036 A:middle
Property that lives on CLS

00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:44.636 A:middle
Context.

00:23:45.256 --> 00:23:47.656 A:middle
Now that we've determined what

00:23:47.656 --> 00:23:49.386 A:middle
type of context data we're going

00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:50.416 A:middle
to write, let's talk about the

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:52.016 A:middle
student generated activity.

00:23:52.546 --> 00:23:55.326 A:middle
Here, I have a screenshot of the

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:57.246 A:middle
Schoolwork App, and this is a

00:23:57.366 --> 00:23:59.656 A:middle
sample of what some activity

00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:00.786 A:middle
data might look like.
