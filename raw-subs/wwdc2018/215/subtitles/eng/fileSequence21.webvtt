00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:00.906 A:middle
And if we did that, we would end

00:21:00.906 --> 00:21:02.226 A:middle
up with a structure that looks

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:02.936 A:middle
something like this.

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:06.006 A:middle
At the top level, we have our

00:21:06.006 --> 00:21:07.636 A:middle
main app context, which is our

00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:08.796 A:middle
Quizzler app.

00:21:09.246 --> 00:21:11.256 A:middle
Beneath that, we have our

00:21:11.256 --> 00:21:12.776 A:middle
Addition Context and a

00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:13.986 A:middle
Multiplication Context.

00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:15.966 A:middle
And then beneath each one of

00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:17.886 A:middle
those, we have the Scoreboard

00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:20.316 A:middle
Context and then the actual Quiz

00:21:20.316 --> 00:21:20.866 A:middle
Context.

00:21:21.866 --> 00:21:24.846 A:middle
Now, Pavel told us that a

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:26.836 A:middle
context is a part of our

00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:29.156 A:middle
application that a teacher will

00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:30.376 A:middle
assign to their students.

00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:32.406 A:middle
So, if we keep that in mind,

00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:33.986 A:middle
let's first talk about the

00:21:33.986 --> 00:21:34.926 A:middle
Scoreboard Context.

00:21:36.146 --> 00:21:39.376 A:middle
Well, what is the Scoreboard

00:21:39.376 --> 00:21:39.876 A:middle
Context?

00:21:40.476 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
It's all the users' high scores.

00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:44.726 A:middle
Now, does that really make sense

00:21:45.076 --> 00:21:46.846 A:middle
for a teacher to assign to their

00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:47.426 A:middle
students?

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:49.766 A:middle
Not really.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:51.416 A:middle
So, we're going to go ahead and

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:52.566 A:middle
remove that.

00:21:53.056 --> 00:21:54.296 A:middle
Now, we're left with a structure

00:21:54.436 --> 00:21:55.416 A:middle
that looks something like this.

00:21:56.646 --> 00:21:58.636 A:middle
So, next let's focus on the

00:21:58.636 --> 00:21:59.566 A:middle
Addition Context.
