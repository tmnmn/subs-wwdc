00:24:57.936 --> 00:25:00.576 A:middle
and create CLS Binary Items and

00:25:01.706 --> 00:25:03.436 A:middle
we'll add each one of those as

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:05.686 A:middle
an additional activity item on

00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:06.316 A:middle
our activity.

00:25:07.156 --> 00:25:08.876 A:middle
So, now that we've determined

00:25:08.876 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
what type of ClassKit close

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:12.096 A:middle
we're going to write, let's go

00:25:12.566 --> 00:25:14.486 A:middle
ahead and see what that actually

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:19.746 A:middle
looks like in action.

00:25:20.466 --> 00:25:21.686 A:middle
So here, I'm mirroring my

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.696 A:middle
display for you and have Xcode

00:25:23.696 --> 00:25:24.266 A:middle
on screen.

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.236 A:middle
The first thing that I'm going

00:25:26.236 --> 00:25:28.706 A:middle
to do is select my project's

00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:29.046 A:middle
target.

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:31.306 A:middle
Once I do that, I'm going to

00:25:31.306 --> 00:25:33.196 A:middle
select the Capabilities Pane,

00:25:33.586 --> 00:25:34.766 A:middle
and we're going to find the

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:36.386 A:middle
ClassKit APIs right here.

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:38.846 A:middle
Then, all we need to do is make

00:25:38.846 --> 00:25:40.806 A:middle
sure that we toggle that on, and

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.326 A:middle
we're all set to start writing

00:25:42.326 --> 00:25:43.396 A:middle
some ClassKit code.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.176 A:middle
So, first we're going to write

00:25:46.176 --> 00:25:48.006 A:middle
our context and we said that we

00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:49.596 A:middle
could do that as soon as the app

00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:50.136 A:middle
launches.

00:25:50.736 --> 00:25:52.326 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and open up

00:25:52.376 --> 00:25:53.266 A:middle
the App Delegate.

00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:56.206 A:middle
And in here, let's go ahead and

00:25:56.276 --> 00:25:57.786 A:middle
create a function that will

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.186 A:middle
publish our context for us.
