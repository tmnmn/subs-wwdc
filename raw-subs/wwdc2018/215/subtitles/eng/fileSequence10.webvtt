00:09:59.276 --> 00:10:00.746 A:middle
To find Section 1, we will first

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:02.216 A:middle
visit the App Context.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.216 A:middle
Then we'll visit the Book

00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:04.806 A:middle
Context.

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:05.986 A:middle
We will find the [inaudible] of

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:07.536 A:middle
the Book Context with Identifier

00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:08.116 A:middle
Chapter 2.

00:10:08.116 --> 00:10:10.266 A:middle
We will visit that one, and we

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:11.586 A:middle
will do the same for Section 1.

00:10:12.586 --> 00:10:14.196 A:middle
Since Section 1 is the last

00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:15.946 A:middle
thing on our path, then this is

00:10:15.946 --> 00:10:18.236 A:middle
what the path is referring to.

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:22.416 A:middle
So, we have a few ways to look

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:23.916 A:middle
up contexts with our system.

00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:26.396 A:middle
One is using absolute context

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:27.786 A:middle
paths, and to do that, you would

00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:30.226 A:middle
call the CLS Data Store Context

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:32.546 A:middle
Matching Identifier Path Method.

00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:36.036 A:middle
The completion block of this

00:10:36.116 --> 00:10:38.676 A:middle
method will return all contexts

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:39.396 A:middle
among the paths.

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:42.026 A:middle
So, for example, it will be an

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:43.796 A:middle
array of the Up Context, Book

00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:45.736 A:middle
Context, Chapter 2 Context, and

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:46.686 A:middle
Section 1 Context.

00:10:48.016 --> 00:10:49.546 A:middle
If for some reason, Chapter 2 in

00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:52.296 A:middle
Section 1 was missing, then that

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:53.736 A:middle
array in the completion block

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.956 A:middle
will just continue to Up Context

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:56.776 A:middle
and the Book Context.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:10:59.376 A:middle
And that gives you a chance to
