00:22:00.356 --> 00:22:01.886 A:middle
What is the Addition Context

00:22:01.886 --> 00:22:03.376 A:middle
within our application?

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:05.706 A:middle
Isn't it really just the

00:22:05.706 --> 00:22:06.566 A:middle
addition quiz?

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:08.706 A:middle
It's really just one thing.

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:09.626 A:middle
It's not two.

00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:11.406 A:middle
So, those really should be

00:22:11.406 --> 00:22:12.486 A:middle
combined into one.

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:14.246 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and do that

00:22:14.386 --> 00:22:16.166 A:middle
and then the same goes for the

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:17.466 A:middle
multiplication context.

00:22:18.246 --> 00:22:20.026 A:middle
Now, we're left with a structure

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:22.056 A:middle
that looks something like this.

00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:23.996 A:middle
Now, Pavel and I talked about

00:22:24.586 --> 00:22:26.856 A:middle
it, and we decided that we may

00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:29.776 A:middle
add a subtraction quiz and a

00:22:29.776 --> 00:22:31.146 A:middle
division quiz in the future.

00:22:31.146 --> 00:22:32.986 A:middle
And if we did that, we could

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.356 A:middle
easily add those as siblings.

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:37.586 A:middle
Now, when you all are thinking

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:39.056 A:middle
about which structure makes

00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.706 A:middle
sense for your applications,

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.146 A:middle
don't just think about your

00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:44.056 A:middle
current feature set, but also

00:22:44.056 --> 00:22:45.396 A:middle
consider what you might be doing

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:46.946 A:middle
in the future, and make sure

00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:48.456 A:middle
that your structure will easily

00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:49.776 A:middle
grow with you.

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.106 A:middle
So now, let's talk about the

00:22:52.106 --> 00:22:53.106 A:middle
context themselves.

00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:55.326 A:middle
We want to make sure that we

00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:57.546 A:middle
have clear titles, and that's

00:22:57.596 --> 00:22:59.846 A:middle
because the title is the one

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.636 A:middle
piece of information that both
