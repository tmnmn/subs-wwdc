00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.216 A:middle
So now, that context can start

00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.446 A:middle
recording progress data.

00:30:02.646 --> 00:30:03.876 A:middle
We can see that my handout

00:30:03.926 --> 00:30:05.616 A:middle
posted successfully, and I can

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:06.086 A:middle
tap on it.

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:08.276 A:middle
Here we see the context that

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:10.026 A:middle
I've added, and I see my nice,

00:30:10.026 --> 00:30:12.386 A:middle
app icon is right there next to

00:30:12.386 --> 00:30:13.306 A:middle
the context name.

00:30:14.006 --> 00:30:15.906 A:middle
If I tap on the icon, it should

00:30:15.906 --> 00:30:17.636 A:middle
navigate me straight into the

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:18.646 A:middle
addition math quiz.

00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:19.876 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and tap on

00:30:19.876 --> 00:30:19.976 A:middle
that.

00:30:21.456 --> 00:30:24.196 A:middle
Uh-oh. Schoolwork launched our

00:30:24.336 --> 00:30:25.276 A:middle
app, but this is not the

00:30:25.276 --> 00:30:26.316 A:middle
addition math quiz.

00:30:27.126 --> 00:30:28.026 A:middle
Oh, yes. That's right.

00:30:28.146 --> 00:30:28.986 A:middle
We forgot to add in

00:30:28.986 --> 00:30:29.686 A:middle
deep-linking.

00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:31.276 A:middle
So, let's go back to XCode and

00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:31.926 A:middle
add that in.

00:30:32.536 --> 00:30:33.866 A:middle
So, I'm going to go back to the

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:35.616 A:middle
App Delegate, and let's add in

00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:37.306 A:middle
that Continue Restoration

00:30:37.306 --> 00:30:37.986 A:middle
Handler.

00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:41.376 A:middle
So here, the Continue

00:30:41.376 --> 00:30:43.226 A:middle
Restoration Handler will process

00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:44.416 A:middle
some user activity.

00:30:45.336 --> 00:30:46.396 A:middle
We're just going to grab that

00:30:46.396 --> 00:30:48.166 A:middle
User Activity and get the

00:30:48.166 --> 00:30:49.556 A:middle
Context Identifier Path.

00:30:51.156 --> 00:30:52.816 A:middle
Once we have the Context Path,

00:30:53.436 --> 00:30:54.796 A:middle
we're going to instantiate our

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:56.906 A:middle
own internal quiz model that's

00:30:56.906 --> 00:30:58.736 A:middle
associated with this context.

00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:01.266 A:middle
Then, we're going to make sure
