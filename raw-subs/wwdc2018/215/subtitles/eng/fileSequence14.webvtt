00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.416 A:middle
receiver of the method.

00:14:02.136 --> 00:14:03.836 A:middle
If you would like to see if

00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:05.006 A:middle
there's currently an activity

00:14:05.006 --> 00:14:07.986 A:middle
associated with your context,

00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:09.706 A:middle
you can do so by querying for

00:14:09.706 --> 00:14:11.426 A:middle
the current activity property on

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:12.236 A:middle
the CLS Context.

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:15.996 A:middle
I'd like to mention that every

00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:16.996 A:middle
time you co-create a new

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:19.186 A:middle
activity, this is the same thing

00:14:19.256 --> 00:14:20.786 A:middle
as starting a new attempt at

00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:23.356 A:middle
that activity, meaning that a

00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:24.806 A:middle
teacher would receive a new

00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:26.246 A:middle
progress report.

00:14:26.886 --> 00:14:31.216 A:middle
Let's take a look at how would

00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:32.586 A:middle
you add progress to an activity.

00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.406 A:middle
One way is to directly set the

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:35.396 A:middle
progress property.

00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:38.296 A:middle
And that one is to add a

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:40.666 A:middle
progress range, from a start to

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:40.956 A:middle
an end.

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:43.646 A:middle
Also, know that setting the

00:14:43.646 --> 00:14:45.416 A:middle
progress property directly is

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.326 A:middle
the same thing as adding a

00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:48.776 A:middle
progress range for the start of

00:14:48.776 --> 00:14:49.016 A:middle
zero.

00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:52.816 A:middle
I'd like to also mention that

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:54.006 A:middle
it's perfectly fine for you to

00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:56.426 A:middle
add overlapping progresses

00:14:56.426 --> 00:14:57.906 A:middle
arranges or even the same

00:14:57.906 --> 00:14:58.976 A:middle
progress arranged multiple

00:14:59.006 --> 00:14:59.256 A:middle
times.
