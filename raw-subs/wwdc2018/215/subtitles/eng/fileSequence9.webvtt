00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:02.336 A:middle
identify contexts across

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:02.846 A:middle
siblings.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.916 A:middle
What I mean by this is that it's

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:07.286 A:middle
okay for you to have a context

00:09:07.286 --> 00:09:08.346 A:middle
with the same identifier,

00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:10.046 A:middle
multiple contexts with the same

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:11.736 A:middle
identifier, as long as they

00:09:11.736 --> 00:09:12.816 A:middle
don't have the same parent,

00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:14.416 A:middle
which will be fine.

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:17.506 A:middle
So, that [inaudible] is

00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:18.856 A:middle
something we call Context

00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
Identifier Path.

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:22.696 A:middle
Context Identifier Paths are

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:24.206 A:middle
what we actually use to uniquely

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:26.086 A:middle
identify context within the

00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
tree, within the context tree.

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.716 A:middle
And what Context Identifier

00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:32.186 A:middle
Paths are, well, it's just an

00:09:32.186 --> 00:09:33.476 A:middle
area of Context Identifiers.

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:35.986 A:middle
The way we use them is that we

00:09:36.436 --> 00:09:38.156 A:middle
traverse the Context [inaudible]

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:40.436 A:middle
following the path, until we

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:42.756 A:middle
reach a note there -- the last

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:45.356 A:middle
note within the path.

00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:46.726 A:middle
Let's actually take a walk how

00:09:46.726 --> 00:09:48.966 A:middle
this looks in action.

00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:51.556 A:middle
In this example, we have a

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:53.176 A:middle
context card that's pointing to

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.976 A:middle
Section 1 Context within some

00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:56.006 A:middle
chapter, within some book.

00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.536 A:middle
And we also have our Context

00:09:58.536 --> 00:09:58.666 A:middle
Tree.

00:09:59.276 --> 00:10:00.746 A:middle
To find Section 1, we will first
