00:27:59.296 --> 00:28:01.016 A:middle
code to test that our contexts

00:28:01.076 --> 00:28:01.986 A:middle
were actually created.

00:28:01.986 --> 00:28:04.646 A:middle
Here, I have a device and I'm

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:05.986 A:middle
mirroring my display for you.

00:28:06.976 --> 00:28:07.716 A:middle
So, awesome.

00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:09.336 A:middle
Our Quizzler app launched.

00:28:10.136 --> 00:28:12.086 A:middle
But everything looks the same.

00:28:12.846 --> 00:28:14.386 A:middle
So, how do we know that these

00:28:14.386 --> 00:28:16.286 A:middle
contexts were actually created?

00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:17.926 A:middle
Well, this is where we use

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.546 A:middle
Developer Mode and Schoolwork.

00:28:19.546 --> 00:28:20.956 A:middle
So, I'm going to hit the Home

00:28:20.956 --> 00:28:23.256 A:middle
button, and open up the settings

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:24.503 A:middle
up.

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:25.766 A:middle
Now, I'm going to scroll down

00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:26.646 A:middle
and I'm going to look for the

00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:27.416 A:middle
Developer Settings.

00:28:27.416 --> 00:28:29.716 A:middle
When I select the Developer

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:31.906 A:middle
Settings, I'm going to see some

00:28:31.906 --> 00:28:33.036 A:middle
ClassKit APIs.

00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:35.536 A:middle
If I select the ClassKit APIs,

00:28:35.836 --> 00:28:37.576 A:middle
we can see that we can switch

00:28:37.656 --> 00:28:38.796 A:middle
and act as the role of the

00:28:38.796 --> 00:28:39.246 A:middle
teacher.

00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:41.186 A:middle
So, I just make sure I select

00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:41.706 A:middle
that.

00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:43.656 A:middle
And now, we can hit the Home

00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:45.346 A:middle
button and open up the

00:28:45.346 --> 00:28:46.666 A:middle
Schoolwork app.

00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:49.706 A:middle
Now, when the Schoolwork app

00:28:49.706 --> 00:28:51.436 A:middle
launches, I first get a Welcome

00:28:51.436 --> 00:28:51.896 A:middle
screen.

00:28:52.226 --> 00:28:53.336 A:middle
I'll go ahead and dismiss that.

00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:55.166 A:middle
And then if we look in the top

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.626 A:middle
right-hand corner, I can see

00:28:56.626 --> 00:28:57.786 A:middle
that I have a plus button.

00:28:58.416 --> 00:28:59.526 A:middle
That's how I know that I'm

00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:00.516 A:middle
logged in as a teacher.
