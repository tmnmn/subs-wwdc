00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:00.786 A:middle
data might look like.

00:24:01.996 --> 00:24:03.486 A:middle
For our quiz, I think it

00:24:03.486 --> 00:24:05.176 A:middle
definitely makes sense to track

00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:06.916 A:middle
the total amount of time that a

00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:08.776 A:middle
student spends taking this quiz.

00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:11.556 A:middle
So, to do this, we can go ahead

00:24:11.556 --> 00:24:13.656 A:middle
and call the Start and Stop

00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:15.236 A:middle
Methods that live on CLS

00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:15.906 A:middle
Activity.

00:24:17.246 --> 00:24:19.316 A:middle
Now, it might also be nice to

00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:20.986 A:middle
show what the total score was

00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:22.086 A:middle
that the student received.

00:24:23.116 --> 00:24:24.846 A:middle
And if we think about it, the

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:27.746 A:middle
total score is probably the most

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:29.646 A:middle
important piece of information

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:30.996 A:middle
about this whole quiz.

00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:32.616 A:middle
So, we probably want to

00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:33.526 A:middle
highlight it within the

00:24:33.526 --> 00:24:35.446 A:middle
Schoolwork UI like we have here.

00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:37.916 A:middle
Well, to do this, we can go

00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:40.176 A:middle
ahead and create a CLS Score

00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:42.256 A:middle
Item, and then we'll set it as

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:44.086 A:middle
the primary activity item.

00:24:44.086 --> 00:24:45.286 A:middle
That way, it will get

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:47.906 A:middle
highlighted within the

00:24:48.436 --> 00:24:48.776 A:middle
Schoolwork UI.

00:24:48.776 --> 00:24:51.066 A:middle
Now, it might also be nice to

00:24:51.066 --> 00:24:52.586 A:middle
indicate whether an individual

00:24:52.586 --> 00:24:54.506 A:middle
question was correct or not.

00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:57.646 A:middle
So, to do this, we can go ahead

00:24:57.936 --> 00:25:00.576 A:middle
and create CLS Binary Items and
