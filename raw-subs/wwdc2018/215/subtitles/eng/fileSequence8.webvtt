00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.526 A:middle
context is exposed as a

00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:01.146 A:middle
property.

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:04.286 A:middle
And the Data Store also gives

00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.246 A:middle
tracks of all modified objects

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:06.876 A:middle
within the system.

00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:09.356 A:middle
So, if you'd like to save those

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:12.866 A:middle
object, you can call CLS Data

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:15.466 A:middle
Store, Save with Completion.

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:19.856 A:middle
I'd like to mention also that

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:21.876 A:middle
there is one shared instance of

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.296 A:middle
the Data Store that you use to

00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:24.076 A:middle
interact with.

00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:29.826 A:middle
So, next, let's talk about

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:30.926 A:middle
contexts.

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:34.346 A:middle
We saw that contexts are a three

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:37.126 A:middle
hierarchy, and Marin is actually

00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:38.456 A:middle
going to go in detail later

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:40.076 A:middle
about contexts, how to use them

00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.946 A:middle
and mention some interesting

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:44.135 A:middle
properties about them, but I'd

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:46.196 A:middle
like to concentrate on Context

00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:46.816 A:middle
Identity.

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:51.326 A:middle
So, identity of a context in

00:08:51.326 --> 00:08:52.576 A:middle
ClassKit is two things.

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:54.856 A:middle
The first one is the Identifier

00:08:54.856 --> 00:08:57.946 A:middle
Property, and the Identifier

00:08:57.946 --> 00:08:59.656 A:middle
Property allows you to uniquely

00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:02.336 A:middle
identify contexts across
