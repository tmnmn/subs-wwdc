00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:04.686 A:middle
context redefined for your app.

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:07.066 A:middle
And this acts as the root

00:05:07.136 --> 00:05:08.736 A:middle
context of the content tree --

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:09.866 A:middle
or the context tree.

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:12.516 A:middle
Also, all of your content is

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:14.356 A:middle
just a descendant of the main

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.106 A:middle
app context.

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:20.546 A:middle
So, we ask that you define your

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:23.236 A:middle
content as accurately as

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:24.926 A:middle
possible because the sooner you

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:26.336 A:middle
define your content, the sooner

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.016 A:middle
it will be available to teachers

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:31.776 A:middle
in Schoolwork to assign to

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:32.926 A:middle
students.

00:05:32.996 --> 00:05:34.096 A:middle
Assuming that you've created

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:36.076 A:middle
your context tree, a teacher

00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:37.186 A:middle
will be able to go to

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:39.386 A:middle
Schoolwork, they will be able to

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.976 A:middle
tap the Create New Handout

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:43.526 A:middle
button, which will create a new

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:44.436 A:middle
instance of a handout.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.646 A:middle
Then they will point the handout

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:49.096 A:middle
to a specific piece of content

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:50.946 A:middle
within your app, and once

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:51.776 A:middle
they've done that, they will

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:54.606 A:middle
assign the handout to a student.

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:56.816 A:middle
Once a student receives that

00:05:56.896 --> 00:05:59.246 A:middle
handout, they will then tap on

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.716 A:middle
the handout which will open your
