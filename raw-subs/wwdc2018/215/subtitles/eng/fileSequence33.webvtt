00:33:01.016 --> 00:33:02.536 A:middle
We also said that we wanted to

00:33:02.536 --> 00:33:03.916 A:middle
report the answer for an

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:05.116 A:middle
individual or question.

00:33:05.786 --> 00:33:06.876 A:middle
So, I'm going to navigate to the

00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:08.496 A:middle
part of my code that gets called

00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:09.866 A:middle
when a student taps on an

00:33:09.866 --> 00:33:10.236 A:middle
answer.

00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:14.376 A:middle
So here, what we're going to do,

00:33:14.816 --> 00:33:16.336 A:middle
is we're going to get that same

00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:17.786 A:middle
currently running activity that

00:33:17.786 --> 00:33:18.686 A:middle
we just created.

00:33:19.336 --> 00:33:20.906 A:middle
Once we have that, we'll

00:33:20.906 --> 00:33:23.886 A:middle
instantiate a CLS binary item,

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:26.286 A:middle
giving it a unique identifier,

00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:29.496 A:middle
and then a nice, clear title.

00:33:30.376 --> 00:33:31.536 A:middle
Then we'll make sure to pass in

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:33.266 A:middle
the type of binary item that

00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:34.576 A:middle
this is.

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:37.326 A:middle
Now, we're going to set the

00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:39.426 A:middle
value of whether the student got

00:33:39.426 --> 00:33:41.776 A:middle
this question correct or not.

00:33:42.936 --> 00:33:43.886 A:middle
Then we're going to add this

00:33:44.016 --> 00:33:46.356 A:middle
binary item as an additional

00:33:47.106 --> 00:33:49.266 A:middle
activity item on our currently

00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:50.096 A:middle
running activity.

00:33:51.186 --> 00:33:52.406 A:middle
The last thing that we said we

00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.576 A:middle
wanted to do, was stop the timer

00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:55.856 A:middle
and set the total score.

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:57.636 A:middle
So, we're going to navigate to

00:33:57.636 --> 00:33:59.106 A:middle
the part of our code that gets

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.366 A:middle
called when a student ends an
