00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:00.496 A:middle
test.

00:07:01.786 --> 00:07:02.866 A:middle
But with all that, we can

00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:04.826 A:middle
actually make this a little

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:07.486 A:middle
better and we created something

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:08.816 A:middle
that we call Developer Mode.

00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:12.266 A:middle
What Developer Mode does is that

00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:14.746 A:middle
it allows you to act as a

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:18.656 A:middle
teacher, so that you can create

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.216 A:middle
handout assignments, assign them

00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:22.146 A:middle
to students, and view progress

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
reports for your students, and

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:25.966 A:middle
it also allows you to act as a

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:27.126 A:middle
student, so you can consume

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:29.226 A:middle
those handouts and your app can

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:30.396 A:middle
report progress back to

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:30.796 A:middle
teachers.

00:07:33.226 --> 00:07:34.786 A:middle
There's also a way to reset the

00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:36.756 A:middle
development data and I

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.066 A:middle
personally had to use this

00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:40.316 A:middle
button quite a bit, to be

00:07:40.316 --> 00:07:40.676 A:middle
honest.

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.726 A:middle
With that, let's take a look at

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:44.786 A:middle
the classes we have in our

00:07:44.786 --> 00:07:45.236 A:middle
framework.

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:48.206 A:middle
At the very top, we have a Data

00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:48.526 A:middle
Store.

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:52.286 A:middle
It is used to maintain the

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:54.946 A:middle
Context Tree, within our app.

00:07:57.356 --> 00:07:59.236 A:middle
This is also where the main app

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.526 A:middle
context is exposed as a
