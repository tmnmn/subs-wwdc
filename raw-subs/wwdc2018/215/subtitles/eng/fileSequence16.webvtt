00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.066 A:middle
Abstract Class, and in our

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.366 A:middle
system, we have defined at the

00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:04.626 A:middle
moment, three subclasses.

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:07.396 A:middle
One of them is CLS Quantity

00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:07.776 A:middle
Item.

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.606 A:middle
This is useful for simple scalar

00:16:09.606 --> 00:16:10.886 A:middle
quantities like hints,

00:16:11.476 --> 00:16:13.056 A:middle
experience points, and things

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:13.876 A:middle
like that.

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:16.176 A:middle
We also have a score item which

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:18.046 A:middle
is useful to represent X out of

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:18.896 A:middle
Y quantities.

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:21.996 A:middle
For example, final score of a

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:23.946 A:middle
quiz might be useful for this.

00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:26.886 A:middle
And we also have a Binary Item.

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:30.696 A:middle
And this one is used to answer

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:32.456 A:middle
Yes or No questions, type of

00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:32.856 A:middle
questions.

00:16:33.366 --> 00:16:35.996 A:middle
Let's take a look at how would

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.666 A:middle
you add a primary activity item

00:16:37.776 --> 00:16:38.726 A:middle
to an activity.

00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:40.156 A:middle
Well, you will do that by first

00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:41.346 A:middle
creating an activity item.

00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:42.896 A:middle
In the [inaudible], we're

00:16:42.896 --> 00:16:44.546 A:middle
showing you how to create a

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.186 A:middle
Score Item with a title of Total

00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:46.576 A:middle
Score.

00:16:47.376 --> 00:16:49.286 A:middle
And then to associate it as a

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:50.676 A:middle
primary activity item

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.416 A:middle
[inaudible] activity, you will

00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:52.946 A:middle
set it -- you will set the

00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:54.806 A:middle
primary activity item property

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:55.566 A:middle
of an activity.

00:16:56.026 --> 00:16:59.856 A:middle
To add an additional activity

00:16:59.856 --> 00:17:01.176 A:middle
item, you will again create a
