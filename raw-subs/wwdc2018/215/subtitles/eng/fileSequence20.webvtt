00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:01.136 A:middle
makes sense for our sample app.

00:20:01.136 --> 00:20:03.286 A:middle
After we do that, we'll discuss

00:20:03.406 --> 00:20:05.396 A:middle
what type of student generated

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:07.276 A:middle
activity data, might also make

00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:07.596 A:middle
sense.

00:20:08.906 --> 00:20:10.206 A:middle
We'll make sure that we support

00:20:10.236 --> 00:20:10.966 A:middle
deep-linking.

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:12.726 A:middle
Now, there's two ways to do

00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:12.956 A:middle
this.

00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:15.106 A:middle
The first way is to use

00:20:15.106 --> 00:20:15.946 A:middle
universal links.

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:18.556 A:middle
So, if you already adopted

00:20:18.556 --> 00:20:19.996 A:middle
universal links within your

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:21.806 A:middle
applications, you can simply

00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:23.576 A:middle
just set the universal link

00:20:23.616 --> 00:20:25.326 A:middle
property that lives on CLS

00:20:25.496 --> 00:20:25.926 A:middle
Context.

00:20:27.556 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
Now, our sample app does not

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.486 A:middle
support universal links, so I'm

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:32.486 A:middle
going to show you the second

00:20:32.486 --> 00:20:34.476 A:middle
approach, which is to use NS

00:20:34.656 --> 00:20:36.186 A:middle
User Activities Continue

00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:37.146 A:middle
Restoration Handler.

00:20:38.586 --> 00:20:40.156 A:middle
Then we'll make sure that we

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.386 A:middle
test our implementation using

00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:44.426 A:middle
Developer Mode and the

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.206 A:middle
Schoolwork app.

00:20:46.546 --> 00:20:47.896 A:middle
So, now let's talk about what

00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:49.826 A:middle
type of context structure might

00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:51.836 A:middle
make sense for this app.

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.486 A:middle
As a first approach, we might

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:56.546 A:middle
decide to do a one-to-one map of

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.526 A:middle
RUI to a Context Tree.

00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:00.906 A:middle
And if we did that, we would end
