00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:02.586 A:middle
visit the Chapter 2 Context, but

00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:03.326 A:middle
it doesn't exist.

00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:04.846 A:middle
So, we are going to ask a

00:13:04.846 --> 00:13:05.906 A:middle
delegate to create it.

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.086 A:middle
If a delegate creates it, we

00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:09.556 A:middle
will then attach it to the

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:11.446 A:middle
correct place on the tree, and

00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:12.506 A:middle
we'll visit that context.

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.176 A:middle
Then we're going to build the

00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:17.206 A:middle
same thing for our Section 1.

00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:19.576 A:middle
Again, since section 1 is the

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:21.136 A:middle
last thing on the path, that

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:22.536 A:middle
means that this is what a path

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:25.936 A:middle
is referring to.

00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:28.256 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Activity

00:13:28.256 --> 00:13:28.706 A:middle
Objects.

00:13:29.486 --> 00:13:31.806 A:middle
So, Activity Objects are

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:32.886 A:middle
actually the objects which you

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:34.966 A:middle
will use to report progress back

00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:35.616 A:middle
to teachers.

00:13:36.276 --> 00:13:38.306 A:middle
And they actually translate to

00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:39.296 A:middle
Activity Reports.

00:13:39.726 --> 00:13:43.626 A:middle
Activity Objects are always

00:13:43.626 --> 00:13:46.116 A:middle
associated with contexts.

00:13:46.546 --> 00:13:48.156 A:middle
You can officially allocate one

00:13:48.156 --> 00:13:48.646 A:middle
on your own.

00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.966 A:middle
And the way you would create a

00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:54.256 A:middle
new one is by calling CLS

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:55.746 A:middle
Context Creating New Activity,

00:13:56.286 --> 00:13:57.776 A:middle
which will return a new activity

00:13:57.776 --> 00:13:59.506 A:middle
object associated with the

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.416 A:middle
receiver of the method.
