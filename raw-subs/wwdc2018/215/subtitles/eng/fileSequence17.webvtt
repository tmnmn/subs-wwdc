00:16:59.856 --> 00:17:01.176 A:middle
item, you will again create a

00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:02.126 A:middle
new Activity Item.

00:17:02.736 --> 00:17:03.816 A:middle
In the [inaudible] size, we're

00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:05.246 A:middle
showing how to create a quantity

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:07.766 A:middle
item with a type of hints, and

00:17:07.766 --> 00:17:09.195 A:middle
then some quantity.

00:17:09.766 --> 00:17:11.346 A:middle
To associate it with an

00:17:11.346 --> 00:17:13.806 A:middle
activity, you would call CLS

00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:15.506 A:middle
Activity Add Additional Activity

00:17:15.506 --> 00:17:18.465 A:middle
Item after passing the item you

00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:19.096 A:middle
just created.

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.465 A:middle
At that point, this activity

00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:22.435 A:middle
item will be associated with

00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:22.886 A:middle
activity.

00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:26.435 A:middle
So, there's some best practices

00:17:26.435 --> 00:17:27.746 A:middle
when dealing with activity

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:28.086 A:middle
items.

00:17:29.276 --> 00:17:32.056 A:middle
One of them is to always save

00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:33.676 A:middle
the subclass for a primary

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:34.326 A:middle
activity item.

00:17:35.636 --> 00:17:36.686 A:middle
What I mean by that is that

00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:38.956 A:middle
imagine a teacher assigns the

00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:40.566 A:middle
same context to two students.

00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:44.106 A:middle
You know, Student A device, you

00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:46.346 A:middle
set the primary activity item as

00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:46.926 A:middle
a score item.

00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:49.756 A:middle
On Student B device, you set the

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:51.586 A:middle
primary activity item as a

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:52.336 A:middle
binary item.

00:17:53.016 --> 00:17:54.266 A:middle
Well, if you do that, we can't

00:17:54.266 --> 00:17:56.126 A:middle
actually generate an aggregated

00:17:56.126 --> 00:17:58.096 A:middle
report back to teacher because

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.046 A:middle
there's no clear heuristic of
