&gt;&gt; Good morning, everybody.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.076 A:middle
My name is Pavel and Marin and I

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.186 A:middle
will be talking to you about

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:38.926 A:middle
ClassKit today.

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:42.626 A:middle
Our talk is split in three

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:42.996 A:middle
parts.

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:45.486 A:middle
In first part, we will give you

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:47.026 A:middle
a general overview of ClassKit.

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.356 A:middle
We will show you how data flows

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:50.116 A:middle
through the system.

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:52.196 A:middle
In the second part of the talk,

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:53.606 A:middle
we will list all the classes we

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.066 A:middle
have in our system and we'll

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.436 A:middle
mention a few interesting things

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:57.466 A:middle
about each one class.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.796 A:middle
And in the end, Marin is going

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.986 A:middle
to show us how to adopt ClassKit
