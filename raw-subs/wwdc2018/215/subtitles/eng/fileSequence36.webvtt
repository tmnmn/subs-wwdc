00:35:59.726 --> 00:36:00.736 A:middle
main part of the [inaudible].

00:36:01.026 --> 00:36:02.426 A:middle
Now, we've been able to validate

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.936 A:middle
that our activity item was set

00:36:03.936 --> 00:36:04.426 A:middle
correctly.

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:07.156 A:middle
I can also tap on the cell, and

00:36:07.156 --> 00:36:08.736 A:middle
I get a popover of all the

00:36:08.736 --> 00:36:10.076 A:middle
activity data I've written.

00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:12.616 A:middle
I can see the total score and in

00:36:12.616 --> 00:36:14.186 A:middle
light gray, I see the title of

00:36:14.236 --> 00:36:15.386 A:middle
Total Score that I set.

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:17.806 A:middle
And then at the bottom, we can

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.776 A:middle
see the time, and then each

00:36:19.776 --> 00:36:20.746 A:middle
individual question.

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.606 A:middle
And then also in light gray, we

00:36:22.606 --> 00:36:24.476 A:middle
can see the title that I set for

00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:25.746 A:middle
each one of those individuals

00:36:25.746 --> 00:36:26.216 A:middle
questions.

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:28.086 A:middle
So now, we've been able to

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:30.516 A:middle
validate that our activity data

00:36:30.896 --> 00:36:31.766 A:middle
was getting written.

00:36:32.646 --> 00:36:34.376 A:middle
So, with that, I would like to

00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:36.486 A:middle
reintroduce Pavel back on stage

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.826 A:middle
to go ahead and summarize

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:38.976 A:middle
everything that we've seen.

00:36:39.516 --> 00:36:47.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:49.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Marin.

00:36:50.446 --> 00:36:52.506 A:middle
So, I'd like to mention some

00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:53.966 A:middle
best practices about ClassKit.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.356 A:middle
For one, declare your contexts

00:36:57.446 --> 00:36:59.146 A:middle
as early as possibly so that

00:36:59.146 --> 00:37:00.456 A:middle
they're available to teachers to
