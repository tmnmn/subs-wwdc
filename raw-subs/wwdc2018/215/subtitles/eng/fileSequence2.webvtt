00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:00.606 A:middle
Teacher workflow, because they

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:01.946 A:middle
will be able to know exactly

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:02.916 A:middle
what's assignable within your

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
app and assign it to students.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.976 A:middle
It gives teachers insights

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.156 A:middle
within how students are doing in

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:12.216 A:middle
your app.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.706 A:middle
And this enables personalized

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:15.006 A:middle
learning.

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.386 A:middle
If a teacher knows how students

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:18.456 A:middle
are doing within your app

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:19.836 A:middle
exactly, they'll be able to

00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:22.566 A:middle
better cater future homework

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:23.026 A:middle
assignments.

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:25.736 A:middle
Lastly, well, it also gives you

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.006 A:middle
a competitive advantage.

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:28.686 A:middle
This is because with teachers

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:31.496 A:middle
while the type of information is

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.226 A:middle
surfaced back to them, chances

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:35.486 A:middle
are that they will be advocating

00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:37.436 A:middle
for your framework to -- for

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:39.456 A:middle
your app to be used within the

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:39.736 A:middle
school.

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:42.686 A:middle
Speaking of schools, there's a

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:44.806 A:middle
related technology called Apple

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:48.026 A:middle
School Manager, and school

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:51.416 A:middle
admins and IT use this to create

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:53.506 A:middle
managed Apple IDs for everybody

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:55.366 A:middle
within their organization.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.676 A:middle
So, every teacher will get a

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.456 A:middle
managed Apple ID and all

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.926 A:middle
students will get managed Apple
