00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:01.576 A:middle
our code that gets called when a

00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:03.366 A:middle
quiz first starts.

00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:06.616 A:middle
So, here, we said that we wanted

00:32:06.766 --> 00:32:11.526 A:middle
to start the timer for our quiz.

00:32:12.176 --> 00:32:14.816 A:middle
So, what we're going to do is

00:32:14.816 --> 00:32:16.186 A:middle
we're going to issue a query to

00:32:16.446 --> 00:32:18.566 A:middle
our CLS Data Source Shared

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:18.896 A:middle
Instance.

00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:21.176 A:middle
And then we're going to query in

00:32:21.286 --> 00:32:23.826 A:middle
our main app context for all of

00:32:23.826 --> 00:32:26.046 A:middle
the descendants, that match the

00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:28.116 A:middle
identifier path that's

00:32:28.116 --> 00:32:29.466 A:middle
associated with this quiz.

00:32:30.586 --> 00:32:32.166 A:middle
This will return an optional

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:32.656 A:middle
context.

00:32:33.786 --> 00:32:34.536 A:middle
We're going to grab that

00:32:34.616 --> 00:32:36.646 A:middle
context, make sure that we

00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:38.006 A:middle
called the Become Active, and

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:40.436 A:middle
then we're going to instantiate

00:32:40.436 --> 00:32:42.726 A:middle
a new instance of CLS activity.

00:32:43.176 --> 00:32:44.896 A:middle
And that's because when this

00:32:45.376 --> 00:32:47.716 A:middle
part of our code gets run, we

00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.066 A:middle
know that the student is taking

00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:50.306 A:middle
a new attempt at the quiz.

00:32:51.226 --> 00:32:52.686 A:middle
Then we're just going to cash

00:32:52.726 --> 00:32:54.326 A:middle
that activity and a property

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:55.866 A:middle
that we have defined.

00:32:56.676 --> 00:32:58.866 A:middle
Then, we call Start on Activity

00:32:59.056 --> 00:32:59.936 A:middle
to start our timer.
