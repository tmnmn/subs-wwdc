00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.366 A:middle
called when a student ends an

00:34:01.366 --> 00:34:01.676 A:middle
attempt.

00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:04.516 A:middle
Here, we're going to get that

00:34:04.636 --> 00:34:06.676 A:middle
same currently running activity.

00:34:07.446 --> 00:34:09.085 A:middle
Once we have that, we're going

00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:11.216 A:middle
to create a CLS score item,

00:34:11.846 --> 00:34:13.496 A:middle
passing a unique identifier,

00:34:14.216 --> 00:34:16.456 A:middle
title, and then we're going to

00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:18.315 A:middle
pass in the score the student

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.626 A:middle
received out of the total

00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:21.996 A:middle
maximum possible score.

00:34:23.056 --> 00:34:24.076 A:middle
Then, we're just going to add

00:34:24.076 --> 00:34:26.266 A:middle
that score item as the primary

00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:28.376 A:middle
activity item on our activity.

00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:30.426 A:middle
Notice, every time I'm doing

00:34:30.426 --> 00:34:31.826 A:middle
this, I'm always setting the

00:34:31.826 --> 00:34:34.806 A:middle
same subclass of CLS activity

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:35.176 A:middle
item.

00:34:35.525 --> 00:34:37.996 A:middle
It's always a score item.

00:34:39.206 --> 00:34:40.315 A:middle
Then, we're just going to call

00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:43.516 A:middle
Stop to stop our timer and save

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:44.886 A:middle
to save all of our changes.

00:34:45.936 --> 00:34:47.466 A:middle
So, now let's go ahead and run

00:34:47.466 --> 00:34:49.146 A:middle
this code to test that our

00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:51.106 A:middle
student generated activity data

00:34:51.366 --> 00:34:51.775 A:middle
gets set.

00:34:51.775 --> 00:34:54.326 A:middle
So, I switch back to my device,

00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:56.116 A:middle
and now we have to switch and

00:34:56.116 --> 00:34:57.816 A:middle
act as the role of a student.

00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.896 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead and go

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:01.556 A:middle
back to my Developer's Settings.
