00:09:59.876 --> 00:10:01.596 A:middle
inside of the safe area because

00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:02.556 A:middle
they represent additional

00:10:02.556 --> 00:10:04.076 A:middle
padding against the layout that

00:10:04.076 --> 00:10:04.616 A:middle
you want to do.

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:08.566 A:middle
But we thought to ourselves,

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:10.036 A:middle
"Hey, some people may not

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:10.856 A:middle
actually want this."

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:12.696 A:middle
And so we made it very easy for

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:13.746 A:middle
you to flip this default.

00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:15.616 A:middle
And so if you just change the

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:17.386 A:middle
insets layout margins from safe

00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:19.536 A:middle
area property from true to

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.056 A:middle
false, then we'll go ahead and

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:23.386 A:middle
move layout margins back to the

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:24.136 A:middle
bounds of the view.

00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:26.216 A:middle
As a [inaudible] instead of

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:27.656 A:middle
being encapsulated inside.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:29.366 A:middle
So what else can you do with

00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:29.926 A:middle
layout margins?

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:33.006 A:middle
Well, we already saw that by

00:10:33.006 --> 00:10:34.936 A:middle
default, safe area margins

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:36.276 A:middle
propagate down the hierarchy.

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:39.346 A:middle
But with layout margins, they go

00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:39.926 A:middle
by default.

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:41.626 A:middle
Because by default, your layout

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:42.716 A:middle
probably wants to be fairly

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:43.966 A:middle
independent with margins as

00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:45.136 A:middle
opposed to safe area, which

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:47.286 A:middle
represents a concept that really

00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
is for the entire view

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:48.616 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:51.416 A:middle
But if you want to have

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:52.786 A:middle
propagation, you can flip this

00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:55.136 A:middle
on view by view by changing

00:10:55.136 --> 00:10:56.336 A:middle
preserve super view layout

00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:59.086 A:middle
margins from false to true.

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:01.466 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and line up
