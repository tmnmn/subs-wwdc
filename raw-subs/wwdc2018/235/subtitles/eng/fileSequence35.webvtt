00:35:03.066 --> 00:35:05.336 A:middle
Now keeping with table views but

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:07.066 A:middle
moving on from readable width,

00:35:08.266 --> 00:35:11.006 A:middle
there is something else to know

00:35:11.006 --> 00:35:11.966 A:middle
how they work with safe area,

00:35:12.496 --> 00:35:14.826 A:middle
which is that the content views

00:35:14.886 --> 00:35:17.186 A:middle
of your table view cells will

00:35:17.186 --> 00:35:20.156 A:middle
not extend beyond the safe area.

00:35:21.656 --> 00:35:23.476 A:middle
However, by default, the

00:35:23.636 --> 00:35:25.066 A:middle
background and selected

00:35:25.066 --> 00:35:27.176 A:middle
background views do-- of UI

00:35:27.176 --> 00:35:29.206 A:middle
table view cell do extend beyond

00:35:29.206 --> 00:35:29.736 A:middle
the safe area.

00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:32.556 A:middle
So if you have some content you

00:35:32.556 --> 00:35:33.946 A:middle
want to place in custom table

00:35:33.946 --> 00:35:35.836 A:middle
view cells that you want to

00:35:35.836 --> 00:35:37.526 A:middle
overflow outside the safe area

00:35:37.526 --> 00:35:38.646 A:middle
and bleed to the edges of the

00:35:38.646 --> 00:35:40.666 A:middle
screen, you can either place it

00:35:40.706 --> 00:35:42.126 A:middle
in the background or selected

00:35:42.126 --> 00:35:43.196 A:middle
background views if the

00:35:43.196 --> 00:35:44.426 A:middle
semantics of those views make

00:35:44.466 --> 00:35:44.836 A:middle
sense.

00:35:45.446 --> 00:35:47.416 A:middle
Or there's a property on UI

00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:50.156 A:middle
table view called insets content

00:35:50.156 --> 00:35:52.706 A:middle
views to safe area, which by

00:35:52.706 --> 00:35:55.026 A:middle
default is true, but you can

00:35:55.026 --> 00:35:56.486 A:middle
change to false to get your

00:35:56.486 --> 00:35:58.206 A:middle
content views to also extend to

00:35:58.206 --> 00:35:58.576 A:middle
the edges.

00:35:59.136 --> 00:36:01.986 A:middle
And this property is also
