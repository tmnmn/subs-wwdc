00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:02.756 A:middle
control, flip this to false, and

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.386 A:middle
we'll use your margins as you

00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:06.106 A:middle
describe them, no questions

00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:07.006 A:middle
asked.

00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:09.566 A:middle
And so to wrap up with layout

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:12.616 A:middle
margins, the properties you have

00:12:12.616 --> 00:12:13.956 A:middle
on UI View are the layout

00:12:13.956 --> 00:12:15.906 A:middle
margins property, edge insets,

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.566 A:middle
left, right, top, bottom.

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:19.776 A:middle
Directional layout margins.

00:12:20.026 --> 00:12:21.646 A:middle
Great for your RTL layouts.

00:12:21.896 --> 00:12:23.006 A:middle
Top, bottom, leading, and

00:12:23.006 --> 00:12:23.456 A:middle
trailing.

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:26.366 A:middle
The Layout Margins Guide that

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:27.856 A:middle
you can use with Auto Layout to

00:12:27.856 --> 00:12:28.726 A:middle
do all this there.

00:12:28.726 --> 00:12:31.416 A:middle
And finally, if you have logic

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.586 A:middle
for when the layout margins

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:34.286 A:middle
change in your view, you can

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.716 A:middle
override layout margins did

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:37.596 A:middle
change and do whatever logic you

00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:38.176 A:middle
need to do there.

00:12:39.386 --> 00:12:41.076 A:middle
In Interface Builder to create a

00:12:41.076 --> 00:12:42.526 A:middle
constraint that ties against the

00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:44.166 A:middle
margin, just check that

00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:45.656 A:middle
constraints to margins box.

00:12:46.426 --> 00:12:48.086 A:middle
And so with that, I'll bring up

00:12:48.086 --> 00:12:49.666 A:middle
Tyler Fox to talk to you about

00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
scroll views.

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:57.336 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:57.836 --> 00:12:59.426 A:middle
