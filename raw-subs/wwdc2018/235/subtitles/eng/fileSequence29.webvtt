00:28:59.436 --> 00:29:02.876 A:middle
able to adapt to different, to

00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:04.626 A:middle
arbitrary safe area insets, that

00:29:04.926 --> 00:29:06.976 A:middle
will ensure that your views will

00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:08.866 A:middle
be able to, will be modular, can

00:29:08.866 --> 00:29:09.576 A:middle
be moved throughout your

00:29:09.576 --> 00:29:10.796 A:middle
application and run in

00:29:10.796 --> 00:29:12.266 A:middle
different, different

00:29:12.266 --> 00:29:13.376 A:middle
environments and still not be

00:29:13.376 --> 00:29:13.776 A:middle
occluded.

00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:18.796 A:middle
Now let's jump to an article and

00:29:18.886 --> 00:29:21.086 A:middle
talk about hiding the status

00:29:21.896 --> 00:29:21.996 A:middle
bar.

00:29:22.226 --> 00:29:23.736 A:middle
So hiding the status bar is a

00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.596 A:middle
technique that would reclaim 20

00:29:25.596 --> 00:29:27.446 A:middle
points of vertical screen real

00:29:27.446 --> 00:29:28.966 A:middle
estate on rectangular screen

00:29:28.966 --> 00:29:29.396 A:middle
phones.

00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:32.686 A:middle
And we're just doing this by

00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:34.806 A:middle
overriding preferred status bar

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:35.956 A:middle
hidden in our content view

00:29:35.956 --> 00:29:36.816 A:middle
controller and we're turning

00:29:36.816 --> 00:29:37.076 A:middle
true.

00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:38.486 A:middle
And this preference is then

00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:39.936 A:middle
propagating up through our

00:29:39.936 --> 00:29:40.906 A:middle
contained view controller

00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:43.576 A:middle
hierarchy and respected by the

00:29:43.576 --> 00:29:46.526 A:middle
root-- the root of the system.

00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:48.756 A:middle
Now unfortunately on iPhone 10,

00:29:49.296 --> 00:29:50.536 A:middle
preferring the status bar hidden

00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:52.196 A:middle
does not also hide the sensor

00:29:52.196 --> 00:29:52.476 A:middle
housing.

00:29:53.256 --> 00:29:55.186 A:middle
So we can't slide content

00:29:55.186 --> 00:29:56.676 A:middle
underneath it.

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.106 A:middle
[Laughs] So UIKit will protect

00:29:59.106 --> 00:30:00.816 A:middle
you and will not allow you to
