00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:00.446 A:middle
as you might expect.

00:23:00.866 --> 00:23:02.506 A:middle
Scroll view is going to always

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.846 A:middle
incorporate any system inset

00:23:04.846 --> 00:23:06.546 A:middle
like safe area insets into its

00:23:06.546 --> 00:23:08.596 A:middle
adjusted content inset on any

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:08.926 A:middle
edge.

00:23:09.236 --> 00:23:10.396 A:middle
And this works fine in our

00:23:10.396 --> 00:23:11.656 A:middle
particular example here.

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.026 A:middle
We only have a top and bottom

00:23:13.026 --> 00:23:14.336 A:middle
safe area inset on our scroll

00:23:14.336 --> 00:23:14.606 A:middle
view.

00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:16.816 A:middle
And so it will incorporate those

00:23:16.816 --> 00:23:17.966 A:middle
and the content gets to move out

00:23:17.966 --> 00:23:18.996 A:middle
from underneath the bars.

00:23:19.216 --> 00:23:20.306 A:middle
We don't have any horizontal

00:23:20.306 --> 00:23:21.596 A:middle
insets on the left or right.

00:23:21.956 --> 00:23:22.726 A:middle
So no problems.

00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:24.686 A:middle
But be careful with this one

00:23:24.686 --> 00:23:25.836 A:middle
because if you have something

00:23:25.836 --> 00:23:27.676 A:middle
like let's say a table view on

00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:29.196 A:middle
the iPhone 10 in landscape,

00:23:29.646 --> 00:23:30.746 A:middle
there are left and right safe

00:23:30.746 --> 00:23:31.546 A:middle
area insets.

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:33.626 A:middle
Using this behavior the table

00:23:33.626 --> 00:23:34.786 A:middle
view is going to incorporate

00:23:34.786 --> 00:23:36.186 A:middle
those into its adjusted content

00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:37.616 A:middle
inset, which increases the

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.146 A:middle
scrollable area, which is going

00:23:39.146 --> 00:23:39.836 A:middle
to make a table view

00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:40.846 A:middle
horizontally scrollable.

00:23:40.846 --> 00:23:42.206 A:middle
You're not going to want that

00:23:42.206 --> 00:23:42.536 A:middle
behavior.

00:23:43.876 --> 00:23:45.106 A:middle
That's why we have the next

00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:46.466 A:middle
behavior which is scrollable

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:46.736 A:middle
axes.

00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:49.536 A:middle
For this one, the scroll view is

00:23:49.536 --> 00:23:50.796 A:middle
going to independently consider

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:52.426 A:middle
things on the vertical axis and

00:23:52.426 --> 00:23:53.506 A:middle
the horizontal axis.

00:23:53.926 --> 00:23:55.516 A:middle
For each of those, if the

00:23:55.516 --> 00:23:57.606 A:middle
content size exceeds the width

00:23:57.606 --> 00:23:59.716 A:middle
or the height as appropriate, or
