00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:01.196 A:middle
property called content inset.

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:04.936 A:middle
So content inset is a mechanism

00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:06.316 A:middle
for you to provide insets that

00:16:06.316 --> 00:16:08.236 A:middle
you can specify from the edges

00:16:08.236 --> 00:16:09.456 A:middle
of the scrollable area of the

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.066 A:middle
scroll view to the content

00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:11.486 A:middle
inside.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:13.866 A:middle
So adding content inset

00:16:13.946 --> 00:16:15.696 A:middle
increases the scrollable area

00:16:15.696 --> 00:16:17.466 A:middle
and makes the scroll view able

00:16:17.466 --> 00:16:18.976 A:middle
to scroll to a larger area.

00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:20.966 A:middle
So let's set a content inset on

00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:22.706 A:middle
the top edge here and see what

00:16:22.706 --> 00:16:23.016 A:middle
happens.

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.546 A:middle
So here we've set a content

00:16:25.546 --> 00:16:26.326 A:middle
inset of 20.

00:16:27.126 --> 00:16:28.816 A:middle
And as you can see, that extends

00:16:28.816 --> 00:16:30.336 A:middle
that top edge of the scroll view

00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:31.476 A:middle
so that the scrollable area is

00:16:31.476 --> 00:16:32.076 A:middle
now larger.

00:16:33.176 --> 00:16:35.416 A:middle
Now when our content offset is

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:37.536 A:middle
sitting at zero, our content is

00:16:37.536 --> 00:16:38.636 A:middle
still aligned with the top of

00:16:38.636 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
the scroll view.

00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:40.876 A:middle
But the scroll view could

00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:42.196 A:middle
actually scroll even farther

00:16:42.596 --> 00:16:43.406 A:middle
towards the top now.

00:16:44.096 --> 00:16:45.786 A:middle
So let's scroll around like we

00:16:45.786 --> 00:16:47.196 A:middle
did before and watch how things

00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:47.906 A:middle
have changed.

00:16:48.866 --> 00:16:50.756 A:middle
We'll scroll to the bottom and

00:16:50.786 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
just like before, we're still

00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:54.056 A:middle
here at a content offset of 100.

00:16:54.936 --> 00:16:55.986 A:middle
That's because we didn't change

00:16:55.986 --> 00:16:57.296 A:middle
anything on the bottom edge.

00:16:57.536 --> 00:16:58.506 A:middle
And we still have a bottom

00:16:58.506 --> 00:16:59.886 A:middle
content inset of zero.
