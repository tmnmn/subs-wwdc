00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:00.426 A:middle
behind the scenes at what's

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:00.966 A:middle
going on.

00:15:02.296 --> 00:15:04.536 A:middle
So scroll views use content

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.446 A:middle
offset as a way to represent the

00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:07.626 A:middle
current scroll position of the

00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:08.086 A:middle
scroll view.

00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:10.286 A:middle
Right now, we're scrolled to the

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:10.776 A:middle
very top.

00:15:11.066 --> 00:15:12.626 A:middle
So our content offset is at

00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:14.496 A:middle
zero, meaning our top edge of

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:16.326 A:middle
the content is aligned with the

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:17.476 A:middle
top edge of the scroll view.

00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:20.366 A:middle
Now, if we go ahead and scroll

00:15:20.366 --> 00:15:21.676 A:middle
the scroll view down, that will

00:15:21.836 --> 00:15:23.146 A:middle
slide our content up.

00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:24.576 A:middle
So let's scroll to the bottom

00:15:24.576 --> 00:15:25.466 A:middle
and watch that happens here.

00:15:26.346 --> 00:15:27.616 A:middle
And as you can see, the content

00:15:27.616 --> 00:15:29.866 A:middle
offset increases and goes all

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.766 A:middle
the way to 100 in our example

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:32.676 A:middle
when we reach the bottom.

00:15:33.186 --> 00:15:34.376 A:middle
That's because the top edge of

00:15:34.376 --> 00:15:36.626 A:middle
the sc-- the scroll view is now

00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:38.446 A:middle
100 points below the top edge of

00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:39.296 A:middle
that content area.

00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:42.166 A:middle
If we set a content offset of

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.936 A:middle
zero on the scroll view, that

00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:45.166 A:middle
will put us all the way back up

00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:45.636 A:middle
to the top.

00:15:45.636 --> 00:15:47.256 A:middle
And we're back where we started.

00:15:48.146 --> 00:15:49.616 A:middle
So that's pretty much just the

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.966 A:middle
basics of scrolling a simple

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:51.776 A:middle
scroll view around.

00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:53.436 A:middle
Now let's talk about a very

00:15:53.436 --> 00:15:54.946 A:middle
important concept about

00:15:55.186 --> 00:15:57.666 A:middle
extending the scrollable area of

00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:58.216 A:middle
the scroll view.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.716 A:middle
And we do that through a

00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:01.196 A:middle
property called content inset.
