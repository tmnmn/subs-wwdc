00:25:59.486 --> 00:26:00.826 A:middle
layout margins are relative to

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:02.196 A:middle
the safe area, which means your

00:26:02.196 --> 00:26:03.116 A:middle
layout margins might end up

00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:04.486 A:middle
increasing or changing as a

00:26:04.486 --> 00:26:05.286 A:middle
result of this.

00:26:06.006 --> 00:26:07.576 A:middle
This is also going to disable

00:26:07.576 --> 00:26:08.886 A:middle
some very helpful automatic

00:26:08.936 --> 00:26:09.976 A:middle
behaviors that scroll view

00:26:09.976 --> 00:26:11.876 A:middle
provides like automatic scroll

00:26:11.876 --> 00:26:12.966 A:middle
indicator insets.

00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:16.046 A:middle
And so if you do a search online

00:26:16.046 --> 00:26:17.406 A:middle
and you see a favorite, you

00:26:17.406 --> 00:26:18.556 A:middle
know, question and answer

00:26:18.556 --> 00:26:19.766 A:middle
website suggesting that you set

00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:21.256 A:middle
your scroll view's content inset

00:26:21.256 --> 00:26:22.306 A:middle
adjustment behavior to never,

00:26:23.016 --> 00:26:24.766 A:middle
consider instead using

00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:26.546 A:middle
additional safe area insets to

00:26:26.596 --> 00:26:28.126 A:middle
increase the safe area insets.

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:29.206 A:middle
If your goal is to try to

00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:30.746 A:middle
express to the system that

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:31.966 A:middle
you've added let's say a toolbar

00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:33.436 A:middle
or some sort of other overlay.

00:26:33.976 --> 00:26:36.186 A:middle
Or you could consider just

00:26:36.226 --> 00:26:37.716 A:middle
modifying the content inset

00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:38.776 A:middle
directly, the property that we

00:26:38.776 --> 00:26:39.516 A:middle
talked about in the very

00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:39.956 A:middle
beginning.

00:26:39.996 --> 00:26:41.166 A:middle
That's for you to control.

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.446 A:middle
And you can use that to add or

00:26:42.446 --> 00:26:44.196 A:middle
subtract from the effective

00:26:44.296 --> 00:26:45.736 A:middle
adjusted content inset that the

00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:46.736 A:middle
scroll view will see.

00:26:47.116 --> 00:26:48.566 A:middle
So with that, I'd like to hand

00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:50.096 A:middle
it over to Russell to tell you

00:26:50.096 --> 00:26:51.646 A:middle
all about how to put this

00:26:51.646 --> 00:26:51.976 A:middle
altogether.

00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:57.516 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:58.016 --> 00:26:58.916 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tyler.
