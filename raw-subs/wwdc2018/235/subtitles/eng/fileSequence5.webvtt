00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:01.386 A:middle
another subview here.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:03.726 A:middle
And along with that, it will

00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:05.516 A:middle
have a view controller because a

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:06.456 A:middle
view controller is where we

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:07.526 A:middle
actually have the property that

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:09.006 A:middle
allows you to add additional

00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:09.606 A:middle
insets.

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:11.346 A:middle
And that property is called

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:14.616 A:middle
additional safe area insets.

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:16.336 A:middle
We're going to go ahead and

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:17.906 A:middle
inherit the insets we got from

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:18.316 A:middle
our parent.

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:21.116 A:middle
Add those additional safe area

00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:22.366 A:middle
insets to this view.

00:05:23.026 --> 00:05:24.616 A:middle
And finally construct the final

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.736 A:middle
safe area that let-- , layout

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:27.326 A:middle
guide.

00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.506 A:middle
What other things might you want

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.646 A:middle
to know about how safe area

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:31.816 A:middle
behaves in your application?

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:33.796 A:middle
Well, let's take a look at

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.576 A:middle
another example.

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.086 A:middle
Here we've got one view safely

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.366 A:middle
inside of the safe area of its

00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:38.776 A:middle
parent.

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:40.676 A:middle
So that view safe area, of

00:05:40.726 --> 00:05:42.276 A:middle
course, encapsulates the entire

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:43.066 A:middle
region of that view.

00:05:43.856 --> 00:05:45.186 A:middle
And we'll move it closer to one

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:46.766 A:middle
edge and as you might expect,

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:47.756 A:middle
we're not going to gain a safe

00:05:47.756 --> 00:05:49.406 A:middle
area because we haven't left the

00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:50.706 A:middle
safe area of our parent yet.

00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:53.196 A:middle
We'll move a little bit further

00:05:53.196 --> 00:05:55.236 A:middle
out, and you'll see that the

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:56.996 A:middle
bottom inset on that safe area

00:05:56.996 --> 00:05:57.966 A:middle
now grows a little bit.

00:05:58.236 --> 00:05:59.486 A:middle
It takes up a part where it

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:01.716 A:middle
overlaps, where it extends
