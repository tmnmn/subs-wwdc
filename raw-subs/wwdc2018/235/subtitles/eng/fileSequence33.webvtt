00:32:59.656 --> 00:33:01.846 A:middle
width is going to be wider than

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:03.366 A:middle
the width of a device of an

00:33:03.456 --> 00:33:05.546 A:middle
iPhone in any orientation which

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:06.926 A:middle
means it won't come into play.

00:33:07.636 --> 00:33:09.326 A:middle
However, even iPhones, if the

00:33:09.326 --> 00:33:11.836 A:middle
user selects a smaller dynamic

00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:13.066 A:middle
type font size than the default,

00:33:13.386 --> 00:33:14.576 A:middle
it can come into play, so it's

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:15.856 A:middle
still nice for your application

00:33:15.906 --> 00:33:16.886 A:middle
to adopt.

00:33:18.636 --> 00:33:20.976 A:middle
Now let's jump back out to our

00:33:21.326 --> 00:33:22.926 A:middle
article list table view and see

00:33:22.926 --> 00:33:23.966 A:middle
how readable width can work

00:33:24.056 --> 00:33:24.256 A:middle
here.

00:33:24.376 --> 00:33:26.286 A:middle
Now the thing to know about

00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:28.316 A:middle
table views is that they use

00:33:28.316 --> 00:33:30.566 A:middle
their layout margins, I'm

00:33:30.566 --> 00:33:32.386 A:middle
talking about the margins, to

00:33:32.386 --> 00:33:34.386 A:middle
layout a lot of their UI

00:33:34.386 --> 00:33:34.936 A:middle
elements.

00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:38.006 A:middle
So that means the separators,

00:33:38.326 --> 00:33:40.966 A:middle
the system accessories as well

00:33:40.966 --> 00:33:42.916 A:middle
as the labels in the system cell

00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:43.386 A:middle
styles.

00:33:43.976 --> 00:33:45.846 A:middle
And any views you lay out inside

00:33:45.846 --> 00:33:47.376 A:middle
of your own custom table view

00:33:47.376 --> 00:33:48.266 A:middle
cells, if you laid them out

00:33:48.266 --> 00:33:49.416 A:middle
against the margins, will play

00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:50.016 A:middle
along as well.

00:33:50.126 --> 00:33:52.756 A:middle
So that means if you adjust the

00:33:52.756 --> 00:33:55.496 A:middle
margins of a table view, you can

00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:57.346 A:middle
move all of these elements

00:33:57.416 --> 00:33:57.746 A:middle
together.

00:33:58.816 --> 00:34:00.106 A:middle
So if you have a table view with
