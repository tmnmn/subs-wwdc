00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:01.556 A:middle
to automatically set the content

00:18:01.556 --> 00:18:02.856 A:middle
inset on your scroll view

00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:05.426 A:middle
whenever it had overlapping bars

00:18:05.426 --> 00:18:07.276 A:middle
coming from a navigation bar or

00:18:07.276 --> 00:18:07.896 A:middle
a tool bar.

00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:09.476 A:middle
And that was whenever your

00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:10.726 A:middle
scroll view was inside of a view

00:18:10.726 --> 00:18:11.246 A:middle
controller.

00:18:11.606 --> 00:18:12.846 A:middle
Which itself was contained

00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:13.816 A:middle
inside of a navigation

00:18:13.816 --> 00:18:14.136 A:middle
controller.

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.656 A:middle
Now this worked pretty well for

00:18:16.656 --> 00:18:17.646 A:middle
some common cases.

00:18:18.026 --> 00:18:19.566 A:middle
But if your app had a more

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:21.876 A:middle
custom or advanced usage of UI

00:18:21.876 --> 00:18:24.196 A:middle
scroll view, sometimes having

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.016 A:middle
your code setting content inset

00:18:26.016 --> 00:18:28.156 A:middle
and also UIKit setting that same

00:18:28.156 --> 00:18:29.846 A:middle
content inset property could

00:18:29.846 --> 00:18:30.626 A:middle
create some challenges.

00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:33.726 A:middle
And so starting in iOS 11, we

00:18:33.956 --> 00:18:35.526 A:middle
have a much more explicit and

00:18:35.526 --> 00:18:37.346 A:middle
powerful way for you to get the

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.946 A:middle
same automatic behavior.

00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:41.336 A:middle
And the mechanism for doing this

00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:42.976 A:middle
is a new property on UI scroll

00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:44.786 A:middle
view which we'll talk about now

00:18:44.886 --> 00:18:46.586 A:middle
called adjusted content inset.

00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:50.356 A:middle
So starting in iOS 11, we

00:18:50.356 --> 00:18:51.546 A:middle
introduced a new property on UI

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:52.036 A:middle
scroll view.

00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:52.766 A:middle
It's read only.

00:18:52.806 --> 00:18:54.066 A:middle
It's adjust content inset.

00:18:54.406 --> 00:18:56.506 A:middle
And this basically describes how

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:57.776 A:middle
the scroll view is actually

00:18:57.776 --> 00:18:58.606 A:middle
going to behave.

00:18:59.716 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
Well you're probably asking
