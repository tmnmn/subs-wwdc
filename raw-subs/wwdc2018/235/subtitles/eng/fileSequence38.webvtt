00:37:59.946 --> 00:38:02.626 A:middle
So the first constraint we need

00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:04.586 A:middle
represents the padding that we

00:38:04.586 --> 00:38:05.996 A:middle
would other-- we would normally

00:38:06.226 --> 00:38:06.316 A:middle
add.

00:38:06.886 --> 00:38:07.956 A:middle
So this is just a constant

00:38:07.956 --> 00:38:09.066 A:middle
constraint from the bottom of

00:38:09.066 --> 00:38:11.236 A:middle
the super view to the bottom of

00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:11.756 A:middle
our control.

00:38:12.366 --> 00:38:13.386 A:middle
But in this case, we're going to

00:38:13.386 --> 00:38:15.126 A:middle
make it not required so that we

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.906 A:middle
can break it when the safe, when

00:38:16.906 --> 00:38:17.776 A:middle
the safe area insets are

00:38:17.776 --> 00:38:18.336 A:middle
non-zero.

00:38:19.936 --> 00:38:21.806 A:middle
The second constraint is an

00:38:21.806 --> 00:38:23.666 A:middle
inequality constraint from the

00:38:23.666 --> 00:38:25.406 A:middle
bottom of our control to the

00:38:25.406 --> 00:38:26.346 A:middle
bottom of the safe area.

00:38:27.186 --> 00:38:29.886 A:middle
This ensures that our control is

00:38:29.886 --> 00:38:31.326 A:middle
always inside the safe area.

00:38:32.006 --> 00:38:34.546 A:middle
So if I change the safe area

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:36.036 A:middle
insets to make them non-zero,

00:38:36.666 --> 00:38:38.496 A:middle
you can see that the inequality

00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:40.656 A:middle
constraint ensures our content

00:38:40.656 --> 00:38:42.946 A:middle
is not clipped while still

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:43.786 A:middle
maintaining some minimum

00:38:43.786 --> 00:38:44.000 A:middle
padding.

00:38:48.096 --> 00:38:50.956 A:middle
Now we've talked about many

00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:53.186 A:middle
different adaptive APIs in this

00:38:53.266 --> 00:38:54.806 A:middle
talk and in previous talks.

00:38:55.226 --> 00:38:56.996 A:middle
Layout margins help keep lots of

00:38:56.996 --> 00:38:57.996 A:middle
your elements aligned.

00:38:58.886 --> 00:39:00.466 A:middle
Safe area insets protect your
