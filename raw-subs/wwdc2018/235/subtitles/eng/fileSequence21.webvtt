00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
And we'll put this right in the

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:01.836 A:middle
content area.

00:21:01.836 --> 00:21:03.426 A:middle
And so right now this-- this

00:21:03.426 --> 00:21:05.296 A:middle
subview is sitting fully inside

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:06.566 A:middle
of the safe area in the scroll

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:06.756 A:middle
view.

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.446 A:middle
But what if we start to scroll

00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:11.036 A:middle
the scroll view down which will

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.026 A:middle
move that content up?

00:21:12.736 --> 00:21:14.936 A:middle
Just like this so that part of

00:21:14.936 --> 00:21:16.206 A:middle
that subview is now sitting

00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:18.206 A:middle
outside of the scroll view safe

00:21:18.206 --> 00:21:18.476 A:middle
area?

00:21:19.636 --> 00:21:21.106 A:middle
Based on the safe area inset

00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:22.546 A:middle
propagation that David just

00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:24.106 A:middle
talked to you about, you might

00:21:24.106 --> 00:21:25.456 A:middle
be thinking, okay, that means

00:21:25.456 --> 00:21:26.576 A:middle
the subview is going to start

00:21:26.616 --> 00:21:28.726 A:middle
seeing its own top edge safe

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:29.356 A:middle
area inset.

00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:31.276 A:middle
That's actually not what

00:21:31.276 --> 00:21:31.676 A:middle
happens.

00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.386 A:middle
The reason why is because when a

00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:36.746 A:middle
scroll view absorbs safe area

00:21:36.746 --> 00:21:38.966 A:middle
insets into its adjusted content

00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:40.966 A:middle
inset, it will no longer

00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:43.316 A:middle
propagate those same insets down

00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:44.646 A:middle
to its subviews on that same

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:45.016 A:middle
edge.

00:21:46.336 --> 00:21:47.236 A:middle
This is really important.

00:21:48.276 --> 00:21:50.316 A:middle
Scroll views use scrolling to

00:21:50.316 --> 00:21:52.306 A:middle
move content around and move it

00:21:52.306 --> 00:21:53.496 A:middle
out into the safe area.

00:21:54.516 --> 00:21:56.636 A:middle
And if a scroll view were to

00:21:56.986 --> 00:21:59.046 A:middle
also propagate safe area insets

00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:00.366 A:middle
that it was using to extend its
