00:35:59.136 --> 00:36:01.986 A:middle
And this property is also

00:36:02.246 --> 00:36:03.426 A:middle
configurable from Interface

00:36:04.056 --> 00:36:04.216 A:middle
Builder.

00:36:06.486 --> 00:36:07.826 A:middle
Now let's rotate back to

00:36:07.826 --> 00:36:08.246 A:middle
portrait.

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:09.836 A:middle
And in the main screen of our

00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:11.566 A:middle
application, we mentioned this

00:36:11.566 --> 00:36:12.676 A:middle
sheet that slides up from the

00:36:12.676 --> 00:36:13.986 A:middle
bottom before containing a

00:36:13.986 --> 00:36:14.476 A:middle
picker view.

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:19.536 A:middle
Now the safe area of the screen

00:36:19.536 --> 00:36:23.026 A:middle
here means that we have to

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:25.066 A:middle
adjust the layout of the picker

00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:28.706 A:middle
view to be inside this safe

00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:28.946 A:middle
area.

00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:33.426 A:middle
And most of the system controls,

00:36:33.486 --> 00:36:34.966 A:middle
like UI picker view and other

00:36:34.966 --> 00:36:36.016 A:middle
controls, and probably controls

00:36:36.016 --> 00:36:37.426 A:middle
of your own many views don't

00:36:37.426 --> 00:36:39.976 A:middle
make sense to have to know

00:36:39.976 --> 00:36:40.986 A:middle
anything about the safe area.

00:36:40.986 --> 00:36:42.586 A:middle
Because it's not clear how they

00:36:42.586 --> 00:36:44.446 A:middle
would respond or like re-lay out

00:36:44.446 --> 00:36:45.446 A:middle
themselves internally.

00:36:46.496 --> 00:36:47.556 A:middle
So we have a recommended

00:36:47.606 --> 00:36:49.126 A:middle
technique for handling the

00:36:49.126 --> 00:36:50.216 A:middle
layout of these kinds of views,

00:36:50.636 --> 00:36:53.146 A:middle
which is to place them inside of

00:36:53.146 --> 00:36:53.766 A:middle
the container view.

00:36:53.766 --> 00:36:56.016 A:middle
And the responsibility of this

00:36:56.046 --> 00:36:57.966 A:middle
container view is simply to

00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:00.466 A:middle
position its safe area unaware
