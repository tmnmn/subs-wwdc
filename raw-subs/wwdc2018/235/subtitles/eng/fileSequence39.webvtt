Safe area insets protect your

00:39:00.466 --> 00:39:02.056 A:middle
views from being clipped or

00:39:02.096 --> 00:39:02.466 A:middle
occluded.

00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:04.966 A:middle
Readable width keeps columns of

00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:05.876 A:middle
text comfortable to--

00:39:06.096 --> 00:39:07.046 A:middle
comfortable to read.

00:39:07.756 --> 00:39:10.056 A:middle
Size classes inform when you

00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:11.416 A:middle
should make large structur--

00:39:11.696 --> 00:39:12.746 A:middle
structural changes to your

00:39:12.746 --> 00:39:13.426 A:middle
applications.

00:39:15.226 --> 00:39:18.846 A:middle
And these APIs we use to

00:39:18.846 --> 00:39:20.126 A:middle
implement higher-level

00:39:20.126 --> 00:39:21.696 A:middle
components in our frameworks.

00:39:22.286 --> 00:39:24.496 A:middle
So scroll views, tab view--

00:39:24.706 --> 00:39:26.236 A:middle
table views, container view

00:39:26.236 --> 00:39:26.856 A:middle
controllers.

00:39:27.196 --> 00:39:27.956 A:middle
The other kinds of things we

00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:29.286 A:middle
talked about today reuse these

00:39:29.286 --> 00:39:31.756 A:middle
things to ensure that our

00:39:31.756 --> 00:39:33.576 A:middle
high-level components can adapt

00:39:34.056 --> 00:39:35.816 A:middle
to all of our devices in the

00:39:35.816 --> 00:39:36.866 A:middle
simplest way possible.

00:39:37.776 --> 00:39:40.006 A:middle
So the takeaway is for you to

00:39:40.006 --> 00:39:42.266 A:middle
design your applications in

00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:43.696 A:middle
terms of these adaptive

00:39:43.806 --> 00:39:44.816 A:middle
primitives as well.

00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:47.576 A:middle
The advantage is that-- instead

00:39:47.576 --> 00:39:49.926 A:middle
of coding for a specific device.

00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:52.196 A:middle
Your code will be simple,

00:39:52.566 --> 00:39:54.286 A:middle
flexible, and it'll guarantee

00:39:54.286 --> 00:39:55.486 A:middle
that your applications are as

00:39:55.616 --> 00:39:57.776 A:middle
future-proof as possible for all

00:39:57.776 --> 00:39:59.436 A:middle
of our different environments.
