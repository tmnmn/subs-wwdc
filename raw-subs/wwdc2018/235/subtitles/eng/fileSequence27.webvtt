00:27:00.516 --> 00:27:02.326 A:middle
Now we've introduced many

00:27:02.326 --> 00:27:03.536 A:middle
adaptive APIs to help your apps

00:27:03.616 --> 00:27:05.416 A:middle
over the years adapt to

00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.156 A:middle
different environments.

00:27:06.656 --> 00:27:08.216 A:middle
And safe area is really just the

00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:09.006 A:middle
newest of these.

00:27:09.006 --> 00:27:10.656 A:middle
So I'm going to review some of

00:27:10.656 --> 00:27:12.196 A:middle
these concepts and also talk

00:27:12.196 --> 00:27:13.576 A:middle
about how they work with safe

00:27:13.576 --> 00:27:13.836 A:middle
area.

00:27:15.456 --> 00:27:16.866 A:middle
So let's go to the first screen

00:27:16.866 --> 00:27:17.676 A:middle
of our application.

00:27:18.406 --> 00:27:20.276 A:middle
And we've got a pretty standard

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:21.546 A:middle
setup here with a tab bar

00:27:21.546 --> 00:27:22.596 A:middle
controller, continuing

00:27:22.596 --> 00:27:23.596 A:middle
navigation controller,

00:27:23.906 --> 00:27:25.756 A:middle
containing our content view

00:27:25.786 --> 00:27:26.166 A:middle
controller.

00:27:27.516 --> 00:27:29.226 A:middle
Now note that the views of all

00:27:29.286 --> 00:27:30.406 A:middle
three of these view controllers

00:27:30.656 --> 00:27:31.466 A:middle
are full screen.

00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:33.836 A:middle
This is what enables the tab bar

00:27:33.836 --> 00:27:35.236 A:middle
to extend underneath the home

00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:37.146 A:middle
indicator, the navigation bar to

00:27:37.146 --> 00:27:38.126 A:middle
extend underneath the status

00:27:38.126 --> 00:27:40.246 A:middle
bar, and the content to extend

00:27:40.246 --> 00:27:42.426 A:middle
and scroll underneath all of it.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:44.516 A:middle
But we need to prevent these

00:27:44.516 --> 00:27:45.626 A:middle
elements from overlapping.

00:27:45.806 --> 00:27:47.146 A:middle
So let's see how safe area

00:27:47.206 --> 00:27:49.316 A:middle
allows these components to do

00:27:50.016 --> 00:27:50.196 A:middle
that.

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:51.866 A:middle
So the safe area insets start by

00:27:51.866 --> 00:27:52.856 A:middle
flowing through the tab bar

00:27:52.856 --> 00:27:54.836 A:middle
controller, which only receives

00:27:54.836 --> 00:27:57.076 A:middle
insets on the home indicator and

00:27:57.076 --> 00:27:58.786 A:middle
status bar because that's all

00:27:58.786 --> 00:27:59.136 A:middle
that it sees.
