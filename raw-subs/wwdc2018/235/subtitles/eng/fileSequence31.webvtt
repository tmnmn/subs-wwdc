00:30:58.546 --> 00:31:00.106 A:middle
The problem with doing that, if

00:31:00.106 --> 00:31:01.146 A:middle
we had rendered the text all the

00:31:01.146 --> 00:31:03.446 A:middle
way to the edge, is that it can

00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:05.606 A:middle
become difficult to read, for

00:31:05.606 --> 00:31:07.246 A:middle
your eye to track from one line

00:31:07.246 --> 00:31:10.156 A:middle
of text to the next at a given

00:31:10.156 --> 00:31:10.576 A:middle
font size.

00:31:11.716 --> 00:31:14.396 A:middle
And so the solution is to always

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:16.806 A:middle
render text inside of a readable

00:31:16.806 --> 00:31:18.636 A:middle
width, a recommended readable

00:31:18.636 --> 00:31:20.036 A:middle
width provided by the system

00:31:20.476 --> 00:31:22.256 A:middle
based on the user's currently

00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:24.626 A:middle
selected dynamic type font size.

00:31:25.106 --> 00:31:26.676 A:middle
Dynamic type being another

00:31:26.876 --> 00:31:30.246 A:middle
adaptive element of our iOS.

00:31:30.986 --> 00:31:32.616 A:middle
Now you can get the readable

00:31:32.616 --> 00:31:35.676 A:middle
width with this API on UIView

00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:37.136 A:middle
called the readable content

00:31:37.136 --> 00:31:37.416 A:middle
guide.

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:39.176 A:middle
So this is another layout guide

00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:40.656 A:middle
just like the layout guide for

00:31:40.656 --> 00:31:42.106 A:middle
margins and safe area.

00:31:42.976 --> 00:31:44.086 A:middle
And it works just the same.

00:31:44.646 --> 00:31:47.646 A:middle
And I mentioned that this

00:31:48.066 --> 00:31:49.536 A:middle
readable width depends on the

00:31:49.536 --> 00:31:50.756 A:middle
user's currently selected

00:31:50.756 --> 00:31:52.656 A:middle
dynamic type size, which means

00:31:52.656 --> 00:31:53.916 A:middle
if the user changes their

00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:55.486 A:middle
dynamic type size in Control

00:31:55.486 --> 00:31:57.666 A:middle
Center or the setting app, the

00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:58.976 A:middle
readable width will get smaller

00:31:58.976 --> 00:32:00.000 A:middle
or larger to compensate.
