00:18:59.716 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
Well you're probably asking

00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:01.666 A:middle
what's the difference between

00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:03.726 A:middle
this adjusted content inset and

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:04.796 A:middle
the content inset that we just

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:05.356 A:middle
talked about?

00:19:05.886 --> 00:19:06.456 A:middle
Great question.

00:19:07.236 --> 00:19:08.066 A:middle
Here's how it breaks down.

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:11.616 A:middle
Adjusted content inset is equal

00:19:11.616 --> 00:19:13.626 A:middle
to the content inset that your

00:19:13.626 --> 00:19:16.276 A:middle
app provides plus any automatic

00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:18.096 A:middle
insets coming from the system or

00:19:18.096 --> 00:19:18.506 A:middle
UIKit.

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:21.156 A:middle
And so because we now separate

00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:23.276 A:middle
these two, it's a lot easier to

00:19:23.276 --> 00:19:24.326 A:middle
reason about what's happening.

00:19:25.446 --> 00:19:26.526 A:middle
Of course you might be wondering

00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:28.106 A:middle
where and when would I get a

00:19:28.206 --> 00:19:29.696 A:middle
system inset on my scroll view.

00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:32.726 A:middle
Well, one most common case will

00:19:32.726 --> 00:19:34.426 A:middle
be safe area insets.

00:19:35.126 --> 00:19:36.326 A:middle
Let's look at how this works.

00:19:36.736 --> 00:19:37.946 A:middle
So we're back to our basic

00:19:37.946 --> 00:19:38.696 A:middle
diagram here.

00:19:38.696 --> 00:19:39.726 A:middle
But we're going to bring some

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:41.436 A:middle
safe area insets into the mix.

00:19:42.746 --> 00:19:44.466 A:middle
So if we go ahead and start out

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:45.856 A:middle
right now we have no safe area

00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:46.986 A:middle
insets on any edge.

00:19:47.016 --> 00:19:48.526 A:middle
But we'll go ahead and add some

00:19:48.526 --> 00:19:50.346 A:middle
safe area insets to the top edge

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:51.036 A:middle
of our scroll view.

00:19:51.976 --> 00:19:54.026 A:middle
And what you'll see is that by

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.806 A:middle
default, the scroll view is

00:19:55.806 --> 00:19:57.886 A:middle
automatically absorbing those

00:19:57.886 --> 00:20:00.046 A:middle
safe area insets on its top edge
