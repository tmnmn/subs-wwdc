00:13:59.846 --> 00:14:01.406 A:middle
on more or less a real device.

00:14:01.796 --> 00:14:02.686 A:middle
And on the right, we're going to

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:04.026 A:middle
look at kind of things behind

00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:04.486 A:middle
the scenes.

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:06.396 A:middle
Understanding what's happening

00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:07.106 A:middle
in a diagram.

00:14:08.086 --> 00:14:09.466 A:middle
So everything that we talk about

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:11.046 A:middle
today is going to apply in--

00:14:11.046 --> 00:14:12.456 A:middle
we're going to talk about the y

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:13.856 A:middle
axis of everything vertically.

00:14:13.856 --> 00:14:15.136 A:middle
But everything also applies

00:14:15.136 --> 00:14:16.446 A:middle
equally to the x axis.

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:18.726 A:middle
And we're also going to use some

00:14:18.726 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
simple values for illustration.

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:21.826 A:middle
So in this case we'll say that

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:23.146 A:middle
our scroll view has a height of

00:14:23.146 --> 00:14:25.596 A:middle
400 points.

00:14:25.756 --> 00:14:27.076 A:middle
Now inside of your scroll view,

00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:28.946 A:middle
you'll have some content.

00:14:29.926 --> 00:14:31.056 A:middle
And you can think of the scroll

00:14:31.056 --> 00:14:32.726 A:middle
view a lot like a metaphorical

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:33.306 A:middle
picture frame.

00:14:33.896 --> 00:14:35.686 A:middle
The scroll view size represents

00:14:35.836 --> 00:14:37.196 A:middle
kind of the fixed frame of the

00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:37.806 A:middle
picture frame.

00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:39.586 A:middle
And then inside of that, the

00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:40.886 A:middle
picture is your content.

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:41.876 A:middle
And the content can kind of

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:43.836 A:middle
slide around as if it's on ball

00:14:43.836 --> 00:14:44.266 A:middle
bearings.

00:14:45.126 --> 00:14:46.996 A:middle
Now in this case, our content is

00:14:46.996 --> 00:14:47.936 A:middle
vertically scrollable.

00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:50.196 A:middle
And that happens because our

00:14:50.196 --> 00:14:52.276 A:middle
content has a taller height via

00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:54.486 A:middle
the content size than the scroll

00:14:54.486 --> 00:14:54.966 A:middle
view's height.

00:14:56.126 --> 00:14:56.906 A:middle
And here I've turned off

00:14:57.006 --> 00:14:58.366 A:middle
clipping on this diagram on the

00:14:58.366 --> 00:14:59.506 A:middle
right so we can kind of peek

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:00.426 A:middle
behind the scenes at what's
