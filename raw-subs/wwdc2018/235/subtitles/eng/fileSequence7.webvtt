00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:02.516 A:middle
area would have stayed on screen

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:04.236 A:middle
during the entire transition,

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.156 A:middle
which would have meant that you

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:07.286 A:middle
would have not seen the

00:07:07.286 --> 00:07:08.406 A:middle
background come up with it.

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:10.936 A:middle
And so that's why the safe area

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:12.486 A:middle
never grows larger on any

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:14.136 A:middle
dimension than what its parent

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:14.506 A:middle
provides.

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:18.466 A:middle
So to summarize that safe area

00:07:18.466 --> 00:07:19.936 A:middle
part, let's took a look at how

00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:21.606 A:middle
you can interact with it.

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:23.646 A:middle
Again, we've already mentioned

00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:25.236 A:middle
the safe area insets property

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:26.726 A:middle
and the safe area layout guide

00:07:26.726 --> 00:07:27.146 A:middle
property.

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.986 A:middle
But if your view needs to react

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.936 A:middle
to when safe area insets change,

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:33.906 A:middle
then you can override the safe

00:07:33.906 --> 00:07:36.506 A:middle
area insets did change method.

00:07:37.316 --> 00:07:38.846 A:middle
Typical thing you might do is

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:39.966 A:middle
just call set needs layout.

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:40.866 A:middle
But if there's any additional

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:41.926 A:middle
logic you need to run, that's

00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:42.486 A:middle
okay too.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.116 A:middle
If your view controller needs to

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.716 A:middle
respond to its view safe area

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.716 A:middle
layout changing, then you can

00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:50.766 A:middle
override view safe area insets

00:07:50.766 --> 00:07:52.086 A:middle
did change on your view

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:52.616 A:middle
controller.

00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:55.126 A:middle
And finally, if you're doing

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:56.756 A:middle
your interface in IB, you can

00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:59.106 A:middle
use that safe area property

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
that's shown in the view list to
