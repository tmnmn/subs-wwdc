00:28:00.776 --> 00:28:01.906 A:middle
Since the navigation controller

00:28:01.906 --> 00:28:03.996 A:middle
is inside of that, it also

00:28:04.036 --> 00:28:05.256 A:middle
receives a safe area inside in

00:28:05.256 --> 00:28:06.966 A:middle
the bottom that accounts for the

00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:07.406 A:middle
tab bar.

00:28:08.456 --> 00:28:09.596 A:middle
And the content view controller

00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:11.166 A:middle
inside of both received safe

00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:12.286 A:middle
area insets that account for

00:28:12.286 --> 00:28:12.926 A:middle
both bars.

00:28:12.926 --> 00:28:15.726 A:middle
Now what does the story look

00:28:15.726 --> 00:28:16.466 A:middle
like in landscape?

00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:18.086 A:middle
Similar.

00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:19.426 A:middle
There are safe area insets in

00:28:19.426 --> 00:28:20.206 A:middle
the top and bottom.

00:28:20.696 --> 00:28:22.106 A:middle
But there are also insets on the

00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.676 A:middle
left and right that account for

00:28:25.286 --> 00:28:26.486 A:middle
the size of the screen.

00:28:26.486 --> 00:28:27.886 A:middle
And those are propagated all the

00:28:27.886 --> 00:28:29.546 A:middle
way down from the screen through

00:28:29.546 --> 00:28:30.576 A:middle
the view controller hierarchy.

00:28:32.226 --> 00:28:33.696 A:middle
Now I want to stop here and use

00:28:33.696 --> 00:28:35.566 A:middle
this example to make a point

00:28:35.686 --> 00:28:37.516 A:middle
about how you should think about

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:38.636 A:middle
using safe area when you

00:28:38.636 --> 00:28:39.856 A:middle
implement your own views.

00:28:40.806 --> 00:28:43.156 A:middle
So this custom view shouldn't

00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.516 A:middle
know that it's running on an

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:45.156 A:middle
iPhone 10.

00:28:45.586 --> 00:28:46.886 A:middle
It shouldn't even know that it's

00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:48.626 A:middle
contained inside of container

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:49.326 A:middle
view controllers.

00:28:50.286 --> 00:28:51.776 A:middle
This is the idea of

00:28:51.776 --> 00:28:52.726 A:middle
encapsulation.

00:28:53.236 --> 00:28:55.456 A:middle
If your views only read the safe

00:28:55.456 --> 00:28:57.036 A:middle
area insets that are provided to

00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:59.436 A:middle
them on all four sides, and are

00:28:59.436 --> 00:29:02.876 A:middle
able to adapt to different, to
