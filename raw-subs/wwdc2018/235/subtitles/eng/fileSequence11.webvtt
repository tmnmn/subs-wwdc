00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:01.466 A:middle
And we'll go ahead and line up

00:11:01.516 --> 00:11:03.196 A:middle
those margins that are smaller

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.356 A:middle
than the parents in order to

00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:06.556 A:middle
make sure that everything lines

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.336 A:middle
up naturally between a child and

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:08.986 A:middle
its parent view.

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
Now in years past, you've

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:15.026 A:middle
probably also tried to change

00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:16.456 A:middle
layout margins of your view

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:17.346 A:middle
controller views.

00:11:18.196 --> 00:11:19.926 A:middle
And if you look at what we do by

00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:20.506 A:middle
default.

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:23.366 A:middle
That this margin that you'll see

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.186 A:middle
against that view.

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.376 A:middle
Now we additionally added a

00:11:27.376 --> 00:11:29.976 A:middle
property last year called system

00:11:29.976 --> 00:11:32.276 A:middle
minimum layout margins and these

00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:33.986 A:middle
margins are the minimum margins

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.336 A:middle
that we've combined against any

00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:38.596 A:middle
margins you provide now to

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:39.676 A:middle
create the final margin.

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:41.296 A:middle
So if you wanted to add to the

00:11:41.296 --> 00:11:42.796 A:middle
top and bottom of this, you can

00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:44.516 A:middle
do that without disturbing the

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:45.776 A:middle
left and right margins that

00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:46.546 A:middle
UIKit provides.

00:11:47.536 --> 00:11:48.836 A:middle
But again, you might want a

00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:49.776 A:middle
little bit more control.

00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:51.606 A:middle
And so there's another property

00:11:52.786 --> 00:11:54.766 A:middle
called view respects system

00:11:54.766 --> 00:11:55.876 A:middle
minimum layout margins.

00:11:56.786 --> 00:11:58.776 A:middle
If you want your margins to be

00:11:58.776 --> 00:11:59.786 A:middle
completely underneath your

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:02.756 A:middle
control, flip this to false, and
