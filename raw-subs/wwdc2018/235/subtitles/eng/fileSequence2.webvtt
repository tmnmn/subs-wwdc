00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.286 A:middle
On iPhone 10, there's a little

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:02.856 A:middle
extra space that's taken up on

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:03.976 A:middle
the top and bottom by the

00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:07.226 A:middle
hardware that will be taken away

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:08.936 A:middle
from the safe area for your

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:09.545 A:middle
application.

00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:12.196 A:middle
And in landscape, you've got

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:13.216 A:middle
something kind of similar where

00:02:13.726 --> 00:02:14.866 A:middle
we've given you a symmetric

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.606 A:middle
layout with space on the bottom

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:18.326 A:middle
for the home indicator for you

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:19.986 A:middle
to lay your content in safely.

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:22.766 A:middle
But what other devices might

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.286 A:middle
have a safe area that's not the

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:24.986 A:middle
entire screen?

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.156 A:middle
Well, Apple TV actually might

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.996 A:middle
give you the situation because

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:33.866 A:middle
certain TVs will have a screen

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.436 A:middle
that actually extends past

00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:36.656 A:middle
what's visible to the user.

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:38.746 A:middle
And those will represent their

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:40.096 A:middle
information based on something

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.736 A:middle
called overscan compensation.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:43.506 A:middle
And that overscan will be

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.156 A:middle
represented as a safe area in

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:46.606 A:middle
any apps that you build for

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:47.156 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.246 A:middle
So now that we've seen a few

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.836 A:middle
examples of what the safe area

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:53.146 A:middle
looks like at the screen of a

00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:55.226 A:middle
device, how does that get to

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:56.076 A:middle
your views?

00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:58.286 A:middle
And how do you use that in your

00:02:58.286 --> 00:02:59.816 A:middle
own applications to build

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:00.866 A:middle
adaptive applications?
