00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:05.246 A:middle
Now let's switch to portrait and

00:32:05.246 --> 00:32:07.096 A:middle
bring in our sidebar with our

00:32:07.096 --> 00:32:09.746 A:middle
article list to make the context

00:32:09.746 --> 00:32:11.156 A:middle
for our article display much

00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:11.636 A:middle
narrower.

00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:14.106 A:middle
So here the maximum recommended

00:32:14.106 --> 00:32:16.136 A:middle
readable-- readable width is

00:32:16.136 --> 00:32:18.056 A:middle
much wider than the space we

00:32:18.056 --> 00:32:19.226 A:middle
have to display the article.

00:32:20.236 --> 00:32:21.676 A:middle
And the thing to note is that

00:32:21.676 --> 00:32:23.496 A:middle
the readable content guide will

00:32:23.626 --> 00:32:26.246 A:middle
still not report the maximum

00:32:26.246 --> 00:32:27.366 A:middle
readable width necessarily.

00:32:27.366 --> 00:32:28.456 A:middle
It'll be clamped to the layout

00:32:28.456 --> 00:32:29.976 A:middle
margins, which means you can be

00:32:30.086 --> 00:32:31.616 A:middle
confident in laying out your

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.366 A:middle
views against the readable

00:32:33.366 --> 00:32:34.046 A:middle
content guide.

00:32:34.046 --> 00:32:35.106 A:middle
And not worry that they're going

00:32:35.106 --> 00:32:36.616 A:middle
to spill outside your margins.

00:32:39.306 --> 00:32:41.206 A:middle
Now let's see how this works on

00:32:41.206 --> 00:32:42.776 A:middle
a context for a safe area

00:32:42.776 --> 00:32:43.116 A:middle
exists.

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:44.886 A:middle
The readable content guide

00:32:44.886 --> 00:32:46.576 A:middle
functions just like-- just like

00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:48.616 A:middle
layout margins where its insets

00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.606 A:middle
add to those provided by the

00:32:50.606 --> 00:32:52.116 A:middle
safe area insets.

00:32:53.256 --> 00:32:56.376 A:middle
Now normally at the regular--

00:32:56.376 --> 00:32:58.176 A:middle
the default dynamic type font

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.656 A:middle
size of the system, the readable

00:32:59.656 --> 00:33:01.846 A:middle
width is going to be wider than
