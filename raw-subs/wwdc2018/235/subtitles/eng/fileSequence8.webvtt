00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
that's shown in the view list to

00:08:02.376 --> 00:08:03.966 A:middle
build your constraints against

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:04.596 A:middle
the safe area.

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:07.956 A:middle
And so a safe area is explained.

00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:09.506 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:10.000 A:middle
layout margins.

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:17.356 A:middle
So layout margins are padding.

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:19.036 A:middle
They're a property that, in

00:08:19.036 --> 00:08:20.556 A:middle
general, you have full control

00:08:20.556 --> 00:08:24.056 A:middle
over and allows you to specify a

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:25.306 A:middle
space from the edges of the

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:25.536 A:middle
view.

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.116 A:middle
Just like with safe areas,

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:30.196 A:middle
they're represented by a UI edge

00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:31.686 A:middle
insets property, this time

00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:32.866 A:middle
called layout margins.

00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:36.596 A:middle
Now last year, we also added

00:08:37.256 --> 00:08:38.486 A:middle
directional layout margins.

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:40.866 A:middle
These differ from layout margins

00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:42.885 A:middle
in that layout margins use a UI

00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:45.496 A:middle
Edge Insets value while

00:08:45.496 --> 00:08:47.116 A:middle
directional layout margins uses

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:48.626 A:middle
an NS directional edge insets.

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.376 A:middle
And the primary difference

00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:52.016 A:middle
between those two structures is

00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:53.576 A:middle
that directional insets use

00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:54.986 A:middle
leading and trailing instead of

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:56.846 A:middle
left and right, which makes it

00:08:56.846 --> 00:08:58.316 A:middle
really easy for you to create

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:01.316 A:middle
layout margins that adapt to RTL
