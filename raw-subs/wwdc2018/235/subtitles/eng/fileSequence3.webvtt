00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:00.866 A:middle
adaptive applications?

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.296 A:middle
So let's just pick up an

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:06.106 A:middle
arbitrary view.

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:07.316 A:middle
Whole thing.

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.876 A:middle
There are four insets on the

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:11.926 A:middle
top, bottom, and left and right

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:15.236 A:middle
that represent areas that might

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.456 A:middle
have some kind of overlay or

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:18.936 A:middle
other thing that might occlude

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:20.456 A:middle
your content if you placed it

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:20.626 A:middle
there.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.466 A:middle
You can access this on your UI

00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:25.966 A:middle
views using the safe area insets

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:26.426 A:middle
property.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:28.966 A:middle
A UI edge inset that has those

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:29.696 A:middle
four values.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:32.286 A:middle
Now if you're doing layout with

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:33.726 A:middle
Auto Layout, you actually might

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.906 A:middle
want to just see the entire rec

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:36.686 A:middle
that's safe.

00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:39.336 A:middle
And you can get that by looking

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.236 A:middle
at the safe area layout guide.

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.966 A:middle
Which is a UI layout guide that

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:45.916 A:middle
represents that information.

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:47.286 A:middle
It has layout anchors for you to

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:48.166 A:middle
do Auto Layout with.

00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:49.606 A:middle
And a layout frame if you just

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:50.416 A:middle
want to see the actual

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:50.876 A:middle
rectangle.

00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:54.966 A:middle
So now that we've seen how

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:56.166 A:middle
that's represented on our view,

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:58.676 A:middle
let's take a look at how it gets

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:00.846 A:middle
from one view to the next.
