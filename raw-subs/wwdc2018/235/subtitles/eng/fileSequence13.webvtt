00:13:00.186 --> 00:13:00.826 A:middle
Good afternoon.

00:13:01.506 --> 00:13:03.606 A:middle
And as David mentioned I'd like

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:04.526 A:middle
to talk a little bit about

00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:05.306 A:middle
scroll views today.

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:07.606 A:middle
So scroll views are a really key

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:09.156 A:middle
part of the iOS experience.

00:13:09.536 --> 00:13:10.856 A:middle
And they show up all across the

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:11.296 A:middle
system.

00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:12.646 A:middle
You have them in table views,

00:13:12.686 --> 00:13:14.896 A:middle
collection views, UI text view,

00:13:14.896 --> 00:13:16.006 A:middle
and of course in all of the

00:13:16.006 --> 00:13:17.546 A:middle
custom application in all of

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:18.156 A:middle
your apps.

00:13:19.026 --> 00:13:20.796 A:middle
And so in our app, Bagel Times

00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:21.876 A:middle
that we've been working really

00:13:21.876 --> 00:13:25.246 A:middle
hard on as you can tell, this is

00:13:25.246 --> 00:13:26.336 A:middle
our news article screen.

00:13:26.376 --> 00:13:28.076 A:middle
And everything as you can see is

00:13:28.076 --> 00:13:29.636 A:middle
sort of centered around a scroll

00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:30.486 A:middle
view with the article.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:31.486 A:middle
And this is we want to you know

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.196 A:middle
really showcase the high-quality

00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:34.456 A:middle
content our writers are putting

00:13:34.456 --> 00:13:34.846 A:middle
together.

00:13:34.846 --> 00:13:36.606 A:middle
Like, you know, exploring the

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:38.356 A:middle
true inspiration for, you know,

00:13:38.356 --> 00:13:38.946 A:middle
Apple Park.

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:41.536 A:middle
And we want to review some of

00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:43.296 A:middle
the basics about how you can use

00:13:43.296 --> 00:13:45.126 A:middle
scroll views in your apps to

00:13:45.126 --> 00:13:46.996 A:middle
understand how they can help you

00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:49.206 A:middle
adapt your content to devices of

00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:50.506 A:middle
different shapes and sizes.

00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:53.486 A:middle
So to do that, we're going to

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:54.806 A:middle
walk through an example here,

00:13:54.996 --> 00:13:56.116 A:middle
and we'll start with a

00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:57.156 A:middle
full-screen scroll view.

00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:58.636 A:middle
And on the left I'm going to

00:13:58.636 --> 00:13:59.846 A:middle
show you what things look like

00:13:59.846 --> 00:14:01.406 A:middle
on more or less a real device.
