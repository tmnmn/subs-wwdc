00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:01.716 A:middle
overlaps, where it extends

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.146 A:middle
outside of the safe area of its

00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
parent.

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:05.366 A:middle
And as we move closer to the

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:07.036 A:middle
edge there, it continues to

00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:07.446 A:middle
extend.

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:09.556 A:middle
Now what might you expect to

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:10.816 A:middle
happen if we move this view

00:06:10.816 --> 00:06:12.186 A:middle
further off the bottom edge of

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:12.676 A:middle
its parent?

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:16.506 A:middle
Well, how about that?

00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:18.246 A:middle
The safe area did not grow any

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:19.796 A:middle
further as the view moved

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.776 A:middle
outside of its parent.

00:06:21.676 --> 00:06:23.426 A:middle
No matter how far outside of the

00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:24.986 A:middle
parent that view might go.

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:26.506 A:middle
And you might be asking

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:28.066 A:middle
yourself, "Why would that, why

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:28.746 A:middle
would we do that?

00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:29.946 A:middle
What's the purpose here?"

00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:32.526 A:middle
And the answer is animation.

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:34.546 A:middle
In this particular case, we're

00:06:34.546 --> 00:06:35.836 A:middle
moving this subview out of its

00:06:35.886 --> 00:06:36.306 A:middle
parent.

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:38.156 A:middle
We wouldn't want the content to

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:39.516 A:middle
stay inside of the safe area

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:40.746 A:middle
because then it wouldn't move

00:06:40.846 --> 00:06:41.706 A:middle
with its own parent.

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:44.036 A:middle
And as an example, we can see

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:44.496 A:middle
this app.

00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:47.286 A:middle
Where we're going to pull up a

00:06:47.286 --> 00:06:48.256 A:middle
view on the bottom.

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:50.986 A:middle
If that view had been laid out

00:06:50.986 --> 00:06:51.956 A:middle
against the safe area of the

00:06:51.956 --> 00:06:54.046 A:middle
parent, or its parent, and that

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.156 A:middle
parent's safe area would extend

00:06:56.386 --> 00:06:57.366 A:middle
the farther it grew off the

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:59.576 A:middle
bottom of the screen, then this

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:02.516 A:middle
area would have stayed on screen
