00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:00.466 A:middle
position its safe area unaware

00:37:00.466 --> 00:37:03.796 A:middle
content inside the safe area by

00:37:04.416 --> 00:37:05.986 A:middle
analyzing the safe area insets.

00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:08.596 A:middle
And it can also provide the

00:37:08.596 --> 00:37:11.966 A:middle
background, which extends beyond

00:37:11.966 --> 00:37:13.036 A:middle
the safe area and makes your

00:37:13.036 --> 00:37:14.396 A:middle
control feel connected to the

00:37:14.726 --> 00:37:16.506 A:middle
edge of the screen in this case.

00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:19.736 A:middle
The-- another technique we want

00:37:19.736 --> 00:37:20.816 A:middle
to talk about related to safe

00:37:20.816 --> 00:37:22.096 A:middle
area and positioning elements

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:23.296 A:middle
close to the edge of the screen

00:37:23.796 --> 00:37:25.656 A:middle
is when you have a control or

00:37:25.656 --> 00:37:29.876 A:middle
button that on one device you

00:37:29.876 --> 00:37:31.356 A:middle
may want to place directly

00:37:31.356 --> 00:37:33.106 A:middle
against the safe area and on

00:37:33.106 --> 00:37:34.746 A:middle
another device where the safe

00:37:34.746 --> 00:37:36.376 A:middle
area insets are zero you may

00:37:36.376 --> 00:37:37.056 A:middle
want some padding.

00:37:37.616 --> 00:37:38.806 A:middle
And the reason for doing this in

00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:40.426 A:middle
design is that the safe area

00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:42.326 A:middle
insets can sometimes incorporate

00:37:42.396 --> 00:37:43.456 A:middle
some implicit padding.

00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:45.556 A:middle
So let me bring-- I want to

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.756 A:middle
provide you a single solution

00:37:47.986 --> 00:37:49.706 A:middle
that will work for both of these

00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:50.436 A:middle
situations.

00:37:51.246 --> 00:37:54.036 A:middle
So let's bring in a diagram, and

00:37:54.036 --> 00:37:55.286 A:middle
I'm going to give you two auto

00:37:55.286 --> 00:37:56.836 A:middle
layout constraints that will

00:37:56.836 --> 00:37:58.246 A:middle
produce this result in these two

00:37:58.246 --> 00:37:59.146 A:middle
different situations.

00:37:59.946 --> 00:38:02.626 A:middle
So the first constraint we need
