00:40:58.296 --> 00:41:00.166 A:middle
at some start time and we know

00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:01.796 A:middle
the cause of the fire and we

00:41:01.796 --> 00:41:03.536 A:middle
have a table that's bound to our

00:41:03.536 --> 00:41:05.876 A:middle
append side, that's the output

00:41:05.876 --> 00:41:08.876 A:middle
side of the modeler, and that

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:11.336 A:middle
table happens to be the schema

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.926 A:middle
that we define called started a

00:41:12.926 --> 00:41:16.776 A:middle
fire, then we can create a row

00:41:16.776 --> 00:41:18.126 A:middle
in that table and then set the

00:41:18.246 --> 00:41:19.946 A:middle
time and who started the fire to

00:41:19.946 --> 00:41:21.276 A:middle
the values that we captured up

00:41:21.276 --> 00:41:23.826 A:middle
here in the pattern.

00:41:23.906 --> 00:41:25.826 A:middle
Now with that, we basically

00:41:25.826 --> 00:41:27.756 A:middle
created our very first expert

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:29.356 A:middle
system to look for bad patterns

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:30.776 A:middle
in our application with these

00:41:30.776 --> 00:41:31.406 A:middle
two rules.

00:41:32.436 --> 00:41:34.376 A:middle
Now you may have noticed that

00:41:34.376 --> 00:41:36.016 A:middle
the rules were prepended by

00:41:36.016 --> 00:41:38.396 A:middle
either modeler or recorder.

00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:39.546 A:middle
Those are what are called

00:41:39.546 --> 00:41:41.606 A:middle
modules in Clips and they allow

00:41:41.606 --> 00:41:43.916 A:middle
you to both group rules but also

00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:45.426 A:middle
control the execution order of

00:41:45.426 --> 00:41:45.956 A:middle
the rules.

00:41:46.526 --> 00:41:48.556 A:middle
So for example, if you kept all

00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:50.946 A:middle
of your output, all of the rules

00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:52.176 A:middle
that produced output the output

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.006 A:middle
tables in the recorder module,

00:41:55.116 --> 00:41:57.536 A:middle
then you can be sure that you

00:41:57.536 --> 00:41:59.896 A:middle
won't write an output while

00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:00.456 A:middle
you're in the middle of the
