00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:00.456 A:middle
you're in the middle of the

00:42:00.456 --> 00:42:01.916 A:middle
reasoning process in modeler

00:42:02.246 --> 00:42:03.566 A:middle
because all the rules in modeler

00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:05.246 A:middle
have to execute before any of

00:42:05.246 --> 00:42:06.966 A:middle
the rules in recorder can

00:42:06.966 --> 00:42:07.746 A:middle
actually execute.

00:42:08.686 --> 00:42:10.736 A:middle
Now I mentioned the term before

00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.296 A:middle
logical support.

00:42:12.776 --> 00:42:14.556 A:middle
What logical support is usually

00:42:14.776 --> 00:42:17.066 A:middle
tied to what are called peer

00:42:17.066 --> 00:42:18.586 A:middle
inference rules and those are

00:42:18.586 --> 00:42:20.336 A:middle
rules that you say, well, if A

00:42:20.336 --> 00:42:21.736 A:middle
and B, then C.

00:42:22.156 --> 00:42:23.756 A:middle
Right. So by adding logical

00:42:23.756 --> 00:42:25.286 A:middle
support to your production, what

00:42:25.286 --> 00:42:29.646 A:middle
you're saying is if A and B are

00:42:29.646 --> 00:42:30.786 A:middle
no longer present in working

00:42:30.786 --> 00:42:32.126 A:middle
memory, then C should

00:42:32.126 --> 00:42:33.606 A:middle
automatically be retracted.

00:42:33.656 --> 00:42:35.726 A:middle
So what we're saying is C is

00:42:35.726 --> 00:42:37.016 A:middle
logically supported by the

00:42:37.016 --> 00:42:38.326 A:middle
existence of A and B.

00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:40.346 A:middle
Now this is important because it

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.606 A:middle
limits working memory bloat

00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:43.156 A:middle
which helps with resource

00:42:43.156 --> 00:42:44.436 A:middle
consumption but it's also

00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:46.096 A:middle
important to remove facts from

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.356 A:middle
working memory that are no

00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:48.076 A:middle
longer valid.

00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:49.486 A:middle
And if A and B are no longer

00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:50.966 A:middle
valid, then you should really

00:42:50.966 --> 00:42:51.526 A:middle
remove C.

00:42:52.076 --> 00:42:54.596 A:middle
So to add logical support to

00:42:54.826 --> 00:42:57.606 A:middle
your production, your rule here,

00:42:57.906 --> 00:42:59.826 A:middle
you just wrap the pattern with

00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:01.226 A:middle
the keyword logical and then
