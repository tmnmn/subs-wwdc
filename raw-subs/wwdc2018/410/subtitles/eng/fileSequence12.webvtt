00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
previously imported, tick.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:05.986 A:middle
Now we need to define what will

00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:08.126 A:middle
appear in [inaudible] view and

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:09.556 A:middle
detail view for our instrument.

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:11.966 A:middle
I will use graph element.

00:12:12.696 --> 00:12:15.886 A:middle
We need to fill out title for

00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:16.596 A:middle
our graph.

00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:19.166 A:middle
I will call it ticks.

00:12:19.486 --> 00:12:21.296 A:middle
And title for our lane.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:25.816 A:middle
I need to reference table by

00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:28.306 A:middle
identifier that was previously

00:12:28.306 --> 00:12:30.276 A:middle
created here, so I will

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:31.256 A:middle
reference tick table.

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:36.376 A:middle
And now we will specify plotting

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:37.186 A:middle
for our graph.

00:12:38.186 --> 00:12:39.646 A:middle
I will use plot element.

00:12:40.556 --> 00:12:42.926 A:middle
And in its most basic form, it

00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:44.226 A:middle
requires you only to pass

00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:45.446 A:middle
mnemonic of the column that

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:46.686 A:middle
contains value to be graphed.

00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:47.746 A:middle
We will be graphing time.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:48.876 A:middle
:11

00:12:52.696 --> 00:12:53.956 A:middle
I would like all of my

00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:56.776 A:middle
timestamps to be visible in a

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.156 A:middle
table.

00:12:57.826 --> 00:12:59.346 A:middle
To do this, I will use list

00:12:59.606 --> 00:12:59.976 A:middle
element.
