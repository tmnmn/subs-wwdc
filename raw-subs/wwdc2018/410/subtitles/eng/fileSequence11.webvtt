00:10:58.516 --> 00:11:00.636 A:middle
To make defining more complex

00:11:00.636 --> 00:11:02.736 A:middle
elements easier for you, we've

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.046 A:middle
deployed a number of snippets in

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:04.466 A:middle
Xcode.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:07.206 A:middle
To use them, just start writing

00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:09.146 A:middle
your element name, like

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:11.436 A:middle
instrument, and hit Return.

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:14.256 A:middle
You need to fill out your unique

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:15.976 A:middle
identifier for Instrument

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:22.946 A:middle
and a few properties that later

00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:23.976 A:middle
appear in Instruments Library.

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:31.216 A:middle
It will be Instrument drawing

00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:34.946 A:middle
ticks every 10 milliseconds.

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:41.186 A:middle
Now it's time to create a table

00:11:41.186 --> 00:11:42.696 A:middle
that will be instantiated when

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:44.416 A:middle
this instrument is dropped from

00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:46.456 A:middle
library to a trace document.

00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:49.346 A:middle
Table identifier has to be

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:50.936 A:middle
unique within this instrument

00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:51.536 A:middle
definition.

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:56.116 A:middle
Let's call it tick table.

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:57.786 A:middle
In schema-ref, we need to

00:11:57.786 --> 00:11:58.966 A:middle
reference schema that we

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
previously imported, tick.
