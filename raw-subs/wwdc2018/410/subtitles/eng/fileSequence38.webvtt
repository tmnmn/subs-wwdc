00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:03.076 A:middle
interval and then we grab the

00:38:03.076 --> 00:38:04.666 A:middle
next input, the modeler's clock

00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:06.036 A:middle
again moves to the beginning of

00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:07.226 A:middle
that interval and we enter that

00:38:07.226 --> 00:38:08.046 A:middle
into the working memory.

00:38:08.836 --> 00:38:10.376 A:middle
Now the modeler sees both of

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:12.656 A:middle
these in the working memory and

00:38:12.656 --> 00:38:14.366 A:middle
it can see that if playing with

00:38:14.366 --> 00:38:16.256 A:middle
matches started before the app

00:38:16.256 --> 00:38:17.336 A:middle
is on fire, it doesn't really

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.886 A:middle
make much difference, if it's

00:38:19.176 --> 00:38:19.956 A:middle
the other way around, it's

00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:22.406 A:middle
already on fire, then we can

00:38:22.406 --> 00:38:24.086 A:middle
draw a logical conclusion here

00:38:25.396 --> 00:38:27.936 A:middle
called the cause of fire and we

00:38:27.936 --> 00:38:29.526 A:middle
can enter that into the working

00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:29.846 A:middle
memory.

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.456 A:middle
Now as we grab this third input,

00:38:33.756 --> 00:38:34.986 A:middle
you'll notice that the modeler

00:38:34.986 --> 00:38:36.636 A:middle
clock has moved and it no longer

00:38:36.636 --> 00:38:38.396 A:middle
intersects with our first two

00:38:38.396 --> 00:38:38.996 A:middle
inputs.

00:38:39.516 --> 00:38:41.256 A:middle
And so those are removed from

00:38:41.256 --> 00:38:41.956 A:middle
the working memory.

00:38:42.766 --> 00:38:44.636 A:middle
Now if the cause of fire had

00:38:44.636 --> 00:38:45.886 A:middle
what's called logical support,

00:38:46.326 --> 00:38:48.236 A:middle
it would also be removed from

00:38:50.256 --> 00:38:50.556 A:middle
memory.

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:52.926 A:middle
Now to recap, the clock is

00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:54.336 A:middle
always set to the current input

00:38:54.386 --> 00:38:54.926 A:middle
timestamp.

00:38:55.556 --> 00:38:57.576 A:middle
And for an input to remain in

00:38:57.576 --> 00:38:58.936 A:middle
the working memory, it must

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.836 A:middle
intersect with the current clock
