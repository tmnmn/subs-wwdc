00:27:58.256 --> 00:28:00.996 A:middle
And size is set to the image

00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:01.786 A:middle
size.

00:28:02.236 --> 00:28:04.456 A:middle
Next let's take a look at our

00:28:04.456 --> 00:28:06.166 A:middle
prepare for use overwrite.

00:28:06.766 --> 00:28:09.546 A:middle
When there's running downloader

00:28:09.546 --> 00:28:11.116 A:middle
in progress, we cancel it.

00:28:12.126 --> 00:28:14.076 A:middle
We create signpost ID and call

00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:16.006 A:middle
our signpost end with the same

00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:18.016 A:middle
format string but now value is

00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:20.496 A:middle
canceled and size is zero

00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:21.896 A:middle
because download didn't succeed.

00:28:22.406 --> 00:28:25.446 A:middle
Let's take a look at our os

00:28:25.446 --> 00:28:26.786 A:middle
signpost interval schema

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:28.326 A:middle
definition and how we captured

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:30.386 A:middle
those signpost end package.

00:28:32.456 --> 00:28:34.456 A:middle
We define our signpost interval

00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:36.306 A:middle
schema with unique identifier

00:28:36.306 --> 00:28:36.936 A:middle
and title.

00:28:37.686 --> 00:28:40.306 A:middle
Then we define our subsystem and

00:28:40.306 --> 00:28:41.856 A:middle
category, which corresponds to

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:43.326 A:middle
the one that we passed when

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:44.596 A:middle
creating os log handle.

00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:49.346 A:middle
We create name element, which

00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:50.846 A:middle
corresponds to the one that we

00:28:50.846 --> 00:28:53.646 A:middle
passed in os signpost call and

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:56.156 A:middle
start pattern and end pattern.

00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:58.496 A:middle
These both correspond to the one

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.296 A:middle
that we passed in os signpost
