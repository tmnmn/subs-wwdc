00:51:59.436 --> 00:52:00.336 A:middle
is hard.

00:52:01.156 --> 00:52:03.256 A:middle
Immediate mode refers to the

00:52:03.256 --> 00:52:04.616 A:middle
recording mode of Instruments

00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:07.016 A:middle
where we're visualizing the data

00:52:07.016 --> 00:52:08.916 A:middle
as it's coming in, in near

00:52:08.916 --> 00:52:10.586 A:middle
real-time, and the reason it's

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:12.156 A:middle
hard, well there's really two

00:52:12.156 --> 00:52:12.766 A:middle
reasons it's hard.

00:52:12.856 --> 00:52:14.246 A:middle
The first one is it requires

00:52:14.246 --> 00:52:16.006 A:middle
some additional support that as

00:52:16.006 --> 00:52:17.176 A:middle
much as we wanted to cover

00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:18.436 A:middle
today, we just couldn't.

00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:19.546 A:middle
We just didn't have the time.

00:52:19.956 --> 00:52:20.726 A:middle
And so we're going to be working

00:52:20.726 --> 00:52:21.936 A:middle
on the documentation for that.

00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:24.156 A:middle
But the second reason, and this

00:52:24.156 --> 00:52:26.456 A:middle
is the more important reason, is

00:52:26.456 --> 00:52:28.606 A:middle
that, well it's interval data,

00:52:29.076 --> 00:52:29.296 A:middle
right.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:31.236 A:middle
So intervals can't be entered

00:52:31.236 --> 00:52:32.766 A:middle
into the tables in the Analysis

00:52:32.766 --> 00:52:34.406 A:middle
Core until they're closed,

00:52:34.406 --> 00:52:35.316 A:middle
meaning that we've seen both the

00:52:35.316 --> 00:52:36.346 A:middle
begin and the end.

00:52:36.496 --> 00:52:37.576 A:middle
And so when you're looking at a

00:52:37.576 --> 00:52:39.386 A:middle
recording live, you have a bunch

00:52:39.386 --> 00:52:40.176 A:middle
of what are called open

00:52:40.176 --> 00:52:40.696 A:middle
intervals.

00:52:40.886 --> 00:52:42.216 A:middle
Now if your modelers require

00:52:42.216 --> 00:52:43.506 A:middle
these as inputs, which is

00:52:43.586 --> 00:52:45.576 A:middle
totally feasible, then what

00:52:45.576 --> 00:52:46.956 A:middle
you'll notice is that if there's

00:52:46.956 --> 00:52:48.936 A:middle
an open interval upstream, well

00:52:48.936 --> 00:52:50.426 A:middle
all of the modeler clocks

00:52:50.426 --> 00:52:52.266 A:middle
downstream have to stop until

00:52:52.266 --> 00:52:53.716 A:middle
that interval is closed because

00:52:53.716 --> 00:52:55.186 A:middle
remember, the modeler's vision

00:52:55.186 --> 00:52:56.986 A:middle
is all in time order.

00:52:57.116 --> 00:52:58.796 A:middle
So it can't move that clock

00:52:58.796 --> 00:53:00.196 A:middle
forward until all those
