00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
instruments?

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:02.576 A:middle
Instruments already ships with a

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:03.896 A:middle
lot of really powerful tools,

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:05.616 A:middle
for example here we have System

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:06.776 A:middle
Trace where you can see how your

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.046 A:middle
application is interacting with

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:09.086 A:middle
the scheduler and the virtual

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:09.456 A:middle
memory.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.076 A:middle
We have a new game performance

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:13.396 A:middle
template this year that combines

00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:14.596 A:middle
System Trace and Metal System

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:17.496 A:middle
Trace to help you spot glitches

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:19.216 A:middle
and missed frames in your

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:19.776 A:middle
application.

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:23.276 A:middle
And if you're on the network

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:24.916 A:middle
portion of your application, we

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:26.226 A:middle
also have the Network

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:27.166 A:middle
Connections Instrument, which

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.916 A:middle
can show you TCP/IP traffic

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:30.476 A:middle
coming in and out of your app.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.126 A:middle
And then, of course, a lot of

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:33.696 A:middle
you are familiar with the Time

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:34.156 A:middle
Profiler.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:35.506 A:middle
Time Profiler is a great way to

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:37.316 A:middle
see where your application is

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:38.866 A:middle
spending its time, whether that

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.006 A:middle
be the networking layer or the

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:41.396 A:middle
game engine or some other

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:41.826 A:middle
portion.

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.756 A:middle
Now the common thing here is

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:48.896 A:middle
that these are all very useful

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:50.376 A:middle
if you know the code that you're

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.646 A:middle
profiling, right.

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:52.466 A:middle
So if you know those IP

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.416 A:middle
addresses, you know what those

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:54.856 A:middle
mean, and you know what the

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:56.306 A:middle
different functions mean and the

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:58.236 A:middle
call stack of the Time Profiler,

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.196 A:middle
it makes it a lot easier.

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.826 A:middle
But what if someone is profiling
