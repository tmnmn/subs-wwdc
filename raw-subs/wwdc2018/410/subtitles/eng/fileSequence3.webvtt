00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
bunch of performance tools at

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:00.946 A:middle
once.

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:02.966 A:middle
Now the major difference between

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.646 A:middle
then and now is that back then

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:05.516 A:middle
the infrastructure of

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:06.816 A:middle
Instruments didn't really do a

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.626 A:middle
lot to help us write instruments

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:08.976 A:middle
quickly.

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:11.606 A:middle
And at the time, that was okay

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:12.866 A:middle
because we had already inherited

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:14.526 A:middle
quite a few assets and

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:15.766 A:middle
performance tools that we

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:16.336 A:middle
already had.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.956 A:middle
They all had their own recording

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:18.726 A:middle
technology and their own

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.436 A:middle
analysis logic and all we had to

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:22.196 A:middle
do was build a custom storage

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.266 A:middle
mechanism to get the data in the

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.506 A:middle
trace and a custom UI to help

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:26.806 A:middle
integrate it with the rest of

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:27.786 A:middle
the app.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.816 A:middle
Now over time, the maintenance

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.126 A:middle
costs of Instruments and

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:32.736 A:middle
maintaining this model shot up.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:34.626 A:middle
And the reason for that was

00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:36.526 A:middle
every time we wanted to add a

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:37.876 A:middle
new feature we had to modify

00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:39.546 A:middle
seven custom UIs and seven

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:41.846 A:middle
custom storage mechanisms and

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:43.746 A:middle
that's not the model we wanted

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:44.676 A:middle
you guys to inherent.

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:45.626 A:middle
We didn't want you to inherit

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:46.756 A:middle
this kind of maintenance costs.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:48.516 A:middle
So before we even talked about

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:49.646 A:middle
doing a custom Instruments'

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.236 A:middle
feature, we needed to solve that

00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:52.776 A:middle
first and I think we did.

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:54.556 A:middle
So in the new version of

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.186 A:middle
Instruments, instead of having

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.516 A:middle
custom UIs and custom storage

00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:58.906 A:middle
mechanisms, we have two

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.456 A:middle
standardized components and
