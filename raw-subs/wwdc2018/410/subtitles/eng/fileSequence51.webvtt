00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:00.306 A:middle
really be thinking, you know,

00:51:00.306 --> 00:51:01.876 A:middle
can this be its own instrument.

00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:03.216 A:middle
And the reason for that is if

00:51:03.216 --> 00:51:05.366 A:middle
you create finer-grained

00:51:05.726 --> 00:51:07.326 A:middle
instruments, you give the users

00:51:07.326 --> 00:51:08.206 A:middle
of Instruments a lot more

00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:08.766 A:middle
choices.

00:51:09.256 --> 00:51:10.686 A:middle
They can drag just the

00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:11.716 A:middle
instruments that they want out

00:51:11.716 --> 00:51:13.156 A:middle
of the library and that will

00:51:13.156 --> 00:51:14.996 A:middle
minimize the recording impact on

00:51:14.996 --> 00:51:15.496 A:middle
the target.

00:51:15.876 --> 00:51:17.306 A:middle
If you focus on one instrument

00:51:17.306 --> 00:51:18.546 A:middle
with lots of features, it's kind

00:51:18.546 --> 00:51:19.416 A:middle
of like an all-or-nothing

00:51:19.416 --> 00:51:20.026 A:middle
proposal there.

00:51:20.986 --> 00:51:24.616 A:middle
Now, if you want to create a

00:51:24.616 --> 00:51:26.066 A:middle
combination of instruments that

00:51:26.636 --> 00:51:27.476 A:middle
are going to be targeted at a

00:51:27.476 --> 00:51:29.666 A:middle
certain problem, you want to see

00:51:29.666 --> 00:51:30.486 A:middle
all these instruments used

00:51:30.486 --> 00:51:31.366 A:middle
together at the same time,

00:51:31.366 --> 00:51:33.616 A:middle
rather, then what you can do is

00:51:33.616 --> 00:51:34.976 A:middle
create your own custom template

00:51:35.146 --> 00:51:36.156 A:middle
like we did for the networking.

00:51:36.696 --> 00:51:37.896 A:middle
And so what you do to get that

00:51:37.896 --> 00:51:39.486 A:middle
started on that is create a

00:51:39.486 --> 00:51:40.966 A:middle
document, drag the instruments

00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:42.126 A:middle
in the way that you want to see

00:51:42.126 --> 00:51:44.116 A:middle
them, configure them, go to File

00:51:44.116 --> 00:51:44.926 A:middle
and then say, "save as

00:51:44.926 --> 00:51:45.316 A:middle
template."

00:51:45.706 --> 00:51:46.696 A:middle
And then you can use that

00:51:46.696 --> 00:51:48.656 A:middle
template inside your package

00:51:48.836 --> 00:51:50.666 A:middle
using the element that Kacper

00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:52.016 A:middle
had added to our Networking

00:51:52.216 --> 00:51:52.496 A:middle
Template.

00:51:53.226 --> 00:51:54.606 A:middle
So writing with more than one

00:51:54.606 --> 00:51:55.836 A:middle
instrument is a lot better way

00:51:55.836 --> 00:51:56.486 A:middle
to use tool.

00:51:58.046 --> 00:51:59.436 A:middle
The second one is immediate mode

00:51:59.436 --> 00:52:00.336 A:middle
is hard.
