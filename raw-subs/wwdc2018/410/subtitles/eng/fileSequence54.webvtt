00:53:59.156 --> 00:54:00.646 A:middle
that the last five-second

00:54:00.646 --> 00:54:03.466 A:middle
recording mode is by far the

00:54:03.466 --> 00:54:04.066 A:middle
most efficient.

00:54:04.346 --> 00:54:05.816 A:middle
Now the way you switch that is

00:54:05.816 --> 00:54:07.256 A:middle
in the recording options of your

00:54:07.256 --> 00:54:08.886 A:middle
trace document, you'll see that

00:54:08.886 --> 00:54:09.776 A:middle
you have a choice between

00:54:09.776 --> 00:54:11.256 A:middle
immediate, deferred, and this

00:54:11.256 --> 00:54:12.676 A:middle
last end seconds mode.

00:54:13.246 --> 00:54:14.486 A:middle
That is going to be a lot more

00:54:14.486 --> 00:54:16.476 A:middle
efficient because what it allows

00:54:16.476 --> 00:54:18.016 A:middle
the recording technology to do

00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:19.666 A:middle
is use buffering to improve

00:54:19.716 --> 00:54:20.906 A:middle
performance so that it's not

00:54:20.906 --> 00:54:21.896 A:middle
trying to feed the data to

00:54:21.896 --> 00:54:22.976 A:middle
Instruments in real time.

00:54:23.376 --> 00:54:24.586 A:middle
Now this can have a profound

00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:26.876 A:middle
effect and it can have a huge

00:54:26.876 --> 00:54:28.286 A:middle
effect on signpost data where it

00:54:28.286 --> 00:54:29.856 A:middle
can be up to ten times faster

00:54:30.096 --> 00:54:31.756 A:middle
inside five-second mode.

00:54:32.246 --> 00:54:33.326 A:middle
Now of course the trade-off is

00:54:33.466 --> 00:54:34.796 A:middle
that you're only seeing the last

00:54:34.796 --> 00:54:37.136 A:middle
five seconds of data but for

00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:39.056 A:middle
instruments that produce high

00:54:39.056 --> 00:54:40.736 A:middle
volumes of data, that's usually

00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:41.276 A:middle
a good thing.

00:54:41.446 --> 00:54:43.016 A:middle
So this is the common mode for a

00:54:43.016 --> 00:54:45.346 A:middle
System Trace and a Metal System

00:54:45.346 --> 00:54:46.486 A:middle
Trace and Game Performance

00:54:46.536 --> 00:54:46.916 A:middle
template.

00:54:47.176 --> 00:54:48.566 A:middle
And if you're targeting one of

00:54:48.566 --> 00:54:50.066 A:middle
those kinds of applications, I

00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:51.546 A:middle
would also opt your instrument

00:54:51.546 --> 00:54:53.136 A:middle
out of supporting immediate mode

00:54:53.476 --> 00:54:54.506 A:middle
just so that your user

00:54:54.506 --> 00:54:56.096 A:middle
experience is not terrible or

00:54:56.096 --> 00:54:58.086 A:middle
Instruments gets way behind on

00:54:58.086 --> 00:54:59.236 A:middle
trying to get the data or you

00:54:59.236 --> 00:55:00.286 A:middle
run into that problem with the
