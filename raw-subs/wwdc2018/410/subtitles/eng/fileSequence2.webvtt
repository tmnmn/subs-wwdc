00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.826 A:middle
But what if someone is profiling

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:02.916 A:middle
your application and they're not

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.176 A:middle
familiar with their code, right?

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:05.746 A:middle
What if they just want to see is

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.216 A:middle
the application spending a lot

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:08.265 A:middle
of time in the networking layer,

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:10.086 A:middle
and, if so, what is it doing?

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.946 A:middle
Well, a good use for a custom

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
instrument would be to try to

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.886 A:middle
tell the story of what your

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.096 A:middle
layer or what your application

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.936 A:middle
is doing in a way that someone

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:21.216 A:middle
who doesn't understand the code

00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:22.916 A:middle
can understand and appreciate

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:22.983 A:middle
it.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:25.986 A:middle
Now in the advanced section,

00:02:25.986 --> 00:02:27.516 A:middle
we're going to show you how to

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:28.596 A:middle
take advantage of the Expert

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:30.296 A:middle
System Technology that built

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:31.846 A:middle
inside of Instruments so that

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:33.766 A:middle
you can create an instrument

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:35.366 A:middle
that's actually able to look for

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
bad patterns and spot

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.206 A:middle
anti-patterns in your code even

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:38.786 A:middle
if you're not there.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:41.256 A:middle
Alright, so let's take a look at

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:42.666 A:middle
the architecture that makes this

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:43.156 A:middle
possible.

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:45.226 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:47.996 A:middle
have to start here, back at the

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:48.406 A:middle
beginning.

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:51.276 A:middle
So in the beginning, Instruments

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:52.656 A:middle
works about the same as it does

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:52.866 A:middle
today.

00:02:52.936 --> 00:02:54.156 A:middle
There's still a library.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:55.546 A:middle
You still drag instruments out

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:56.816 A:middle
and drop them into your trace

00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.456 A:middle
document and then you press

00:02:58.456 --> 00:02:59.346 A:middle
Record and it's like running a

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
bunch of performance tools at
