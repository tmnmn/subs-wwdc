00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:01.546 A:middle
solution for what we call the

00:22:01.546 --> 00:22:02.216 A:middle
thread narrative.

00:22:03.706 --> 00:22:04.736 A:middle
Now the next part about the

00:22:04.736 --> 00:22:06.886 A:middle
binding solution is that it's

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:09.056 A:middle
trace-wide and so as you're

00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:09.916 A:middle
dragging and dropping

00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:11.196 A:middle
instruments into the trace,

00:22:11.386 --> 00:22:13.906 A:middle
Instruments is computing the

00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:15.956 A:middle
best possible recording solution

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:17.616 A:middle
to try to minimize the recording

00:22:17.616 --> 00:22:20.336 A:middle
impact on the target.

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:21.786 A:middle
Now when you create your own

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:23.256 A:middle
tables or when you create table

00:22:23.256 --> 00:22:24.196 A:middle
instances, you have to give them

00:22:24.196 --> 00:22:24.616 A:middle
a schema.

00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:26.706 A:middle
And Instruments already has over

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:28.786 A:middle
100 schemas defined.

00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:30.896 A:middle
And all of these schemas are

00:22:30.896 --> 00:22:31.956 A:middle
available to you and are

00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.016 A:middle
contained in the packages that

00:22:33.016 --> 00:22:33.896 A:middle
you saw in the Package

00:22:33.896 --> 00:22:34.506 A:middle
Management UI.

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:36.376 A:middle
You can just simply import the

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:38.466 A:middle
schema into your own package.

00:22:39.036 --> 00:22:41.216 A:middle
Now if that schema is contained

00:22:41.216 --> 00:22:42.516 A:middle
in a package that's not the base

00:22:42.516 --> 00:22:44.246 A:middle
package, you have to also link

00:22:44.246 --> 00:22:45.756 A:middle
that package as a build setting

00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:47.086 A:middle
in Xcode for Linked Instruments

00:22:47.086 --> 00:22:49.046 A:middle
Packages that you can set so

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.116 A:middle
that we can find that extra

00:22:50.116 --> 00:22:51.526 A:middle
package that you're referring to

00:22:51.526 --> 00:22:52.746 A:middle
at build time and do some type

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:53.096 A:middle
checking.

00:22:54.716 --> 00:22:56.276 A:middle
Now because all of these schemas

00:22:56.276 --> 00:22:57.586 A:middle
are defined in other packages

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.346 A:middle
when you hit Record, all the

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
tables with those schemas will
