00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:04.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chad.

00:26:09.836 --> 00:26:12.576 A:middle
So Trailblazer app is an iOS app

00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:14.676 A:middle
that displays lists of popular

00:26:14.796 --> 00:26:16.176 A:middle
hiking trails near you.

00:26:16.856 --> 00:26:19.686 A:middle
As an UI component, UI table

00:26:19.686 --> 00:26:19.976 A:middle
View.

00:26:21.006 --> 00:26:22.766 A:middle
Each cell loads image for a

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:24.156 A:middle
trail asynchronously.

00:26:25.276 --> 00:26:26.936 A:middle
To prevent glitches and as an

00:26:26.936 --> 00:26:28.876 A:middle
optimization when cell is

00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:30.376 A:middle
reused, we cancel the download.

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.276 A:middle
To visualize my flow of

00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:35.546 A:middle
downloads, I wrap every download

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:36.356 A:middle
in os signpost call.

00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:36.936 A:middle
Let's take a look at it.

00:26:41.536 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
When my [inaudible] cell is

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:44.796 A:middle
displayed, start Image download

00:26:44.796 --> 00:26:45.556 A:middle
method is called.

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:48.456 A:middle
We create downloader signpost

00:26:48.456 --> 00:26:50.946 A:middle
ID, which takes os log handle

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.466 A:middle
and downloader object.

00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:55.516 A:middle
We then grab address of UI table

00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:59.366 A:middle
View cell and call os signpost
