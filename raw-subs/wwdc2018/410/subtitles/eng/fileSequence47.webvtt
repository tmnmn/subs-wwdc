00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.296 A:middle
Then, you'll write modeler rule

00:47:03.296 --> 00:47:05.066 A:middle
that creates this fact in

00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:05.816 A:middle
working memory.

00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:11.286 A:middle
This rule looks at os signpost

00:47:11.326 --> 00:47:11.676 A:middle
table.

00:47:12.536 --> 00:47:15.336 A:middle
We specify subsystem, name, and

00:47:15.426 --> 00:47:18.006 A:middle
event type begin and we capture

00:47:18.006 --> 00:47:19.336 A:middle
all of the information that we

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.306 A:middle
want to have.

00:47:21.186 --> 00:47:22.926 A:middle
So we capture image name, caller

00:47:22.926 --> 00:47:25.026 A:middle
address, time, and signpost

00:47:25.026 --> 00:47:25.586 A:middle
identifier.

00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:28.306 A:middle
Then, we assert new fact to

00:47:28.436 --> 00:47:28.956 A:middle
working memory.

00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:36.676 A:middle
To clean it up after download

00:47:36.746 --> 00:47:39.406 A:middle
finishes, we need to retract

00:47:39.406 --> 00:47:40.666 A:middle
this fact from working memory.

00:47:44.426 --> 00:47:46.066 A:middle
Here, we are looking at the same

00:47:46.066 --> 00:47:48.606 A:middle
table but we are looking at only

00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:51.736 A:middle
event of type end.

00:47:52.866 --> 00:47:54.246 A:middle
We capture identifier of the

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:54.836 A:middle
signpost.

00:47:55.756 --> 00:47:57.426 A:middle
And here, we are using the fact

00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:00.096 A:middle
that signpost begin and end has
