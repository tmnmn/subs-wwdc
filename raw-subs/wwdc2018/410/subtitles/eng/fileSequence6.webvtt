00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
lanes, graphing three different

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:01.576 A:middle
types of CPU utilization.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.436 A:middle
And each one of these lanes is

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.906 A:middle
bound to a different table in

00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:07.426 A:middle
the Analysis Core or it can be

00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:08.796 A:middle
bound to the same table but

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:09.646 A:middle
you're looking at a different

00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:11.046 A:middle
column in the table.

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:14.566 A:middle
Now the other portion of the

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:16.556 A:middle
instrument is the lower portion,

00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:17.786 A:middle
which is equally as important.

00:06:17.786 --> 00:06:18.736 A:middle
It's called the Detail View.

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.216 A:middle
And that's where you can see the

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:22.536 A:middle
event-by-event lists and also

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.066 A:middle
any sort of aggregations and

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:26.086 A:middle
summaries of your data.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.306 A:middle
Now just like the lanes, oh, I'm

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:31.146 A:middle
sorry, just like the graphs, you

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:32.836 A:middle
can define a number of details

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:34.176 A:middle
for your instrument and you can

00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:35.536 A:middle
select which detail is active by

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:36.416 A:middle
clicking this portion of the

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:37.976 A:middle
jump bar and then selecting the

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:39.586 A:middle
title of detail that you define.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:42.616 A:middle
Now just like the lanes in the

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:44.786 A:middle
graph, all of the details are

00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:46.656 A:middle
bound to again a table in the

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.016 A:middle
Analysis Core and that's where

00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:48.786 A:middle
they receive the data.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:50.006 A:middle
The recording happens.

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:50.966 A:middle
The tables fill in.

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:52.626 A:middle
And UI reacts and there's no

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:53.976 A:middle
special code needed on your

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:55.366 A:middle
behalf.

00:06:56.156 --> 00:06:58.836 A:middle
Now from the perspective of the

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
Standard UI, everything in the
