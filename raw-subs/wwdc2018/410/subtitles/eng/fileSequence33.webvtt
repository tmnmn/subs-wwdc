00:33:00.716 --> 00:33:03.786 A:middle
You can see that track view was

00:33:03.786 --> 00:33:04.936 A:middle
propagated with data.

00:33:06.616 --> 00:33:08.746 A:middle
Each plot was created for each

00:33:08.746 --> 00:33:09.636 A:middle
image name.

00:33:11.366 --> 00:33:12.816 A:middle
You can see that label format

00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:14.366 A:middle
matches the one that we passed

00:33:14.366 --> 00:33:15.586 A:middle
in package definition.

00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:19.056 A:middle
And if download is higher rather

00:33:19.056 --> 00:33:21.176 A:middle
than 3 and 1/2 megabytes, our

00:33:21.176 --> 00:33:22.406 A:middle
plane is colored in red.

00:33:23.596 --> 00:33:25.266 A:middle
Size appears on the plane.

00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:28.576 A:middle
Next, we can take a look at all

00:33:28.576 --> 00:33:30.286 A:middle
of the details.

00:33:32.436 --> 00:33:35.146 A:middle
Firstly, we have list downloads.

00:33:36.066 --> 00:33:38.096 A:middle
This is just a list of all the

00:33:38.096 --> 00:33:38.976 A:middle
downloads that happened.

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:42.346 A:middle
We can choose our aggregation,

00:33:42.866 --> 00:33:46.746 A:middle
which divides all of the

00:33:46.746 --> 00:33:48.236 A:middle
downloads by image name.

00:33:48.616 --> 00:33:49.926 A:middle
You can see that it on top we

00:33:49.926 --> 00:33:51.856 A:middle
downloaded 12 images.

00:33:52.156 --> 00:33:55.886 A:middle
And image for location seven was

00:33:55.886 --> 00:33:59.436 A:middle
downloaded two times.

00:33:59.616 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
Next, we can take a look at
