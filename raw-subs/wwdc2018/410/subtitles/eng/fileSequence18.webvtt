00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:00.926 A:middle
contents of the data, you can

00:18:00.926 --> 00:18:01.866 A:middle
define what's called a plot

00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:02.326 A:middle
template.

00:18:02.996 --> 00:18:04.666 A:middle
Now a plot template is defined

00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.316 A:middle
very similarly to a plot except

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:07.406 A:middle
there's an extra element in

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:08.936 A:middle
there that allows you to choose

00:18:08.936 --> 00:18:10.536 A:middle
a column in the table and it

00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:12.276 A:middle
will create a separate row for

00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:13.566 A:middle
each unique value in that

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:13.956 A:middle
column.

00:18:16.016 --> 00:18:17.046 A:middle
Now if you're looking for just

00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:18.456 A:middle
spikes or periods of activity,

00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:19.126 A:middle
we have what's called a

00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:21.016 A:middle
histogram and what you can do is

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:22.846 A:middle
break the timeline over certain

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:24.066 A:middle
size buckets, let's say 100

00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:25.566 A:middle
milliseconds, and then use

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.176 A:middle
functions like count or sum or

00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:29.996 A:middle
min or max to sort of drive up

00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:31.186 A:middle
the magnitude of those buckets

00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:32.976 A:middle
as the different points or

00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:33.946 A:middle
intervals are intersecting.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.066 A:middle
So it's a great way to look for

00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:38.136 A:middle
spikes in activity such as here

00:18:38.136 --> 00:18:39.046 A:middle
in the System Trace where we're

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:40.216 A:middle
looking for spikes of activity

00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:41.746 A:middle
in context switches or virtual

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.086 A:middle
memory.

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:45.126 A:middle
Now let's talk about details.

00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:46.926 A:middle
Details are on the lower half of

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:47.396 A:middle
the UI.

00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:49.376 A:middle
And you've already seen the

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:50.626 A:middle
first one, which is the List.

00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:52.266 A:middle
That's very simple mapping

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:53.666 A:middle
between the Table and Analysis

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:56.896 A:middle
Core and a table view in the UI.

00:18:56.896 --> 00:19:00.066 A:middle
We also have aggregations.
