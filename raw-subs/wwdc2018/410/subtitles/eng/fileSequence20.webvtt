00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:00.246 A:middle
column that's a weight.

00:20:00.476 --> 00:20:01.316 A:middle
You can create weighted

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:02.556 A:middle
backtrace or a weighted Call

00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:04.546 A:middle
Tree view using the Call Tree

00:20:04.616 --> 00:20:05.976 A:middle
like you see in Time Profiler.

00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:09.406 A:middle
Now another style is called a

00:20:09.406 --> 00:20:09.896 A:middle
narrative.

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:12.426 A:middle
And the narrative is used when

00:20:12.426 --> 00:20:14.166 A:middle
you want to convey information

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:15.506 A:middle
that's just best left to

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.046 A:middle
technical language, such as the

00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:18.526 A:middle
output of an expert system and

00:20:18.526 --> 00:20:19.696 A:middle
that works hand-in-hand with the

00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:21.346 A:middle
narrative engineering type.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.776 A:middle
Now the last type of detail here

00:20:25.866 --> 00:20:26.956 A:middle
is called a time slice.

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.346 A:middle
The time slice looks very much

00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:30.176 A:middle
like a list except the contents

00:20:30.176 --> 00:20:31.866 A:middle
are filtered to include only the

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.506 A:middle
intervals that intersect with

00:20:33.506 --> 00:20:34.636 A:middle
that blue line you see on the

00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:35.086 A:middle
graph.

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:36.116 A:middle
That's called the inspection

00:20:36.116 --> 00:20:36.366 A:middle
head.

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:37.866 A:middle
So as you move the inspection

00:20:37.866 --> 00:20:39.436 A:middle
head over the graph, the

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:40.756 A:middle
contents of the list will be

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.586 A:middle
filtered to match what

00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:44.056 A:middle
intersects with that inspection

00:20:44.056 --> 00:20:44.226 A:middle
head.

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.156 A:middle
Now all of these UIs are bound

00:20:49.156 --> 00:20:50.896 A:middle
to tables in the Analysis Core.

00:20:51.306 --> 00:20:53.146 A:middle
And when you hit Record, the

00:20:53.146 --> 00:20:54.266 A:middle
data comes in through the

00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:55.586 A:middle
Instruments app and fills in the

00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:57.176 A:middle
data in the Analysis Core.

00:20:57.936 --> 00:20:59.396 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit more

00:20:59.396 --> 00:21:00.976 A:middle
about how that process works.
