00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.496 A:middle
out now so we can know what

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:03.026 A:middle
we're looking at.

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:04.336 A:middle
Okay, an example of the schema

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:05.596 A:middle
here is tick.

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:07.106 A:middle
This is one of schemas that

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.926 A:middle
comes inside of Instruments and

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.286 A:middle
it's used to hold a table of

00:08:10.286 --> 00:08:11.666 A:middle
synthetic clock ticks that we'll

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:13.676 A:middle
use later for statistical

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:15.146 A:middle
computations in our modelers.

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:17.076 A:middle
Now it is very simple.

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:18.456 A:middle
It has one column that's defined

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.956 A:middle
and that's time and it's using

00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:20.626 A:middle
the engineering type

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:21.356 A:middle
sample-time.

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:24.046 A:middle
And it also defines an optional

00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:25.606 A:middle
attribute that can be attached

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:26.796 A:middle
to that table instance called

00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:27.346 A:middle
frequency.

00:08:27.856 --> 00:08:30.066 A:middle
So if you create a table with a

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:32.096 A:middle
frequency equals 10 attribute

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:34.456 A:middle
here for our tick schema, then

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:36.576 A:middle
the provider of that data knows

00:08:36.576 --> 00:08:38.046 A:middle
that it needs to fill that table

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:40.326 A:middle
with ten timestamps per second,

00:08:40.616 --> 00:08:40.806 A:middle
right.

00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:41.826 A:middle
So that's a way to communicate

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:42.806 A:middle
what you want filled into the

00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:43.176 A:middle
table.

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:45.916 A:middle
Now with that, I think we have

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:47.766 A:middle
enough information to help us

00:08:47.766 --> 00:08:48.366 A:middle
get started.

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.076 A:middle
So we're going to show you how

00:08:50.076 --> 00:08:52.256 A:middle
to create your own Instruments

00:08:52.296 --> 00:08:54.046 A:middle
package project in Xcode and

00:08:54.046 --> 00:08:54.906 A:middle
we're going to show you how to

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:55.876 A:middle
create your very first

00:08:55.876 --> 00:08:57.316 A:middle
instrument that graphs these

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.196 A:middle
ticks and shows these ticks in

00:08:59.196 --> 00:08:59.886 A:middle
the detail view.
