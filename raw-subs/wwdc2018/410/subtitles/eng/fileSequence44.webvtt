00:43:59.796 --> 00:44:00.956 A:middle
anti-patterns in our app

00:44:00.956 --> 00:44:01.976 A:middle
networking behavior.

00:44:02.756 --> 00:44:03.656 A:middle
I was playing with my

00:44:03.656 --> 00:44:05.646 A:middle
Trailblazer app and it seemed

00:44:05.646 --> 00:44:07.086 A:middle
that if I'm scrolling pretty

00:44:07.136 --> 00:44:08.746 A:middle
fast, there are some glitches

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:09.476 A:middle
visible here.

00:44:09.906 --> 00:44:11.886 A:middle
So image is replaced multiple

00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:14.516 A:middle
times, so I suspect that our

00:44:14.516 --> 00:44:15.906 A:middle
cancel doesn't really work.

00:44:17.366 --> 00:44:18.846 A:middle
I would like to write modeler

00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:19.736 A:middle
that detects that.

00:44:21.186 --> 00:44:23.746 A:middle
So let's take a look in our

00:44:23.746 --> 00:44:24.736 A:middle
package definition.

00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:27.246 A:middle
We will start by writing modeler

00:44:27.466 --> 00:44:27.916 A:middle
element.

00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:31.336 A:middle
Modeler has identifier, title,

00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:32.366 A:middle
and purpose.

00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:35.316 A:middle
These fields will be extracted

00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:36.406 A:middle
to your documentation.

00:44:37.536 --> 00:44:39.366 A:middle
We specify production system

00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:41.576 A:middle
path which contains all of the

00:44:41.576 --> 00:44:42.756 A:middle
logic for our modeler.

00:44:45.086 --> 00:44:46.986 A:middle
Then, we define output of our

00:44:46.986 --> 00:44:47.466 A:middle
modeler.

00:44:48.086 --> 00:44:49.526 A:middle
It will be downloader narrative

00:44:49.526 --> 00:44:50.006 A:middle
schema.

00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:53.506 A:middle
Required input for our modeler

00:44:53.506 --> 00:44:55.646 A:middle
will be os signpost table.

00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:58.836 A:middle
This table contains begin and

00:44:58.836 --> 00:44:59.686 A:middle
end events.
