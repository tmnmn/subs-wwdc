run into that problem with the

00:55:00.286 --> 00:55:00.746 A:middle
intervals.

00:55:02.926 --> 00:55:04.326 A:middle
That is the end of the session.

00:55:04.896 --> 00:55:08.026 A:middle
So we did a lot of work here to

00:55:08.026 --> 00:55:09.116 A:middle
create the Instruments feature

00:55:09.116 --> 00:55:10.456 A:middle
and we're really, really excited

00:55:10.456 --> 00:55:11.386 A:middle
that we were able to get it out

00:55:11.386 --> 00:55:12.306 A:middle
to you guys this year.

00:55:12.686 --> 00:55:14.636 A:middle
And so we can't wait to see what

00:55:14.636 --> 00:55:15.566 A:middle
you guys are able to accomplish

00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:15.746 A:middle
with it.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.906 A:middle

00:55:17.906 --> 00:55:18.926 A:middle

00:55:18.926 --> 00:55:21.176 A:middle

00:55:21.566 --> 00:55:23.986 A:middle
lab eight today at 3:00 and also

00:55:23.986 --> 00:55:25.916 A:middle
Session 405 goes over in detail

00:55:25.916 --> 00:55:27.256 A:middle
how to use os signpost API which

00:55:27.256 --> 00:55:28.586 A:middle
is a great way to get data into

00:55:28.586 --> 00:55:29.156 A:middle
Instruments.

00:55:29.856 --> 00:55:30.606 A:middle
