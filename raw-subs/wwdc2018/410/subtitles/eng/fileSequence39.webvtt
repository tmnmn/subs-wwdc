00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.836 A:middle
intersect with the current clock

00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:02.406 A:middle
in the modeler.

00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:04.156 A:middle
This is what helps us establish

00:39:04.236 --> 00:39:04.876 A:middle
coincidence.

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:06.606 A:middle
It allows us to prune out the

00:39:06.606 --> 00:39:08.626 A:middle
old data and it also allows us

00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:10.186 A:middle
to see if there are inputs that

00:39:10.186 --> 00:39:13.386 A:middle
are possibly correlated in time.

00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:15.026 A:middle
Now the way that a modeler

00:39:15.156 --> 00:39:16.766 A:middle
reasons about its working memory

00:39:17.066 --> 00:39:19.196 A:middle
is defined by you through what's

00:39:19.196 --> 00:39:20.426 A:middle
called a production system.

00:39:21.496 --> 00:39:23.466 A:middle
Production systems work on facts

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.306 A:middle
in the working memory and

00:39:25.306 --> 00:39:26.486 A:middle
they're defined by rules that

00:39:26.486 --> 00:39:28.176 A:middle
have a left-hand side, a

00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
production operator, and the

00:39:29.706 --> 00:39:30.346 A:middle
right-hand side.

00:39:31.106 --> 00:39:32.896 A:middle
The left-hand side is a pattern

00:39:33.306 --> 00:39:35.106 A:middle
in working memory that has to

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:37.336 A:middle
occur to activate the rule and

00:39:37.336 --> 00:39:38.976 A:middle
the right-hand side are the

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:40.426 A:middle
actions that will happen when

00:39:40.426 --> 00:39:41.576 A:middle
that rule fires.

00:39:42.036 --> 00:39:43.306 A:middle
Now the actions could include

00:39:43.746 --> 00:39:45.686 A:middle
adding a row to an output table

00:39:45.866 --> 00:39:48.476 A:middle
or include asserting a new fact

00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:50.896 A:middle
into the working memory as the

00:39:50.896 --> 00:39:52.566 A:middle
modeling process progresses.

00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:56.826 A:middle
So facts come from two sources.

00:39:56.926 --> 00:39:58.046 A:middle
One, they're from the table

00:39:58.046 --> 00:39:59.566 A:middle
inputs that you saw, so will

00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:01.206 A:middle
automatically assert these as
