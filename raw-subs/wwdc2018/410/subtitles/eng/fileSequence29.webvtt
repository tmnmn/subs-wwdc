00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.296 A:middle
that we passed in os signpost

00:29:00.296 --> 00:29:01.756 A:middle
begin and end calls.

00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:05.966 A:middle
Message element is the same as

00:29:05.966 --> 00:29:07.596 A:middle
the format string you passed but

00:29:07.596 --> 00:29:10.326 A:middle
instead of format arguments, you

00:29:10.326 --> 00:29:12.516 A:middle
pass variables here to capture

00:29:12.516 --> 00:29:14.406 A:middle
the values that you passed when

00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:15.556 A:middle
calling os signpost.

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:18.786 A:middle
Let's take a look at how we fill

00:29:18.786 --> 00:29:20.576 A:middle
out those values in our columns.

00:29:23.926 --> 00:29:26.876 A:middle
Here, you can see status column.

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:28.566 A:middle
It's type of string because it's

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.246 A:middle
either completed or canceled,

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:32.756 A:middle
and we fill it out with the

00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:34.956 A:middle
value of status variable.

00:29:36.676 --> 00:29:38.806 A:middle
Because expression element could

00:29:38.926 --> 00:29:40.826 A:middle
take arbitrary Clips expression,

00:29:41.706 --> 00:29:42.586 A:middle
we could also do more

00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:44.156 A:middle
sophisticated things in it.

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:47.056 A:middle
Here, we could compute event

00:29:47.056 --> 00:29:49.006 A:middle
impact by looking at size.

00:29:49.846 --> 00:29:51.536 A:middle
If it's greater than 3 and 1/2

00:29:51.536 --> 00:29:53.326 A:middle
megabytes, we say that impact is

00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:56.056 A:middle
high, else impact of operation

00:29:56.056 --> 00:29:56.516 A:middle
is low.

00:29:58.076 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
That's our definition for os
