00:48:57.346 --> 00:49:01.386 A:middle
narrative schema, create new row

00:49:01.386 --> 00:49:05.766 A:middle
in it, set time column to the

00:49:05.856 --> 00:49:08.976 A:middle
time of the first fact, and set

00:49:08.976 --> 00:49:10.266 A:middle
your narrative description.

00:49:11.036 --> 00:49:13.796 A:middle
You'll output some information

00:49:13.796 --> 00:49:15.486 A:middle
about the problem so that

00:49:15.846 --> 00:49:19.216 A:middle
someone could debug it later.

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:21.466 A:middle
Now I can run Instrument against

00:49:21.466 --> 00:49:21.916 A:middle
our app.

00:49:22.636 --> 00:49:24.956 A:middle
Let's run it again.

00:49:32.216 --> 00:49:33.946 A:middle
Choose Trailblazer Networking in

00:49:33.946 --> 00:49:38.156 A:middle
template again, and record.

00:49:38.936 --> 00:49:41.766 A:middle
I will try to perform some fast

00:49:41.766 --> 00:49:44.236 A:middle
scrolling here and take a look

00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:44.976 A:middle
at my narrative table.

00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:51.836 A:middle
You can see that narrative table

00:49:51.886 --> 00:49:53.406 A:middle
contains lots of diagnostic

00:49:53.406 --> 00:49:55.066 A:middle
messages being outputted.

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:57.706 A:middle
So we can see that there are

00:49:57.706 --> 00:49:59.126 A:middle
some problems and we can later

00:49:59.126 --> 00:49:59.866 A:middle
investigate it.
