00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:00.456 A:middle
tables with those schemas will

00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
fill in because they either have

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.026 A:middle
modelers defined or we know how

00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:04.866 A:middle
to record it from the data

00:23:04.866 --> 00:23:05.176 A:middle
stream.

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:06.426 A:middle
So these make excellent building

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.766 A:middle
blocks for your own instruments

00:23:08.216 --> 00:23:09.016 A:middle
but even better they make

00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:10.856 A:middle
excellent inputs for writing

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:11.706 A:middle
your own modelers.

00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:14.356 A:middle
Now you write a modeler or you

00:23:14.356 --> 00:23:15.316 A:middle
define a modeler in your

00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:16.896 A:middle
Instruments Package with the

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:19.046 A:middle
modeler element and you can also

00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:22.236 A:middle
create a custom output schema

00:23:22.346 --> 00:23:23.676 A:middle
for that modeler.

00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:25.616 A:middle
You can use the point-schema for

00:23:25.616 --> 00:23:27.336 A:middle
just a single point in time or

00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:28.416 A:middle
you can use the interval schema

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:29.276 A:middle
if you have a point and a

00:23:29.276 --> 00:23:29.726 A:middle
duration.

00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:33.216 A:middle
Now the modeler is able to

00:23:33.216 --> 00:23:35.126 A:middle
define what inputs it needs and

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:36.266 A:middle
this is what tells the binding

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:37.906 A:middle
solution how to fill out the

00:23:37.906 --> 00:23:39.706 A:middle
rest of that data flow graph.

00:23:39.706 --> 00:23:41.976 A:middle
And so your modeler will snap

00:23:41.976 --> 00:23:43.076 A:middle
right into the binding solution.

00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:45.756 A:middle
Now modelers are actually

00:23:45.756 --> 00:23:47.576 A:middle
miniature expert systems and

00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:48.626 A:middle
they are written in the Clips

00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:50.136 A:middle
language, which means that

00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:52.006 A:middle
they're very powerful but

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
they're also pretty advanced.

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:54.346 A:middle
So we're going to save the

00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:55.896 A:middle
details on how to create

00:23:55.896 --> 00:23:57.106 A:middle
modelers for the advanced

00:23:57.106 --> 00:24:00.366 A:middle
section; however, it is really
