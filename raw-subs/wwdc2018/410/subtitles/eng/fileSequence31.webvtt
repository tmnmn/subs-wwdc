00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
Each of our planes will be

00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:03.166 A:middle
colored with column of impact

00:31:03.326 --> 00:31:06.076 A:middle
and label on our plane will be

00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:06.976 A:middle
taken from image size.

00:31:09.436 --> 00:31:12.796 A:middle
Next, we have a list.

00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:14.726 A:middle
You already saw this one in

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:15.526 A:middle
ticks example.

00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:18.176 A:middle
Here, we pass all of the columns

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:21.286 A:middle
that you would like to see.

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:22.766 A:middle
Next, aggregation.

00:31:23.726 --> 00:31:25.266 A:middle
This aggregation will track all

00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:26.406 A:middle
of the completed downloads.

00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:29.836 A:middle
Because our table contains both

00:31:29.836 --> 00:31:31.146 A:middle
completed and canceled

00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:32.406 A:middle
downloads, we need to apply

00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:34.436 A:middle
slice element to filter some of

00:31:34.436 --> 00:31:34.836 A:middle
the data.

00:31:36.016 --> 00:31:37.866 A:middle
In slice element we specify

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:39.456 A:middle
column that slice will be

00:31:39.456 --> 00:31:42.066 A:middle
applied on and predicate value

00:31:42.596 --> 00:31:43.496 A:middle
that has to be matched.

00:31:43.926 --> 00:31:45.546 A:middle
Here, we want to take only

00:31:45.546 --> 00:31:47.056 A:middle
completed rows from this table.

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.746 A:middle
We define hierarchy, which is

00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:52.406 A:middle
only one level hierarchy with

00:31:52.486 --> 00:31:55.276 A:middle
image name and columns that will

00:31:55.276 --> 00:31:55.836 A:middle
be visible.

00:31:56.676 --> 00:31:58.786 A:middle
For each image name, we will

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:02.156 A:middle
specify count and image size.
