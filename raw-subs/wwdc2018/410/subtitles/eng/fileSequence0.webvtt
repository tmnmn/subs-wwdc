00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:27.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright, good morning.

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:28.836 A:middle
My name is Chad Woolf.

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.186 A:middle
I am a performance tools

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:31.706 A:middle
engineer here at Apple and

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:32.886 A:middle
today's session 410.

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:33.976 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.336 A:middle
creating custom instruments in

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:36.706 A:middle
Instruments 10.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:38.666 A:middle
Today's session looks like this.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.576 A:middle
We're going to talk a little bit

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.226 A:middle
about why you might want to

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
create custom instruments.

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:43.526 A:middle
We're going to go over the

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:45.406 A:middle
architecture of Instruments.

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:46.366 A:middle
And we have a lot of content

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.106 A:middle
today, so we have three

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.726 A:middle
sections: Getting Started,

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.256 A:middle
Intermediate, and Advanced.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.626 A:middle
And then on the way out, we'll

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:52.956 A:middle
talk about some best practices,

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:54.036 A:middle
some of the things we've learned

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.546 A:middle
along the way, writing

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:56.346 A:middle
instruments on our own.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.846 A:middle
So the first one, why would you

00:00:58.846 --> 00:00:59.986 A:middle
want to create custom

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
instruments?
