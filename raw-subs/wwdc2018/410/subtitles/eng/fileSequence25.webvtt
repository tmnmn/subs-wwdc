00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:01.956 A:middle
Now in your Instruments Package

00:25:01.956 --> 00:25:03.496 A:middle
definition, you can create an os

00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
signpost interval schema and you

00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:08.126 A:middle
define the name of your schema

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:08.396 A:middle
here.

00:25:09.236 --> 00:25:11.656 A:middle
You select which signpost you

00:25:11.656 --> 00:25:12.726 A:middle
would like to have recorded,

00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:14.626 A:middle
including the signpost name, and

00:25:15.086 --> 00:25:16.806 A:middle
then here you can use a syntax

00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.456 A:middle
to capture the different pieces

00:25:18.456 --> 00:25:20.186 A:middle
of metadata from your start

00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:21.586 A:middle
metadata message.

00:25:21.656 --> 00:25:22.986 A:middle
And here, we're going to take

00:25:23.016 --> 00:25:24.526 A:middle
that captured value and we're

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:25.296 A:middle
going to use that as the

00:25:25.296 --> 00:25:27.016 A:middle
expression to teach us how to

00:25:27.016 --> 00:25:28.956 A:middle
fill in the column for data size

00:25:28.956 --> 00:25:30.106 A:middle
that we just defined in line

00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:30.256 A:middle
here.

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:35.756 A:middle
Now in Session 405, which is

00:25:35.756 --> 00:25:37.686 A:middle
Measuring Performance Using

00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:39.816 A:middle
Logging, I demonstrated the

00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:42.906 A:middle
Trailblazer application and also

00:25:43.216 --> 00:25:44.616 A:middle
showed you an instrument that

00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:46.056 A:middle
you guys could write based on

00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:47.366 A:middle
the signpost inside that.

00:25:47.956 --> 00:25:49.716 A:middle
And now that we know a lot more

00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:50.696 A:middle
about how to write custom

00:25:50.696 --> 00:25:52.406 A:middle
instruments, I'd like to invite

00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:54.696 A:middle
Kacper back on stage to give you

00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:56.136 A:middle
a demonstration and walk-through

00:25:56.386 --> 00:25:57.626 A:middle
of how we created that package.

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:03.126 A:middle
