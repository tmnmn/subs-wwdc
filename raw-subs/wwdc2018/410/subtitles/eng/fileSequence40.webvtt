00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:01.206 A:middle
automatically assert these as

00:40:01.206 --> 00:40:03.336 A:middle
facts using the rules that I

00:40:03.336 --> 00:40:04.246 A:middle
showed you with the modeling

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:06.376 A:middle
clock, and they can also be

00:40:06.376 --> 00:40:07.846 A:middle
produced by assertions from the

00:40:07.846 --> 00:40:09.866 A:middle
right-hand side of a production.

00:40:11.066 --> 00:40:12.196 A:middle
Now if you're going to create

00:40:12.196 --> 00:40:14.336 A:middle
your own facts, Clips allows you

00:40:14.336 --> 00:40:15.316 A:middle
to find what's called a fact

00:40:15.426 --> 00:40:16.106 A:middle
template, which allows you to

00:40:16.106 --> 00:40:17.196 A:middle
provide structure to your fact

00:40:17.196 --> 00:40:17.976 A:middle
and do some basic type checking.

00:40:18.046 --> 00:40:21.306 A:middle
So let's take a look at some

00:40:21.306 --> 00:40:22.356 A:middle
rules in Clips.

00:40:23.226 --> 00:40:24.326 A:middle
Our first rule that we're going

00:40:24.326 --> 00:40:25.466 A:middle
to look at is called found

00:40:25.466 --> 00:40:25.926 A:middle
cause.

00:40:27.306 --> 00:40:30.446 A:middle
And what that says is if there

00:40:30.446 --> 00:40:31.806 A:middle
is an object who's playing with

00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:35.526 A:middle
matches at t1, and the app is on

00:40:35.526 --> 00:40:38.996 A:middle
fire at t2, and t1 happened

00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:41.466 A:middle
before t2, then on the

00:40:41.466 --> 00:40:42.236 A:middle
right-hand side of this

00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:43.756 A:middle
production, we can assert a new

00:40:43.756 --> 00:40:46.026 A:middle
fact called cause of fire with

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.326 A:middle
the object that started the

00:40:47.326 --> 00:40:47.616 A:middle
fire.

00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:49.336 A:middle
Now that will be entered into

00:40:49.426 --> 00:40:50.096 A:middle
the working memory.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:53.156 A:middle
Now we come down to our second

00:40:53.156 --> 00:40:54.666 A:middle
rule, which is called record a

00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:58.296 A:middle
cause, if we have an app on fire

00:40:58.296 --> 00:41:00.166 A:middle
at some start time and we know
