00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:04.916 A:middle
We pass title for a list that

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:06.236 A:middle
will appear in the [inaudible]

00:13:06.366 --> 00:13:11.516 A:middle
of Instrument, table ref, just

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:12.816 A:middle
like for lane element before,

00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:15.646 A:middle
and columns that we would like

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:15.906 A:middle
to see.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.556 A:middle
Now our package is ready to be

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:24.886 A:middle
built, and run in Instruments.

00:13:25.946 --> 00:13:27.656 A:middle
To do this, you will use Xcode

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:28.716 A:middle
scheme run action.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:29.976 A:middle
Let's do it.

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:34.936 A:middle
You can see that build error

00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:35.336 A:middle
appears.

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:37.696 A:middle
You have full ID support when

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:38.916 A:middle
building instruments packages.

00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:41.526 A:middle
Here, error appears in line and

00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:43.426 A:middle
says that column timestamp could

00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:45.386 A:middle
not be found in schema tick.

00:13:45.706 --> 00:13:46.816 A:middle
Oh, that's right, because it's

00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:47.536 A:middle
not timestamp.

00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:48.616 A:middle
It's supposed to be time.

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:52.676 A:middle
I will fix it and run it again.

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:58.256 A:middle
You can see it running because

00:13:58.256 --> 00:13:59.616 A:middle
this new copy of Instruments to

00:13:59.616 --> 00:13:59.796 A:middle
appear.

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:02.226 A:middle
You can recognize the special
