00:29:58.076 --> 00:30:00.236 A:middle
That's our definition for os

00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
signpost interval schema.

00:30:01.106 --> 00:30:03.376 A:middle
Now let's take a look at table

00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:04.066 A:middle
creation.

00:30:05.796 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
For schema ref, we pass

00:30:08.096 --> 00:30:10.456 A:middle
identifier of our os signpost

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:12.616 A:middle
interval schema and create

00:30:12.616 --> 00:30:13.846 A:middle
unique identifier for this

00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:14.686 A:middle
specific table.

00:30:15.906 --> 00:30:17.736 A:middle
Then, we can reference it in our

00:30:17.736 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
UI definitions.

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:22.346 A:middle
For graph, we create a single

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:22.676 A:middle
lane.

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:26.036 A:middle
It takes our table and this time

00:30:26.036 --> 00:30:27.706 A:middle
it graphs by using the plot

00:30:27.706 --> 00:30:28.056 A:middle
template.

00:30:28.796 --> 00:30:30.586 A:middle
Plot template is dynamic way of

00:30:30.586 --> 00:30:31.476 A:middle
creating graphs.

00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:35.446 A:middle
It looks at the table, at the

00:30:35.446 --> 00:30:37.386 A:middle
column that was passed in

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:40.126 A:middle
instance by element and for each

00:30:40.226 --> 00:30:41.966 A:middle
unique value of this column, it

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:44.436 A:middle
creates plot.

00:30:44.606 --> 00:30:46.436 A:middle
Label format element allows us

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:49.606 A:middle
to create format title for this

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:49.966 A:middle
plot.

00:30:50.336 --> 00:30:52.426 A:middle
Here it's img column and the

00:30:52.426 --> 00:30:53.956 A:middle
value from image name column.

00:30:54.516 --> 00:30:57.166 A:middle
We pass image name as a value of

00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:57.656 A:middle
our plot.

00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
Each of our planes will be
