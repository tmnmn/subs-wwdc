00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.036 A:middle
Standard UI, everything in the

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:01.636 A:middle
Analysis Core appears to be a

00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:02.096 A:middle
table.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.166 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit about

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:03.986 A:middle
tables and what they are.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:06.916 A:middle
Tables are collections of rows

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:07.886 A:middle
and they have a structure that's

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.516 A:middle
defined by a table schema.

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:10.746 A:middle
Right, so it's very similar to a

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:11.656 A:middle
database application.

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.106 A:middle
The schema defines the columns

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:15.396 A:middle
and the names of the columns and

00:07:15.396 --> 00:07:16.236 A:middle
also the types.

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:18.246 A:middle
Now the Analysis Core uses a

00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:19.606 A:middle
very rich typing system called

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.296 A:middle
an engineering type and that

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.446 A:middle
both tells us how to store the

00:07:22.446 --> 00:07:24.216 A:middle
data and also how to visualize

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:25.236 A:middle
it and analyze it in the

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:25.806 A:middle
Standard UI.

00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:29.886 A:middle
Now in addition to or while the

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:31.426 A:middle
schema describes the structure

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.246 A:middle
of a table, you can use

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.516 A:middle
attributes which are key/value

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:36.146 A:middle
pairs to describe the content.

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:37.586 A:middle
So that kind of helps us

00:07:37.586 --> 00:07:38.616 A:middle
describe what goes into the

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:38.986 A:middle
table.

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:42.216 A:middle
You can think of schemas as like

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:44.606 A:middle
a class in Objective-C or Swift

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:45.596 A:middle
whereas the rows are like the

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:46.246 A:middle
instances.

00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:47.886 A:middle
And so it's important that your

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:50.236 A:middle
schema names are singular, just

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.296 A:middle
like we have class names in

00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:53.516 A:middle
Objective-C that are singular,

00:07:53.516 --> 00:07:55.416 A:middle
like NSString instead of

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.056 A:middle
strings.

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.136 A:middle
So this will be more important

00:07:58.136 --> 00:07:58.906 A:middle
when we get to the advanced

00:07:58.906 --> 00:07:59.876 A:middle
section but I wanted to call it

00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.496 A:middle
out now so we can know what
