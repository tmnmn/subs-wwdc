00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:03.086 A:middle
You can see that narrative is

00:50:03.176 --> 00:50:04.186 A:middle
interactive detail.

00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:06.526 A:middle
You could for example check all

00:50:06.526 --> 00:50:07.746 A:middle
of the arguments being passed

00:50:07.876 --> 00:50:09.066 A:middle
and you can filter.

00:50:09.496 --> 00:50:11.586 A:middle
So we can add this caller

00:50:11.586 --> 00:50:13.826 A:middle
address as a detail filter and

00:50:13.826 --> 00:50:15.476 A:middle
have this detail filter.

00:50:17.476 --> 00:50:19.386 A:middle
Now, let's back to Chad who will

00:50:19.386 --> 00:50:21.146 A:middle
tell you more about some best

00:50:21.216 --> 00:50:22.696 A:middle
practices when developing

00:50:22.736 --> 00:50:23.446 A:middle
instruments.

00:50:24.516 --> 00:50:29.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:50:30.396 --> 00:50:30.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:50:30.646 --> 00:50:31.326 A:middle
Thank you, Kacper.

00:50:32.076 --> 00:50:34.616 A:middle
So we've seen how we can create

00:50:34.616 --> 00:50:36.546 A:middle
some basic expert systems in

00:50:36.546 --> 00:50:37.016 A:middle
Instruments.

00:50:37.106 --> 00:50:39.656 A:middle
Alright, so let's talk about

00:50:39.826 --> 00:50:42.316 A:middle
some best practices that we've

00:50:42.316 --> 00:50:43.156 A:middle
learned along the way.

00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:46.796 A:middle
And the first one is to write

00:50:46.796 --> 00:50:47.986 A:middle
more than one instrument.

00:50:48.236 --> 00:50:49.566 A:middle
Now I don't mean get practice

00:50:49.566 --> 00:50:50.286 A:middle
writing instruments.

00:50:50.776 --> 00:50:52.146 A:middle
What I mean is that if you own

00:50:52.146 --> 00:50:52.926 A:middle
an instrument already and you

00:50:52.926 --> 00:50:54.096 A:middle
want to add some features to it,

00:50:54.396 --> 00:50:55.486 A:middle
sometimes it's really tempting

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:56.826 A:middle
to just add them, add extra

00:50:56.826 --> 00:50:57.826 A:middle
graphs or details to your

00:50:57.826 --> 00:50:59.346 A:middle
instrument, but you should

00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:00.306 A:middle
really be thinking, you know,
