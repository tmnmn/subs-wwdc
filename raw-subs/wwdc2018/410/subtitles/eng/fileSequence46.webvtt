00:46:00.256 --> 00:46:01.826 A:middle
To do this, I will create file

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:03.736 A:middle
that I previously referenced in

00:46:03.736 --> 00:46:04.766 A:middle
modeler definition.

00:46:05.566 --> 00:46:07.256 A:middle
To create Clips file, you go to

00:46:07.256 --> 00:46:12.796 A:middle
File, New, select macOS

00:46:14.276 --> 00:46:15.786 A:middle
platform, Other section, and

00:46:15.786 --> 00:46:16.366 A:middle
Clips file.

00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:19.976 A:middle
I will fill out the name

00:46:23.976 --> 00:46:27.586 A:middle
and create.

00:46:27.966 --> 00:46:30.286 A:middle
So algorithm for detecting

00:46:30.286 --> 00:46:31.936 A:middle
whether one cell is doing more

00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:33.486 A:middle
than one request at a time will

00:46:33.486 --> 00:46:34.256 A:middle
be as follows.

00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:37.036 A:middle
We'll be tracking every request

00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:38.756 A:middle
as a fact in working memory.

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.856 A:middle
Firstly, we need to create

00:46:41.046 --> 00:46:42.946 A:middle
template for this fact.

00:46:44.376 --> 00:46:47.696 A:middle
So every fact will be storing

00:46:47.786 --> 00:46:49.996 A:middle
time, caller address, which is

00:46:49.996 --> 00:46:53.236 A:middle
cell address, signpost id that

00:46:53.236 --> 00:46:56.286 A:middle
we captured, and the image name

00:46:56.286 --> 00:46:57.286 A:middle
that we are requesting.

00:46:57.806 --> 00:46:59.346 A:middle
We will call this fact started

00:46:59.406 --> 00:46:59.796 A:middle
download.
