00:36:58.166 --> 00:37:00.256 A:middle
Let's walk over like a really

00:37:00.406 --> 00:37:01.766 A:middle
kind of playful example of how

00:37:01.766 --> 00:37:03.336 A:middle
you might use a modeler.

00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:05.966 A:middle
So let's say you define a schema

00:37:06.106 --> 00:37:07.406 A:middle
called playing with matches,

00:37:07.636 --> 00:37:07.906 A:middle
right.

00:37:08.006 --> 00:37:10.166 A:middle
This is an os signpost interval

00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:12.666 A:middle
schema and it's for an os

00:37:12.876 --> 00:37:14.156 A:middle
signpost that you've defined

00:37:14.156 --> 00:37:15.036 A:middle
where you're going to do some

00:37:15.036 --> 00:37:16.816 A:middle
sort of dangerous operation in

00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:17.226 A:middle
your code.

00:37:17.726 --> 00:37:19.996 A:middle
And we define another schema

00:37:20.156 --> 00:37:21.766 A:middle
called app on fire, right.

00:37:22.186 --> 00:37:23.916 A:middle
It's also a signpost schema but

00:37:24.066 --> 00:37:25.206 A:middle
these signposts mean that the

00:37:25.206 --> 00:37:27.386 A:middle
application has entered into a

00:37:27.386 --> 00:37:28.986 A:middle
bad state and we really want to

00:37:28.986 --> 00:37:29.396 A:middle
know why.

00:37:30.406 --> 00:37:31.816 A:middle
So you create an output schema,

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.306 A:middle
which is a point schema, that's

00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:34.426 A:middle
going to hold the object that

00:37:34.426 --> 00:37:35.836 A:middle
was playing with matches and the

00:37:35.836 --> 00:37:37.476 A:middle
time at which the fire started.

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:38.676 A:middle
We are going to call that the

00:37:38.676 --> 00:37:39.796 A:middle
started a fire schema.

00:37:39.796 --> 00:37:43.376 A:middle
Now the modeler's world looks

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:44.066 A:middle
like this.

00:37:44.226 --> 00:37:46.686 A:middle
So we have all of our inputs set

00:37:46.686 --> 00:37:48.486 A:middle
up in time order ready to go and

00:37:48.486 --> 00:37:51.096 A:middle
this dashed line on the left is

00:37:51.096 --> 00:37:52.436 A:middle
what's called the modeler's

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:53.126 A:middle
clock.

00:37:54.136 --> 00:37:55.976 A:middle
Now when we grab the first input

00:37:55.976 --> 00:37:57.206 A:middle
and we enter that into the

00:37:57.206 --> 00:37:58.636 A:middle
working memory, the modeler's

00:37:58.686 --> 00:37:59.686 A:middle
clock moves to the start of that

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:03.076 A:middle
interval and then we grab the
