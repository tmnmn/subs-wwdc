00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:01.626 A:middle
Xcode has created project with

00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:03.656 A:middle
package target and one file,

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:05.706 A:middle
package definition.

00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:09.286 A:middle
Let's look in to it.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.996 A:middle
Packages are described in

00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:13.406 A:middle
XML-based syntax.

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:15.626 A:middle
At the beginning, each package

00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:18.506 A:middle
contains identifier, title, and

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:18.846 A:middle
owner.

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:21.146 A:middle
These fields will be visible

00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:22.436 A:middle
when someone attempts to install

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:23.076 A:middle
your package.

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.466 A:middle
Usually, you would start by

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.736 A:middle
defining your own schema and

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.546 A:middle
optionally modeler but because

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
here we are going to be using

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.776 A:middle
predefined tick schema, let's

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.576 A:middle
remove these guides.

00:10:38.876 --> 00:10:41.416 A:middle
To import tick schema from base

00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:43.176 A:middle
package, all you need to do is

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:44.926 A:middle
to specify import schema element

00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:48.596 A:middle
and first name of the schema,

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:48.976 A:middle
tick.

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:55.546 A:middle
Now it's ready to be used by our

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:56.156 A:middle
Instrument.

00:10:58.516 --> 00:11:00.636 A:middle
To make defining more complex
