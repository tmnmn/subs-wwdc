00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:02.226 A:middle
You can recognize the special

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:03.786 A:middle
copy by having different icon.

00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:06.656 A:middle
It loads your package temporally

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.226 A:middle
only for this run session.

00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:10.516 A:middle
It allows you to iterate on your

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.446 A:middle
package more easily.

00:14:12.066 --> 00:14:15.666 A:middle
To be sure that your package is

00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.356 A:middle
already loaded, we can check it

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.346 A:middle
out in New Package Management

00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:19.686 A:middle
UI.

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:22.386 A:middle
You can find it in Instruments

00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:24.536 A:middle
Preferences and Packages

00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:25.176 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:29.556 A:middle
You can see our newly created

00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:31.746 A:middle
package here along debug batch,

00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:33.466 A:middle
which means that it's loaded

00:14:33.466 --> 00:14:35.736 A:middle
only temporarily.

00:14:35.736 --> 00:14:37.296 A:middle
You see also all of the system

00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:37.996 A:middle
packages here.

00:14:38.396 --> 00:14:39.916 A:middle
You can use and link against

00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
them using subtitle, visible

00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:42.196 A:middle
here.

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:46.576 A:middle
Our ticks package contains ticks

00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:47.126 A:middle
instrument.

00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:52.416 A:middle
So let's test it now using blank

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:52.776 A:middle
template.

00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:55.566 A:middle
I will switch my target to my

00:14:55.566 --> 00:14:55.966 A:middle
MacBook
