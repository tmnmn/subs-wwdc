00:48:58.576 --> 00:49:00.626 A:middle
is really difficult to catch

00:49:02.036 --> 00:49:04.046 A:middle
during normal testing but is

00:49:04.046 --> 00:49:05.906 A:middle
made obvious once you have the

00:49:06.006 --> 00:49:06.966 A:middle
data from the field.

00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:10.126 A:middle
That's the power of Energy Logs,

00:49:11.156 --> 00:49:12.586 A:middle
and that's the power of Energy

00:49:12.586 --> 00:49:13.146 A:middle
Organizer.

00:49:14.636 --> 00:49:15.776 A:middle
Let's take a look at the three

00:49:15.776 --> 00:49:17.126 A:middle
key takeaways from this demo.

00:49:17.696 --> 00:49:20.486 A:middle
You can use the Energy Organizer

00:49:20.486 --> 00:49:22.796 A:middle
to discover top energy issues in

00:49:22.796 --> 00:49:23.226 A:middle
the field.

00:49:24.366 --> 00:49:25.776 A:middle
Take a look at the top issues,

00:49:26.256 --> 00:49:27.436 A:middle
take a look at how often they're

00:49:27.436 --> 00:49:29.616 A:middle
happening, and take a look at

00:49:29.616 --> 00:49:31.076 A:middle
what kind of devices and builds

00:49:31.076 --> 00:49:31.676 A:middle
are affected.

00:49:32.896 --> 00:49:35.076 A:middle
Second, you can view energy

00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:37.206 A:middle
hotspots using the weighted call

00:49:37.206 --> 00:49:37.626 A:middle
graphs.

00:49:38.596 --> 00:49:39.946 A:middle
So, look out for the frames with

00:49:40.016 --> 00:49:41.416 A:middle
unusually high sample counts,

00:49:42.686 --> 00:49:44.176 A:middle
and watch out for the unexpected

00:49:44.176 --> 00:49:44.676 A:middle
workloads.

00:49:45.996 --> 00:49:49.256 A:middle
Finally, use OpenEnd Project to

00:49:49.256 --> 00:49:50.646 A:middle
jump directly into your code so

00:49:51.206 --> 00:49:54.016 A:middle
you can make and inspect fixes

00:49:55.046 --> 00:49:55.716 A:middle
with what's going on.

00:49:57.166 --> 00:49:59.326 A:middle
Let's summarize what we've

00:49:59.326 --> 00:50:00.000 A:middle
learned today.
