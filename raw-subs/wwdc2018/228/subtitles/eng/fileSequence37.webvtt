00:36:59.326 --> 00:37:00.916 A:middle
example, on an iPhone versus an

00:37:00.966 --> 00:37:03.876 A:middle
iPad and on, say, Build 30 of

00:37:03.876 --> 00:37:04.226 A:middle
you app.

00:37:05.596 --> 00:37:06.966 A:middle
The third and most important

00:37:06.966 --> 00:37:08.426 A:middle
piece of information is the

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:09.996 A:middle
weighted call graph that will

00:37:09.996 --> 00:37:11.516 A:middle
show you the energy hotspots in

00:37:11.516 --> 00:37:11.916 A:middle
your code.

00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:14.256 A:middle
So, let's talk a little bit more

00:37:14.256 --> 00:37:15.366 A:middle
about the weighted call graph,

00:37:16.126 --> 00:37:17.896 A:middle
how it was generated, and how

00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:19.386 A:middle
you can use it to debug energy

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:19.796 A:middle
issues.

00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:24.626 A:middle
Let's say your program is

00:37:24.626 --> 00:37:26.846 A:middle
comprised of a main function and

00:37:26.846 --> 00:37:28.406 A:middle
a number of methods, Method 1,

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.436 A:middle
Method 2, Method 3, and Method

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:30.776 A:middle
4.

00:37:31.286 --> 00:37:35.046 A:middle
Your code begins to execute

00:37:35.496 --> 00:37:37.316 A:middle
until a high CPU energy event is

00:37:37.316 --> 00:37:37.806 A:middle
detected.

00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:42.516 A:middle
Up to this point, backtraces are

00:37:42.516 --> 00:37:44.686 A:middle
continuously sampled at a

00:37:44.686 --> 00:37:46.406 A:middle
periodic interval of once per

00:37:46.406 --> 00:37:49.916 A:middle
second, where each backtrace is

00:37:49.916 --> 00:37:53.446 A:middle
a sample of an active frames in

00:37:53.446 --> 00:37:54.096 A:middle
execution.

00:37:55.576 --> 00:37:57.026 A:middle
The first backtrace, for

00:37:57.026 --> 00:37:59.606 A:middle
example, shows that main Method

00:37:59.606 --> 00:38:01.986 A:middle
1 and Method 2 were active.
