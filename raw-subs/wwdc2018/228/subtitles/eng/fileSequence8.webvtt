00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:00.776 A:middle
resources efficiently.

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:04.166 A:middle
So, with that being said, let's

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:05.926 A:middle
take a look at some examples of

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.706 A:middle
real-world situations where we

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:08.656 A:middle
can think about energy

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.636 A:middle
efficiency and really start this

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:11.356 A:middle
process off.

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:13.696 A:middle
Let's talk about when our app is

00:08:13.696 --> 00:08:14.336 A:middle
in the foreground.

00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:16.186 A:middle
When our app is in the

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:17.816 A:middle
foreground, it will likely be

00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:18.816 A:middle
providing the main user

00:08:18.816 --> 00:08:19.496 A:middle
experience.

00:08:19.776 --> 00:08:21.126 A:middle
For many of us, this is the most

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.166 A:middle
important and critical part of

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:22.896 A:middle
our application.

00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:25.986 A:middle
With that being said, energy

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:27.146 A:middle
efficiency in the foreground is

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:28.496 A:middle
about focusing on providing

00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:30.726 A:middle
value to your user, ensuring

00:08:30.726 --> 00:08:31.696 A:middle
that whatever you're doing

00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:33.326 A:middle
provides some immediate impact

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:34.846 A:middle
for the user experience.

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.796 A:middle
One tenet we can follow is to

00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:39.106 A:middle
only do work when required.

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:41.226 A:middle
Sounds pretty straightforward.

00:08:42.176 --> 00:08:43.616 A:middle
Well, let's take a look at an

00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:45.246 A:middle
example and illustrate why this

00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:45.906 A:middle
is so important.

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.096 A:middle
Let's say you're building a

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:49.826 A:middle
media application, and the

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:50.886 A:middle
primary goal of the media

00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:52.336 A:middle
application is to present

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:54.056 A:middle
content to the user at a regular

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:54.606 A:middle
cadence.

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:57.666 A:middle
Well, a really robust solution

00:08:57.756 --> 00:08:59.186 A:middle
would be to implement a sort of

00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:00.736 A:middle
timer-based approach to refresh
