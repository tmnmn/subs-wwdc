00:18:01.136 --> 00:18:03.346 A:middle
So, we've talked about some ways

00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:04.336 A:middle
that we can start thinking about

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:05.966 A:middle
energy efficiency as a process.

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:08.076 A:middle
If we focus on optimizing the

00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:09.616 A:middle
work we do in all of our use

00:18:09.616 --> 00:18:12.176 A:middle
cases, we can really work on

00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:13.396 A:middle
optimizing the energy that our

00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:14.536 A:middle
application consumes.

00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:17.826 A:middle
For a deeper dive into the

00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:18.996 A:middle
things we talked about and to

00:18:18.996 --> 00:18:19.916 A:middle
maybe get a little bit more

00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:21.436 A:middle
hands-on with the code behind

00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:22.566 A:middle
some of these optimizations we

00:18:22.566 --> 00:18:24.346 A:middle
discussed, I really recommend

00:18:24.346 --> 00:18:25.276 A:middle
that you check out our video

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:26.736 A:middle
from last year, How to write

00:18:26.736 --> 00:18:27.786 A:middle
energy-efficient apps.

00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:29.896 A:middle
In that session, you'll find

00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:30.506 A:middle
that there are a lot of

00:18:30.506 --> 00:18:32.386 A:middle
interesting resources and more

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.606 A:middle
examples on how you can use

00:18:34.606 --> 00:18:35.846 A:middle
energy-efficient designs in your

00:18:35.846 --> 00:18:36.356 A:middle
application.

00:18:40.316 --> 00:18:42.026 A:middle
So, now that we've talked about

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:43.346 A:middle
some ways that we can improve

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.536 A:middle
energy efficiency in the design

00:18:44.536 --> 00:18:46.676 A:middle
of our application, and we've

00:18:46.836 --> 00:18:48.266 A:middle
spent a lot of time talking

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:49.856 A:middle
about ways that we can improve

00:18:50.506 --> 00:18:51.746 A:middle
our energy efficiency through

00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:53.426 A:middle
thinking about the hardware

00:18:53.426 --> 00:18:54.936 A:middle
systems behind our application,

00:18:55.776 --> 00:18:56.756 A:middle
what are the ways that we can

00:18:56.756 --> 00:18:57.576 A:middle
quantify this?

00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:59.116 A:middle
Let's say we've made a change,

00:18:59.116 --> 00:19:00.506 A:middle
and we want to understand the
