00:44:58.216 --> 00:45:00.026 A:middle
logs should look fairly similar

00:45:00.026 --> 00:45:01.016 A:middle
to you.

00:45:02.676 --> 00:45:05.836 A:middle
This button here, when I click

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:08.116 A:middle
it, shows that all the system

00:45:08.596 --> 00:45:10.836 A:middle
library frames that were hidden

00:45:10.836 --> 00:45:11.416 A:middle
previously.

00:45:11.926 --> 00:45:15.236 A:middle
And this button here clicks all,

00:45:15.866 --> 00:45:17.906 A:middle
shows you all the frames that

00:45:17.906 --> 00:45:19.056 A:middle
had low sample counts.

00:45:19.996 --> 00:45:21.566 A:middle
Now, by default, we've hidden

00:45:21.996 --> 00:45:24.066 A:middle
most of these frames for you so

00:45:24.066 --> 00:45:25.436 A:middle
that we only show you the most

00:45:25.436 --> 00:45:27.000 A:middle
important frames.

00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:35.366 A:middle
Let's take a look at this

00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:35.796 A:middle
function.

00:45:38.406 --> 00:45:39.966 A:middle
It looks like a lot of time is

00:45:39.966 --> 00:45:41.606 A:middle
being spent in this heavy timer

00:45:41.606 --> 00:45:42.086 A:middle
function.

00:45:43.056 --> 00:45:44.426 A:middle
Actually, I heard Phil talking

00:45:44.426 --> 00:45:46.196 A:middle
about this bug off stage, and he

00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:47.186 A:middle
said that he was going to take a

00:45:47.186 --> 00:45:48.586 A:middle
look at it, so I'll let him deal

00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:49.426 A:middle
with it.

00:45:50.236 --> 00:45:52.506 A:middle
I can go ahead and rename this

00:45:56.556 --> 00:45:57.996 A:middle
and move on to the next bug.

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:00.306 A:middle
Let's take a look at one more
