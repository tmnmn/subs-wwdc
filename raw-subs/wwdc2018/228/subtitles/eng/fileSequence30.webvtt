00:30:00.456 --> 00:30:01.566 A:middle
So, I'll go ahead and comment

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:04.466 A:middle
this out because I love

00:30:04.466 --> 00:30:05.766 A:middle
commenting out code instead of

00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:08.196 A:middle
deleting it, and I'll go ahead

00:30:08.196 --> 00:30:10.036 A:middle
and rebuild Energy Game.

00:30:13.276 --> 00:30:14.416 A:middle
We'll just jump back into the

00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:15.816 A:middle
gauges to see that everything is

00:30:15.816 --> 00:30:18.626 A:middle
okay, and now we'll go ahead and

00:30:22.556 --> 00:30:23.696 A:middle
inject Bug1 again, and I'll go

00:30:24.216 --> 00:30:25.000 A:middle
to the background.

00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:30.706 A:middle
And we see our expected

00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:32.316 A:middle
networking activity but no CPU

00:30:32.316 --> 00:30:32.606 A:middle
spin.

00:30:33.596 --> 00:30:35.796 A:middle
Voila! We've solved it, using

00:30:35.796 --> 00:30:38.656 A:middle
two tools in about 30 seconds or

00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:38.916 A:middle
a minute.

00:30:39.476 --> 00:30:41.076 A:middle
That's the power of these tools.

00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:42.386 A:middle
They're able to let you rapidly

00:30:42.386 --> 00:30:43.786 A:middle
iterate and root cause problems

00:30:43.786 --> 00:30:45.026 A:middle
that you might face on

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:46.406 A:middle
day-to-day development.

00:30:46.976 --> 00:30:49.000 A:middle
So, let's go back to the slides.

00:30:54.696 --> 00:30:56.056 A:middle
So, there's some takeaways from

00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:56.496 A:middle
this demo.

00:30:58.336 --> 00:30:59.716 A:middle
The first takeaway is that the

00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:01.336 A:middle
gauges, as we said, are great
