Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.356 A:middle
My name is Phil Azar, and I'm a

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.466 A:middle
software engineer on the Power

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.036 A:middle
Team at Apple.

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:33.426 A:middle
Today, along with my colleague,

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:35.166 A:middle
David, I'm excited to share with

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.776 A:middle
you what's new in energy

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:37.206 A:middle
debugging.

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:42.206 A:middle
Battery life is hugely important

00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:42.956 A:middle
to our customers.

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:45.296 A:middle
The Power Team strives to make

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:46.406 A:middle
sure that everyone can get

00:00:46.406 --> 00:00:47.466 A:middle
through the day on a single

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.996 A:middle
charge without having to plug

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:49.606 A:middle
their device in.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.566 A:middle
We work with our developers here

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.386 A:middle
at Apple to try and optimize

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.206 A:middle
battery life by guiding them and

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:57.796 A:middle
helping them make design choices

00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:59.346 A:middle
that are energy efficient.
