UIKit, or VOIP and PushKit.

00:16:00.996 --> 00:16:04.766 A:middle
And these APIs have ways for you

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:06.036 A:middle
as an app developer to indicate

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:07.376 A:middle
that you no longer need to run

00:16:07.376 --> 00:16:10.956 A:middle
in the background.

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:12.706 A:middle
So, it stands to reason that as

00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:13.626 A:middle
an app developer, if you're

00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:14.586 A:middle
using any of these background

00:16:14.586 --> 00:16:16.536 A:middle
modes, you would call these

00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:17.786 A:middle
completion handlers, let's say,

00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:18.976 A:middle
to let the system know you're

00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:19.236 A:middle
done.

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:21.536 A:middle
Well, that doesn't always

00:16:21.536 --> 00:16:23.346 A:middle
happen, and in a lot of cases,

00:16:23.846 --> 00:16:25.906 A:middle
we might actually forget or not

00:16:25.906 --> 00:16:26.936 A:middle
want to end our task.

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:29.276 A:middle
So, we let our tasks expire.

00:16:30.576 --> 00:16:32.316 A:middle
There's a great energy impact to

00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:35.606 A:middle
this, and it's really something

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:37.456 A:middle
that people don't necessarily

00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:38.506 A:middle
see when they're developing

00:16:38.506 --> 00:16:39.126 A:middle
their application.

00:16:40.246 --> 00:16:41.436 A:middle
Let me demonstrate why this is

00:16:41.436 --> 00:16:42.506 A:middle
energy inefficient with the

00:16:42.506 --> 00:16:43.286 A:middle
power over time curve.

00:16:44.746 --> 00:16:45.916 A:middle
You could imagine if you enter

00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:47.086 A:middle
the background for any reason

00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:48.746 A:middle
and your task starts, you finish

00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:49.736 A:middle
some time afterwards.

00:16:50.436 --> 00:16:52.576 A:middle
Then, if we let our task expire,

00:16:52.726 --> 00:16:54.466 A:middle
as we've said, we enter this

00:16:54.466 --> 00:16:55.806 A:middle
sort of idle phase where you're

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.326 A:middle
consuming energy and our app is

00:16:57.326 --> 00:16:58.306 A:middle
running in the background for

00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:00.206 A:middle
whatever reason we've asked our
