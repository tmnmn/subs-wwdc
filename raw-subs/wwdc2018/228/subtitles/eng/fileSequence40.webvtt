00:39:58.856 --> 00:40:01.096 A:middle
we will aggregate these logs for

00:40:01.096 --> 00:40:03.556 A:middle
you, sort them, and present them

00:40:03.556 --> 00:40:05.766 A:middle
in a list of top energy issues

00:40:05.766 --> 00:40:06.246 A:middle
to you.

00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:08.886 A:middle
And you can download and view

00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:10.956 A:middle
these logs using the new Xcode

00:40:11.016 --> 00:40:12.436 A:middle
Energy Organizer tool.

00:40:12.976 --> 00:40:16.316 A:middle
The Xcode Energy Organizer is

00:40:16.316 --> 00:40:17.816 A:middle
your command center for

00:40:17.816 --> 00:40:19.766 A:middle
debugging energy issues in the

00:40:19.766 --> 00:40:20.206 A:middle
wild.

00:40:21.536 --> 00:40:23.296 A:middle
Energy Organizer makes it really

00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:25.036 A:middle
easy to view energy logs.

00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:27.706 A:middle
The Energy Organizer is

00:40:27.706 --> 00:40:29.216 A:middle
connected to TestFlight in the

00:40:29.216 --> 00:40:31.086 A:middle
App Store, so you'll see a list

00:40:31.086 --> 00:40:32.386 A:middle
of all your iOS apps.

00:40:32.886 --> 00:40:36.466 A:middle
You'll be able to see some

00:40:36.466 --> 00:40:38.446 A:middle
statistics of how often these

00:40:38.446 --> 00:40:40.336 A:middle
energy issues occur in the wild.

00:40:40.336 --> 00:40:43.486 A:middle
You'll have a list of the top

00:40:43.486 --> 00:40:45.076 A:middle
energy issues sorted by how many

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:46.446 A:middle
devices that was impacted.

00:40:46.916 --> 00:40:49.286 A:middle
You'll have a view of the

00:40:49.286 --> 00:40:51.216 A:middle
weighted call graph for a number

00:40:51.216 --> 00:40:52.826 A:middle
of different logs, which you'll

00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:54.436 A:middle
be able to page through, using

00:40:54.436 --> 00:40:58.036 A:middle
page through logs, and you can

00:40:58.036 --> 00:40:59.946 A:middle
use Open in Project to jump

00:40:59.946 --> 00:41:01.556 A:middle
directly into your code base so
