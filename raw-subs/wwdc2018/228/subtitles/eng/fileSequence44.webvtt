00:44:04.316 --> 00:44:05.856 A:middle
I can go ahead and click this

00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:08.326 A:middle
button here and mark this issue

00:44:08.326 --> 00:44:08.976 A:middle
as resolved.

00:44:10.216 --> 00:44:11.656 A:middle
And what this does is the next

00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:12.606 A:middle
time we open the Energy

00:44:12.606 --> 00:44:14.626 A:middle
Organizer, we'll see that we've

00:44:14.626 --> 00:44:15.656 A:middle
already taken care of this

00:44:15.656 --> 00:44:16.026 A:middle
issue.

00:44:16.576 --> 00:44:18.936 A:middle
All right, let's jump to the

00:44:18.936 --> 00:44:20.606 A:middle
second issue, which hit 42

00:44:20.606 --> 00:44:21.126 A:middle
devices.

00:44:21.736 --> 00:44:23.716 A:middle
Now, before going into the

00:44:23.716 --> 00:44:24.926 A:middle
weighted call graph, I'd like to

00:44:24.926 --> 00:44:26.086 A:middle
draw your attention to three

00:44:26.086 --> 00:44:27.366 A:middle
features at the bottom here.

00:44:29.576 --> 00:44:32.436 A:middle
First is this page through logs

00:44:33.826 --> 00:44:35.236 A:middle
where I can select one out of

00:44:35.336 --> 00:44:37.526 A:middle
five sample energy logs out of

00:44:37.526 --> 00:44:38.656 A:middle
the 42 that we've hit in the

00:44:38.656 --> 00:44:38.996 A:middle
wild.

00:44:38.996 --> 00:44:44.936 A:middle
As I page through these, you can

00:44:44.936 --> 00:44:46.536 A:middle
see that the weighted call graph

00:44:46.536 --> 00:44:47.596 A:middle
looks a little bit different,

00:44:48.256 --> 00:44:50.496 A:middle
which is okay because these

00:44:50.546 --> 00:44:51.816 A:middle
backtraces and these weighted

00:44:51.816 --> 00:44:53.246 A:middle
call graphs are samples.

00:44:54.586 --> 00:44:55.966 A:middle
However, we've grouped these

00:44:55.996 --> 00:44:58.216 A:middle
together by similarity, so these

00:44:58.216 --> 00:45:00.026 A:middle
logs should look fairly similar
