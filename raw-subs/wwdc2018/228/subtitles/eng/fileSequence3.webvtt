00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.996 A:middle
Then, when your app is idle but

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:03.346 A:middle
still running, the power

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:04.396 A:middle
consumption drops.

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:07.326 A:middle
Finally, when your app is

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:09.106 A:middle
suspended, there's still a basal

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.256 A:middle
level of power consumption, and

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:12.226 A:middle
that's interesting to note.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:14.786 A:middle
When your app is doing any of

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:16.036 A:middle
the work that it's been designed

00:03:16.036 --> 00:03:17.536 A:middle
to do, it's going to be asking

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:19.186 A:middle
the system to bring up hardware

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:20.946 A:middle
that it needs to do that work,

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:23.946 A:middle
and the energy associated with

00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:25.156 A:middle
that hardware being brought up

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:27.106 A:middle
and used is called overhead.

00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:29.176 A:middle
Your app doesn't have direct

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:31.146 A:middle
control over overhead, but it

00:03:31.146 --> 00:03:33.186 A:middle
really does influence through

00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:35.706 A:middle
anything that it does.

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:37.076 A:middle
Then, when your apps first

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:38.086 A:middle
utilize those hardware

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:40.156 A:middle
resources, this is called active

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:40.556 A:middle
energy.

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:42.936 A:middle
So, now, your app has access to,

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:44.916 A:middle
let's say, the radio or has

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:45.786 A:middle
access to, let's say, the

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:47.426 A:middle
camera, and it's using that

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:50.066 A:middle
subsystem, this energy being

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:51.256 A:middle
consumed is going to be called

00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:52.016 A:middle
active energy.

00:03:53.136 --> 00:03:54.396 A:middle
So, then, it stands to reason

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:56.376 A:middle
that the battery life problem is

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:57.966 A:middle
actually a two-part optimization

00:03:57.966 --> 00:03:58.356 A:middle
problem.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:03:59.876 A:middle
We have to think about being

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:01.076 A:middle
efficient about the active
