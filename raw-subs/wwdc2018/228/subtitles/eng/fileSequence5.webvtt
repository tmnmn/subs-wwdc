00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:01.546 A:middle
be highly dependent on the code

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:02.786 A:middle
that your app is executing and

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:03.856 A:middle
the workload that you've asked

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:04.726 A:middle
your app to perform.

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:07.656 A:middle
So, in a nutshell, the more

00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:09.116 A:middle
operations and code your app

00:05:09.116 --> 00:05:10.976 A:middle
executes, the more energy it

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.156 A:middle
will consume in the form of

00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:13.306 A:middle
processing.

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:16.016 A:middle
Networking is the next major

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.226 A:middle
subsystem that we think about

00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:18.796 A:middle
when we talk about what consumes

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:22.326 A:middle
energy on our devices.

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:23.736 A:middle
Networking energy is what you

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:24.356 A:middle
might imagine.

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:26.476 A:middle
Whenever your app asks to do any

00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:27.956 A:middle
form of networking over

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:29.966 A:middle
cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth,

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:31.966 A:middle
it's going to consumer energy in

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:32.826 A:middle
the form of networking.

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:35.096 A:middle
This energy is

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:35.956 A:middle
traffic-dependent.

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:37.806 A:middle
The more traffic that your app

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:39.286 A:middle
asks to be sent over any of

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:40.746 A:middle
these technologies, the more

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:41.736 A:middle
energy it will consume.

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:44.876 A:middle
So, put it bluntly, the more

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.146 A:middle
network requests that your app

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.896 A:middle
asks for, the more energy you'll

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.286 A:middle
consume in networking.

00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:52.496 A:middle
Location follows suit but it's a

00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:53.026 A:middle
little different.

00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:56.096 A:middle
In a location subsystem, when

00:05:56.096 --> 00:05:57.986 A:middle
your app asks to fix location

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular,
