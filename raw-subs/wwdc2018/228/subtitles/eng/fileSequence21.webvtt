00:20:58.646 --> 00:21:00.896 A:middle
identify if you have an excess

00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:02.226 A:middle
amount of overhead or maybe if

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:03.586 A:middle
one component is taking too much

00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:04.766 A:middle
energy, and you don't expect it.

00:21:05.116 --> 00:21:08.036 A:middle
And then, immediately below

00:21:08.036 --> 00:21:09.586 A:middle
that, building off of the

00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:10.876 A:middle
average component utilization

00:21:10.876 --> 00:21:12.956 A:middle
chart, we have a time series

00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:15.346 A:middle
that represents the average

00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:17.026 A:middle
utilization of each component as

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:17.936 A:middle
your app is running in real

00:21:17.936 --> 00:21:18.236 A:middle
time.

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:20.606 A:middle
We could also see here that you

00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:22.196 A:middle
have the state that your app is

00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:23.626 A:middle
actually running in, foreground

00:21:23.626 --> 00:21:25.116 A:middle
and background, and also it

00:21:25.116 --> 00:21:25.866 A:middle
would list suspended.

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:28.386 A:middle
This is a really awesome tool

00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:29.876 A:middle
for understanding how your app

00:21:29.876 --> 00:21:31.116 A:middle
is behaving in real time.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:34.996 A:middle
So, as I said, the energy gauges

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:37.236 A:middle
are really great for doing

00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:38.776 A:middle
high-level characterization work

00:21:39.586 --> 00:21:40.926 A:middle
and rapid profiling.

00:21:41.456 --> 00:21:42.186 A:middle
That's the key.

00:21:42.756 --> 00:21:43.756 A:middle
When you're iterating on your

00:21:43.756 --> 00:21:44.646 A:middle
code, you're trying to get

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:45.756 A:middle
something to work as an app

00:21:45.756 --> 00:21:46.606 A:middle
developer, and you're trying to

00:21:46.606 --> 00:21:48.496 A:middle
put something together, it may

00:21:48.496 --> 00:21:49.696 A:middle
not seem immediately clear how

00:21:49.696 --> 00:21:50.716 A:middle
you could really think about

00:21:50.716 --> 00:21:52.236 A:middle
energy, but the gauges are a

00:21:52.236 --> 00:21:53.026 A:middle
great way to start.

00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:56.406 A:middle
But let's say that you've done

00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:57.566 A:middle
that and the gauges aren't

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.316 A:middle
really enough for you.

00:21:58.816 --> 00:22:00.586 A:middle
That's where the instruments
