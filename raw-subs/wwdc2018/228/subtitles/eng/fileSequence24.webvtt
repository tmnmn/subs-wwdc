00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:01.156 A:middle
are really great for a couple of

00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:01.546 A:middle
things.

00:24:02.186 --> 00:24:03.526 A:middle
The first thing is that the

00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.906 A:middle
instruments are really great for

00:24:04.906 --> 00:24:05.946 A:middle
root cause analysis.

00:24:06.286 --> 00:24:07.326 A:middle
Let's say you have a problem in

00:24:07.326 --> 00:24:08.766 A:middle
a specific subsystem, so just

00:24:08.766 --> 00:24:09.886 A:middle
processing or networking.

00:24:10.756 --> 00:24:12.326 A:middle
You would be able to identify

00:24:12.446 --> 00:24:14.296 A:middle
pretty rapidly what that problem

00:24:14.296 --> 00:24:16.066 A:middle
might be using the Time Profiler

00:24:16.506 --> 00:24:17.466 A:middle
or the Network Profiler.

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:19.626 A:middle
The instruments are also really

00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:21.586 A:middle
great for doing in-depth

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:22.836 A:middle
profiling of your application.

00:24:23.786 --> 00:24:25.586 A:middle
If you implement a CPU

00:24:25.586 --> 00:24:27.396 A:middle
efficiency improvement of some

00:24:27.396 --> 00:24:28.756 A:middle
kind; let's say you cut down the

00:24:28.756 --> 00:24:29.566 A:middle
time that it takes for an

00:24:29.566 --> 00:24:31.166 A:middle
algorithm to execute, the

00:24:31.616 --> 00:24:32.706 A:middle
instruments are a really good

00:24:32.706 --> 00:24:34.566 A:middle
way to understand if that's the,

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:36.336 A:middle
if the intended effect of your

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:38.196 A:middle
optimization is going through on

00:24:38.196 --> 00:24:38.916 A:middle
that subsystem.

00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.596 A:middle
But there's also one more thing

00:24:41.596 --> 00:24:42.466 A:middle
that the instruments are really

00:24:42.466 --> 00:24:44.056 A:middle
awesome for that I haven't

00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:46.046 A:middle
talked about today, and that's

00:24:46.096 --> 00:24:47.206 A:middle
untethered profiling.

00:24:48.406 --> 00:24:49.846 A:middle
There's a single instrument that

00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:51.126 A:middle
you can use called the Energy

00:24:51.126 --> 00:24:52.876 A:middle
Log, which allows you to do an

00:24:52.946 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
untethered profiling run on a

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.476 A:middle
provision device while using

00:24:57.476 --> 00:24:58.106 A:middle
your application.

00:24:58.616 --> 00:24:59.846 A:middle
It's accessible directly to the

00:24:59.846 --> 00:25:02.176 A:middle
developer settings, and when you
