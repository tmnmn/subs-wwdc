00:35:00.476 --> 00:35:02.296 A:middle
This can be natural, depending

00:35:02.296 --> 00:35:03.326 A:middle
on what your app is doing.

00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:05.646 A:middle
Well, let's say it's putting a

00:35:05.646 --> 00:35:07.846 A:middle
really heavy load on the CPU for

00:35:07.846 --> 00:35:08.496 A:middle
a long time.

00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:14.046 A:middle
This causes a high CPU energy

00:35:14.046 --> 00:35:15.136 A:middle
event to be detected.

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:18.236 A:middle
Now, there are two key

00:35:18.236 --> 00:35:20.616 A:middle
thresholds that are checked for

00:35:21.246 --> 00:35:22.546 A:middle
for a high CPU energy event.

00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:24.836 A:middle
The first threshold is when your

00:35:24.836 --> 00:35:27.216 A:middle
app is spinning 80% CPU for more

00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:28.966 A:middle
than three minutes while in the

00:35:29.016 --> 00:35:30.806 A:middle
foreground, and the second

00:35:30.806 --> 00:35:33.636 A:middle
threshold is more than 80% CPU

00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:35.446 A:middle
for more than one minute while

00:35:35.446 --> 00:35:36.086 A:middle
in the background.

00:35:37.056 --> 00:35:38.696 A:middle
In this latter case, your app

00:35:38.696 --> 00:35:40.346 A:middle
may actually get killed to

00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:41.576 A:middle
prevent runaway background

00:35:41.576 --> 00:35:42.046 A:middle
usage.

00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:47.486 A:middle
Each instance of a CPU Energy

00:35:47.486 --> 00:35:49.496 A:middle
Log indicates that your app uses

00:35:49.496 --> 00:35:51.086 A:middle
so much CPU that it was worth

00:35:51.086 --> 00:35:51.566 A:middle
flagging.

00:35:52.726 --> 00:35:53.816 A:middle
What this means in practical

00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:56.276 A:middle
terms is that it was responsible

00:35:56.276 --> 00:35:59.536 A:middle
for up to a 1% battery drop in a

00:35:59.536 --> 00:36:01.636 A:middle
typical case.
