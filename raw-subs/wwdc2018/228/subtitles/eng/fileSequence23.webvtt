00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.276 A:middle
very quickly drag and drop other

00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:03.296 A:middle
instruments into you profiling

00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:05.046 A:middle
pane, which can be found here.

00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:07.386 A:middle
And now, this profiling pane

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.586 A:middle
actually allows you to see what

00:23:08.586 --> 00:23:09.586 A:middle
instruments are running and

00:23:09.586 --> 00:23:10.516 A:middle
currently profiling your

00:23:10.516 --> 00:23:11.046 A:middle
application.

00:23:12.026 --> 00:23:13.176 A:middle
Here, since we're using a Time

00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:15.316 A:middle
Profiler, we see the CPU usage

00:23:15.626 --> 00:23:17.076 A:middle
and a graphical representation

00:23:17.106 --> 00:23:18.406 A:middle
of how much CPU usage is being

00:23:18.406 --> 00:23:19.506 A:middle
consumed over time.

00:23:21.396 --> 00:23:22.726 A:middle
Directly below that, we have a

00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:23.756 A:middle
weighted call graph.

00:23:24.246 --> 00:23:25.036 A:middle
Since we're using the Time

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:25.986 A:middle
Profiler, we're trying to

00:23:25.986 --> 00:23:28.056 A:middle
understand how our CPU is being

00:23:28.056 --> 00:23:28.916 A:middle
used by the application.

00:23:30.026 --> 00:23:31.526 A:middle
To that end, there's a weighted

00:23:31.526 --> 00:23:32.506 A:middle
call graph that allows you to

00:23:32.506 --> 00:23:34.436 A:middle
see exactly what is being called

00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:35.806 A:middle
in your application and how much

00:23:35.806 --> 00:23:37.966 A:middle
weight it has on CPU time.

00:23:38.456 --> 00:23:40.876 A:middle
And then, directly to the right

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:42.156 A:middle
of that, you have a summation of

00:23:42.156 --> 00:23:43.356 A:middle
the heaviest stacked race in

00:23:43.356 --> 00:23:45.416 A:middle
your application that basically

00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:47.616 A:middle
says what is the heaviest stack

00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.606 A:middle
during this profiling run?

00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:52.086 A:middle
There are a lot of other great

00:23:52.086 --> 00:23:53.246 A:middle
instruments that you can use,

00:23:54.636 --> 00:23:58.156 A:middle
and here are some of them now.

00:23:58.156 --> 00:23:59.196 A:middle
This means that the instruments

00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:01.156 A:middle
are really great for a couple of
