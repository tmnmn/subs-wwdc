00:09:59.146 --> 00:10:00.646 A:middle
interaction or some kind of a

00:10:00.646 --> 00:10:01.916 A:middle
notification from our server

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:03.796 A:middle
will provide us the new content

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:05.586 A:middle
and display it to the user.

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.646 A:middle
This solution isn't that

00:10:08.646 --> 00:10:09.426 A:middle
different, but it's an

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:11.136 A:middle
energy-efficient approach and

00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:12.906 A:middle
makes a dramatic impact on our

00:10:12.906 --> 00:10:13.726 A:middle
power over time.

00:10:14.426 --> 00:10:15.286 A:middle
Let's take a look at why.

00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:17.936 A:middle
Now, if we imaging that our app

00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:18.996 A:middle
is running in the foreground,

00:10:18.996 --> 00:10:20.296 A:middle
and a user interaction occurs,

00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:22.056 A:middle
we would refresh our content

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:23.756 A:middle
feed and display it to the user.

00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:26.636 A:middle
Then, our app will go idle as

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:27.986 A:middle
our user is using it, let's say,

00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:29.996 A:middle
to scroll or just to read the

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.116 A:middle
content that's been displayed.

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:33.206 A:middle
You'll notice that the overhead

00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:34.516 A:middle
here is still a little bit high,

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:35.706 A:middle
but it's been significantly

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:36.176 A:middle
reduced.

00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:38.086 A:middle
The trick here is that we've

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:39.606 A:middle
allowed the subsystems we no

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.846 A:middle
longer need to go to sleep and

00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.026 A:middle
idle off.

00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:47.166 A:middle
Another tenet that we can follow

00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:49.046 A:middle
to reduce our energy consumption

00:10:49.046 --> 00:10:51.306 A:middle
in the foreground is to minimize

00:10:51.306 --> 00:10:52.196 A:middle
complex UI.

00:10:53.376 --> 00:10:54.516 A:middle
So, I mentioned before that in

00:10:54.516 --> 00:10:56.696 A:middle
graphics our energy consumption

00:10:56.696 --> 00:10:58.676 A:middle
is highly complexity-dependent,

00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:00.726 A:middle
and we always want to make our
