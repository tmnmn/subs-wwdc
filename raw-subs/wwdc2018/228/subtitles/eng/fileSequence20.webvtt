00:20:00.006 --> 00:20:01.126 A:middle
As you can see, we've selected

00:20:01.126 --> 00:20:02.566 A:middle
the row that says energy impact,

00:20:02.566 --> 00:20:04.446 A:middle
and now we have this main area

00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:05.586 A:middle
in the UI that's composed of

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:06.716 A:middle
three major sections.

00:20:07.736 --> 00:20:08.896 A:middle
On the top left, we have the

00:20:08.896 --> 00:20:10.436 A:middle
canonical gauges themselves.

00:20:11.456 --> 00:20:13.706 A:middle
These gauges range from low,

00:20:14.006 --> 00:20:15.706 A:middle
high, and very high, and

00:20:15.706 --> 00:20:17.096 A:middle
represent the average energy

00:20:17.096 --> 00:20:18.756 A:middle
impact of your app at an

00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:19.766 A:middle
instantaneous moment.

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.256 A:middle
It's important to know that

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:23.846 A:middle
where the gauge actually falls

00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:25.356 A:middle
doesn't necessarily mean good or

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:25.716 A:middle
bad.

00:20:26.236 --> 00:20:27.446 A:middle
It means that whatever your app

00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:29.366 A:middle
is doing, it's consuming this

00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:30.756 A:middle
much relative amount of energy.

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:33.866 A:middle
It's important because it's up

00:20:33.866 --> 00:20:35.076 A:middle
to you as an app developer to

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:36.306 A:middle
think about your use case and

00:20:36.306 --> 00:20:37.346 A:middle
whether or not you would expect

00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:38.466 A:middle
it to do that.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:41.306 A:middle
To the right of that, we have

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:42.206 A:middle
the average component

00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:44.156 A:middle
utilization, and this is going

00:20:44.156 --> 00:20:45.846 A:middle
to be a pie chart that shows you

00:20:46.216 --> 00:20:47.576 A:middle
all of the different components

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.616 A:middle
relative to the total amount of

00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:50.646 A:middle
energy that you're consuming,

00:20:51.076 --> 00:20:52.316 A:middle
what percentage those components

00:20:52.316 --> 00:20:52.816 A:middle
are consuming.

00:20:54.016 --> 00:20:55.316 A:middle
This is really useful because

00:20:55.316 --> 00:20:56.456 A:middle
it's representative of those

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:57.436 A:middle
subsystems we talked about

00:20:57.436 --> 00:20:58.646 A:middle
earlier, and it helps to

00:20:58.646 --> 00:21:00.896 A:middle
identify if you have an excess
