00:32:05.366 --> 00:32:06.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:32:06.906 --> 00:32:08.846 A:middle
Hi, I'm David, and I'm here

00:32:08.846 --> 00:32:10.736 A:middle
today to talk about some new

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:12.486 A:middle
great tools for energy

00:32:12.486 --> 00:32:12.876 A:middle
debugging.

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:18.056 A:middle
If you're an iOS developer with

00:32:18.056 --> 00:32:19.786 A:middle
an app in the App Store, or in

00:32:19.786 --> 00:32:21.216 A:middle
TestFlight, then this part of

00:32:21.216 --> 00:32:22.356 A:middle
the talk is for you.

00:32:23.506 --> 00:32:24.596 A:middle
I'd like to start with the

00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:26.836 A:middle
following question, now that

00:32:26.836 --> 00:32:28.436 A:middle
you've shipped your app, how do

00:32:28.436 --> 00:32:29.866 A:middle
you know how our app is doing in

00:32:29.866 --> 00:32:30.306 A:middle
the wild?

00:32:31.356 --> 00:32:33.676 A:middle
In other words, how do you know

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:35.206 A:middle
if your customers are

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:37.246 A:middle
experiencing energy issues that

00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:38.936 A:middle
are leading to bad battery life?

00:32:38.936 --> 00:32:41.636 A:middle
Now, a customer may leave a

00:32:41.636 --> 00:32:43.176 A:middle
review on the App Store, saying,

00:32:43.716 --> 00:32:45.886 A:middle
"My battery went down a lot

00:32:45.886 --> 00:32:46.976 A:middle
while using this app."

00:32:48.246 --> 00:32:49.396 A:middle
But they might not be able to

00:32:49.396 --> 00:32:50.786 A:middle
tell you what happened.

00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:53.576 A:middle
Or even worse, they may delete

00:32:53.576 --> 00:32:54.906 A:middle
your app and not leave any

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:55.646 A:middle
feedback at all.

00:32:56.816 --> 00:32:58.316 A:middle
So, it can be challenging to

00:32:58.316 --> 00:33:00.166 A:middle
find out if you have energy
