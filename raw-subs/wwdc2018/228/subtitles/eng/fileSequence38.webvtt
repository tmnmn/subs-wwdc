00:37:59.606 --> 00:38:01.986 A:middle
1 and Method 2 were active.

00:38:03.796 --> 00:38:05.726 A:middle
The second backtrace shows that

00:38:05.726 --> 00:38:09.236 A:middle
main Method 3 and Method 4 were

00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:11.756 A:middle
active and so on.

00:38:17.566 --> 00:38:19.186 A:middle
Now, we can try to combine these

00:38:19.226 --> 00:38:21.196 A:middle
backtraces together to form an

00:38:21.196 --> 00:38:22.216 A:middle
overall picture.

00:38:23.026 --> 00:38:24.746 A:middle
What we see here is a weight

00:38:24.746 --> 00:38:26.946 A:middle
call graph, and this weighted

00:38:27.036 --> 00:38:28.396 A:middle
call graph is really useful.

00:38:29.426 --> 00:38:31.036 A:middle
Here, we can see that main was

00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:32.496 A:middle
present in six out of the six

00:38:32.496 --> 00:38:33.826 A:middle
samples that we collected,

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.426 A:middle
meaning that main was running

00:38:36.426 --> 00:38:38.816 A:middle
100% of the time.

00:38:39.026 --> 00:38:40.976 A:middle
Of that, we see that Method 1

00:38:41.136 --> 00:38:43.936 A:middle
had five samples whereas Method

00:38:43.996 --> 00:38:45.556 A:middle
3 had only one sample.

00:38:45.986 --> 00:38:48.986 A:middle
And within Method 1, we see that

00:38:48.986 --> 00:38:51.426 A:middle
Method 2 and Method 3 had three

00:38:51.656 --> 00:38:52.696 A:middle
samples and one sample

00:38:52.696 --> 00:38:53.376 A:middle
respectively.

00:38:54.566 --> 00:38:56.016 A:middle
So, this gives us an overall

00:38:56.016 --> 00:38:58.416 A:middle
picture of where the code was

00:38:58.446 --> 00:39:00.346 A:middle
being executed and how much time
