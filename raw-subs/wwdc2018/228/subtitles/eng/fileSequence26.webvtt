00:25:59.676 --> 00:26:01.136 A:middle
build Energy Game here through

00:26:01.136 --> 00:26:03.406 A:middle
the Xcode UI and let it run.

00:26:04.136 --> 00:26:05.976 A:middle
Then, you'll see on the right

00:26:05.976 --> 00:26:07.956 A:middle
side that all it really does is

00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:08.736 A:middle
draw a little little battery

00:26:08.736 --> 00:26:10.126 A:middle
sprite at a random time.

00:26:10.746 --> 00:26:11.226 A:middle
There it is.

00:26:11.706 --> 00:26:12.246 A:middle
Very simple.

00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:15.266 A:middle
If I jump straight into the

00:26:15.266 --> 00:26:16.716 A:middle
Xcode debugger and jump to

00:26:16.716 --> 00:26:18.756 A:middle
energy impact, now, I can see my

00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:19.286 A:middle
gauges.

00:26:19.796 --> 00:26:22.226 A:middle
And so this is the UI that we

00:26:22.226 --> 00:26:22.976 A:middle
just talked about.

00:26:23.366 --> 00:26:25.336 A:middle
It's the same three areas that

00:26:25.336 --> 00:26:26.946 A:middle
we discussed, and you could see

00:26:26.946 --> 00:26:28.556 A:middle
right now that all my app is

00:26:28.556 --> 00:26:30.086 A:middle
doing that we've designed it to

00:26:30.086 --> 00:26:32.656 A:middle
do is just placed some sprites

00:26:32.656 --> 00:26:33.126 A:middle
onscreen.

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:35.056 A:middle
But you notice that I'm doing

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:36.346 A:middle
networking, and my overhead

00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:38.486 A:middle
seems to be high for simply no

00:26:38.486 --> 00:26:38.836 A:middle
reason.

00:26:39.526 --> 00:26:40.806 A:middle
Well, this is because we're also

00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
doing a little bit of networking

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:43.886 A:middle
and uploading the spike count

00:26:44.056 --> 00:26:45.376 A:middle
every time a new spike is drawn

00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:45.846 A:middle
onscreen.

00:26:46.766 --> 00:26:48.036 A:middle
And so, through the Xcode energy

00:26:48.036 --> 00:26:49.406 A:middle
gauges, you can actually see the

00:26:49.406 --> 00:26:50.866 A:middle
impact of doing that.

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:53.796 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:55.666 A:middle
stop this now and jump into my

00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:57.346 A:middle
code to understand where this is

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:57.796 A:middle
coming from.

00:26:58.296 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
So, if I go to my View
