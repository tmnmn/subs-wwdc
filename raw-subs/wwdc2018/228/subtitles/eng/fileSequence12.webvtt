00:11:58.556 --> 00:12:01.236 A:middle
So, a good approach to take

00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:02.586 A:middle
advantage of this optimization

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:03.966 A:middle
and counteract this sort of

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:06.066 A:middle
energy inefficiency we see is to

00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:09.596 A:middle
have a simple auto dismissal of

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:10.556 A:middle
our UI controls.

00:12:11.076 --> 00:12:13.676 A:middle
And this could mean that any

00:12:13.676 --> 00:12:15.526 A:middle
related content that we put on

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.296 A:middle
the video or in the UI layer

00:12:17.496 --> 00:12:18.786 A:middle
simply goes away if the user is

00:12:18.786 --> 00:12:19.606 A:middle
not interacting with it.

00:12:20.776 --> 00:12:22.526 A:middle
This makes a big difference on

00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:23.546 A:middle
our energy consumption during

00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:25.466 A:middle
video playback, as this display

00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:27.006 A:middle
optimization is critical for

00:12:27.006 --> 00:12:28.166 A:middle
maintaining quiescent

00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:30.076 A:middle
energy-efficient playback.

00:12:30.076 --> 00:12:34.586 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about the

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:36.116 A:middle
foreground, but what about the

00:12:36.116 --> 00:12:36.646 A:middle
background?

00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:38.316 A:middle
Many of us who are building

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:39.396 A:middle
applications such as music

00:12:39.396 --> 00:12:40.996 A:middle
players, or maybe even alarm

00:12:40.996 --> 00:12:42.176 A:middle
clocks, are focused on the

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:42.706 A:middle
background.

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.746 A:middle
Our main experience comes from

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:46.316 A:middle
our app running effectively in

00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:46.776 A:middle
the background.

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:49.866 A:middle
Well, when we're in the

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.116 A:middle
background, we have some things

00:12:51.116 --> 00:12:52.056 A:middle
that we need to be aware of.

00:12:53.326 --> 00:12:54.416 A:middle
Likely, our app is going to be

00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:55.646 A:middle
running in conjunction and

00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:57.196 A:middle
concurrently with other systems

00:12:57.196 --> 00:12:57.816 A:middle
on device.

00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:00.466 A:middle
Let's say I'll be using iMessage
