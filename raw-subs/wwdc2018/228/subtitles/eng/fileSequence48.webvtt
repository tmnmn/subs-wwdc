00:47:59.586 --> 00:48:02.226 A:middle
negative, and we've seen cases

00:48:02.226 --> 00:48:03.926 A:middle
of this happening, especially

00:48:03.926 --> 00:48:05.786 A:middle
when users try to game the

00:48:05.786 --> 00:48:06.296 A:middle
system.

00:48:07.116 --> 00:48:08.276 A:middle
Maybe they're playing a game,

00:48:09.556 --> 00:48:10.606 A:middle
and they want to reset the

00:48:10.606 --> 00:48:11.036 A:middle
clock.

00:48:11.816 --> 00:48:13.296 A:middle
Maybe they want some extra lives

00:48:13.296 --> 00:48:14.966 A:middle
or some extra chances, so they

00:48:14.966 --> 00:48:16.606 A:middle
go into System Settings and

00:48:16.606 --> 00:48:18.056 A:middle
change the clock to 24 hours

00:48:18.056 --> 00:48:18.346 A:middle
ago.

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:21.896 A:middle
Well, in this case, this causes

00:48:21.896 --> 00:48:23.136 A:middle
next update interval to be

00:48:23.136 --> 00:48:25.996 A:middle
negative, and when we schedule a

00:48:25.996 --> 00:48:27.816 A:middle
timer for a time that is

00:48:27.816 --> 00:48:29.936 A:middle
sometime in the past, that timer

00:48:29.936 --> 00:48:32.056 A:middle
will fire immediately and then

00:48:32.056 --> 00:48:33.836 A:middle
call itself again and again.

00:48:35.036 --> 00:48:36.476 A:middle
So, we effectively have an

00:48:36.476 --> 00:48:39.516 A:middle
infinite loop here.

00:48:39.686 --> 00:48:41.136 A:middle
Fortunately, this is really easy

00:48:41.136 --> 00:48:41.576 A:middle
to fix.

00:48:42.356 --> 00:48:44.116 A:middle
We just go into this function

00:48:44.116 --> 00:48:46.786 A:middle
here and change this to less

00:48:46.786 --> 00:48:49.026 A:middle
than or equal to 0 so that even

00:48:49.066 --> 00:48:50.496 A:middle
if next update interval is

00:48:50.496 --> 00:48:52.326 A:middle
negative, we can break out of

00:48:52.326 --> 00:48:52.686 A:middle
the loop.

00:48:53.136 --> 00:48:55.866 A:middle
Now, this is a really great

00:48:55.936 --> 00:48:58.576 A:middle
example of an energy issue that

00:48:58.576 --> 00:49:00.626 A:middle
is really difficult to catch
