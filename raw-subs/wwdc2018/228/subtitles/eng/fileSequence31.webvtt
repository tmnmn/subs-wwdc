00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:01.336 A:middle
gauges, as we said, are great

00:31:01.336 --> 00:31:02.246 A:middle
for rapid iteration.

00:31:02.956 --> 00:31:04.246 A:middle
They allow you to quickly see

00:31:04.626 --> 00:31:05.466 A:middle
where your problem might be

00:31:05.466 --> 00:31:07.376 A:middle
happening, and they allow you to

00:31:07.376 --> 00:31:08.626 A:middle
take the next step in figuring

00:31:08.626 --> 00:31:09.866 A:middle
out how to solve it.

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:13.906 A:middle
The second takeaway is that the

00:31:13.906 --> 00:31:15.616 A:middle
instruments are great for

00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:16.476 A:middle
in-depth profiling.

00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:20.386 A:middle
And finally, the third takeaway

00:31:20.446 --> 00:31:21.396 A:middle
is that we want you to think

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:23.286 A:middle
about energy efficiency as a

00:31:23.286 --> 00:31:24.536 A:middle
primary objective in your

00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:25.406 A:middle
application development.

00:31:26.186 --> 00:31:27.476 A:middle
We have powerful tools available

00:31:27.476 --> 00:31:28.796 A:middle
for you to quickly understand

00:31:29.136 --> 00:31:30.346 A:middle
where your energy is going and

00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:31.836 A:middle
to root cause problems that

00:31:31.836 --> 00:31:32.796 A:middle
might be energy related.

00:31:33.296 --> 00:31:35.466 A:middle
So, let's say you've done all of

00:31:35.466 --> 00:31:36.426 A:middle
that, and you've shipped your

00:31:36.426 --> 00:31:36.976 A:middle
application.

00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:39.086 A:middle
From the App Store it's getting

00:31:39.086 --> 00:31:40.546 A:middle
used; all your customers are

00:31:40.546 --> 00:31:42.436 A:middle
greatly thankful that you

00:31:42.436 --> 00:31:43.066 A:middle
shipped it on time.

00:31:43.516 --> 00:31:44.166 A:middle
What's next?

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:46.086 A:middle
Let's say you still see

00:31:46.116 --> 00:31:47.306 A:middle
customers saying that your app

00:31:47.306 --> 00:31:48.336 A:middle
is bad for battery life.

00:31:48.986 --> 00:31:50.036 A:middle
What sort of recourse do you

00:31:50.036 --> 00:31:50.286 A:middle
have?

00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:53.096 A:middle
Well, now, I'm going to pass it

00:31:53.096 --> 00:31:54.236 A:middle
on to my colleague, David, who's

00:31:54.596 --> 00:31:56.126 A:middle
going to talk to you about how

00:31:56.126 --> 00:31:57.486 A:middle
you can face those challenges

00:31:57.486 --> 00:31:58.946 A:middle
and solve them using our new

00:31:58.946 --> 00:31:59.446 A:middle
tools.

00:31:59.586 --> 00:31:59.896 A:middle
David.
