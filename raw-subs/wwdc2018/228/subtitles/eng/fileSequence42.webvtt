00:41:59.486 --> 00:42:01.276 A:middle
right-hand side are some

00:42:01.276 --> 00:42:03.006 A:middle
statistics about the energy

00:42:03.006 --> 00:42:03.386 A:middle
issue.

00:42:04.796 --> 00:42:06.506 A:middle
So, let's go ahead into the left

00:42:06.506 --> 00:42:09.136 A:middle
here and select Energy Game,

00:42:09.346 --> 00:42:10.176 A:middle
which is the game that we're

00:42:10.176 --> 00:42:10.736 A:middle
working on.

00:42:11.236 --> 00:42:13.616 A:middle
And then, make sure that we're

00:42:13.616 --> 00:42:14.000 A:middle
on the correct build.

00:42:19.756 --> 00:42:21.736 A:middle
We see here a list of our top

00:42:21.736 --> 00:42:23.846 A:middle
energy issues, sorted by how

00:42:23.846 --> 00:42:25.036 A:middle
many times it's affected.

00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:28.496 A:middle
Let's jump into this first

00:42:28.496 --> 00:42:31.996 A:middle
energy issue, which hit 64 of

00:42:31.996 --> 00:42:32.686 A:middle
our devices.

00:42:36.656 --> 00:42:38.426 A:middle
On the right-hand pane here, we

00:42:38.426 --> 00:42:39.786 A:middle
have some more details about

00:42:39.786 --> 00:42:42.076 A:middle
what happened, as well as a

00:42:42.076 --> 00:42:43.946 A:middle
breakdown of how often that

00:42:43.946 --> 00:42:45.616 A:middle
energy issue happened, and we

00:42:45.616 --> 00:42:47.236 A:middle
can see that it happened across

00:42:47.236 --> 00:42:49.806 A:middle
a mix of iPads, iPods, and iPod

00:42:49.806 --> 00:42:51.946 A:middle
Touches, and we can see a

00:42:51.946 --> 00:42:53.626 A:middle
distribution of how often it

00:42:53.626 --> 00:42:55.196 A:middle
happened in the past two weeks.

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.576 A:middle
Let's take a look at the

00:42:57.576 --> 00:42:58.476 A:middle
weighted call graph.

00:42:58.966 --> 00:43:03.406 A:middle
We see that a lot of time is
