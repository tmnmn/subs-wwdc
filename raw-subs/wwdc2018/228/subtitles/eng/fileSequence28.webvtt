00:27:58.596 --> 00:28:01.156 A:middle
So, now, I'm going to go ahead

00:28:01.156 --> 00:28:02.636 A:middle
and inject a bug and try to see

00:28:02.636 --> 00:28:04.826 A:middle
how we can see a bug when we use

00:28:04.826 --> 00:28:06.076 A:middle
Xcode energy gauges.

00:28:06.806 --> 00:28:08.796 A:middle
Bug1 is a simple bug that you

00:28:08.796 --> 00:28:09.976 A:middle
can see on the bottom left here

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:11.506 A:middle
that will essentially cause a

00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:12.866 A:middle
CPU spin in the background.

00:28:13.276 --> 00:28:14.406 A:middle
This is a case that many of us

00:28:14.406 --> 00:28:15.906 A:middle
might face in regular and real

00:28:15.906 --> 00:28:16.616 A:middle
world development.

00:28:17.246 --> 00:28:18.596 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and inject

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:19.066 A:middle
this bug.

00:28:19.066 --> 00:28:21.966 A:middle
And now that I've injected it,

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.186 A:middle
I'm going to background Energy

00:28:23.186 --> 00:28:25.216 A:middle
Game, and as you can see in the

00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:26.886 A:middle
Energy Gauge's UI, we transfer

00:28:26.886 --> 00:28:27.456 A:middle
to the background.

00:28:28.536 --> 00:28:29.686 A:middle
We do a little bit of networking

00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:30.876 A:middle
because I moved that networking

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:31.836 A:middle
call to the background.

00:28:32.686 --> 00:28:33.866 A:middle
But now, we also see that our

00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:35.396 A:middle
CPU is going wild.

00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:38.356 A:middle
So, this is the power of the

00:28:38.356 --> 00:28:38.926 A:middle
gauges.

00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:40.136 A:middle
We've now, we know that we're

00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:41.366 A:middle
injecting a bug, but we can see

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:42.836 A:middle
that bug directly in the gauges.

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:45.106 A:middle
So, now, to find the root cause,

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:46.326 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and jump

00:28:46.326 --> 00:28:47.386 A:middle
into the Time Profiler and

00:28:47.386 --> 00:28:48.586 A:middle
transfer my debug session, as we

00:28:48.616 --> 00:28:49.000 A:middle
discussed before.

00:28:53.656 --> 00:28:55.256 A:middle
So, now, I transferred my debug

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:56.266 A:middle
session, and it will begin

00:28:56.266 --> 00:28:57.196 A:middle
running automatically.

00:28:57.706 --> 00:29:00.976 A:middle
And as you see, the weighted
