00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:00.726 A:middle
and we always want to make our

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:01.926 A:middle
apps look as good as possible.

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:03.226 A:middle
So, we're going to spend a lot

00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:04.726 A:middle
of time building this UI that

00:11:04.726 --> 00:11:06.436 A:middle
looks great and animations that

00:11:06.436 --> 00:11:07.406 A:middle
are pleasing to view.

00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:09.406 A:middle
However, this can have

00:11:09.406 --> 00:11:11.556 A:middle
unintended side effects, and

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:12.946 A:middle
let's look at an example to

00:11:12.946 --> 00:11:13.666 A:middle
illustrate why.

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:17.636 A:middle
If I'm a video player, my goal

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.156 A:middle
is to let a user watch a video.

00:11:20.056 --> 00:11:20.416 A:middle
Simple.

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:22.696 A:middle
But I could be tempted to add

00:11:22.696 --> 00:11:24.786 A:middle
new controls and UI above that

00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:26.446 A:middle
video, let's say, in the form of

00:11:26.516 --> 00:11:28.716 A:middle
related videos or a scrubber or

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:29.856 A:middle
maybe volume controls.

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:32.076 A:middle
This allows a greater degree of

00:11:32.076 --> 00:11:34.276 A:middle
control to the user to use this

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.666 A:middle
application and enjoy the video

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:36.756 A:middle
they're watching.

00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:39.256 A:middle
This is actually insidiously

00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:41.606 A:middle
energy inefficient, and let's

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:42.406 A:middle
understand why.

00:11:43.506 --> 00:11:45.276 A:middle
On many of our devices, there's

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:46.836 A:middle
a display optimization in place

00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:48.496 A:middle
that allows for video playback

00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:50.076 A:middle
to be very energy efficient when

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.456 A:middle
there is no UI on screen.

00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:53.426 A:middle
This is something that is not

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:54.526 A:middle
immediately clear when you're

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:55.556 A:middle
building an application like

00:11:55.556 --> 00:11:55.896 A:middle
this.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.516 A:middle
However, it makes all the

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:58.116 A:middle
difference.

00:11:58.556 --> 00:12:01.236 A:middle
So, a good approach to take
