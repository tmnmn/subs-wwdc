00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular,

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.126 A:middle
it's going to consume energy in

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:04.286 A:middle
the location system.

00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:07.356 A:middle
The location energy is going to

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:08.776 A:middle
be accuracy and frequency

00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:09.166 A:middle
dependent.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:11.376 A:middle
If you're asking to fix a user's

00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:12.526 A:middle
location with a high degree of

00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:14.366 A:middle
accuracy and at a very high

00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:16.276 A:middle
cadence, you're going to get a

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:17.686 A:middle
lot of energy consumed in the

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:18.416 A:middle
form of location.

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:21.736 A:middle
So, putting it all together, the

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:23.056 A:middle
more time spent tracking

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:24.436 A:middle
location in your application,

00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:25.916 A:middle
the more energy you'll consume

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:27.176 A:middle
as location energy.

00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:32.306 A:middle
Finally, we have graphics.

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:35.656 A:middle
In the graphics subsystem, you

00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:36.806 A:middle
would imagine that process

00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:38.506 A:middle
components such as he GPU and

00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:40.146 A:middle
the CPU contribute to the energy

00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:41.626 A:middle
consumed by graphics.

00:06:42.786 --> 00:06:44.016 A:middle
This is going to be animations

00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:44.956 A:middle
and UI dependent.

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:47.206 A:middle
So, when your app is asking for

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.926 A:middle
any animations to be displayed

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:50.496 A:middle
or any UI to be rendered, it's

00:06:50.496 --> 00:06:51.576 A:middle
going to consume energy in the

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:52.626 A:middle
form of graphics.

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.556 A:middle
This is highly complexity

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:55.956 A:middle
dependent.

00:06:56.846 --> 00:06:58.446 A:middle
The more complex your animations

00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:00.186 A:middle
and UI are the more energy that
