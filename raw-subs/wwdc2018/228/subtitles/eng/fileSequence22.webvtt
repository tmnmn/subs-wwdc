00:21:58.816 --> 00:22:00.586 A:middle
That's where the instruments

00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:02.726 A:middle
come in, and directly through

00:22:02.726 --> 00:22:04.396 A:middle
the energy gauge's UI, we have

00:22:04.396 --> 00:22:06.246 A:middle
access to three instruments that

00:22:06.246 --> 00:22:07.966 A:middle
we think best correlate to the

00:22:07.966 --> 00:22:08.996 A:middle
subsystems we talked about

00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:09.366 A:middle
before.

00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:13.066 A:middle
These include the time profile,

00:22:13.586 --> 00:22:15.096 A:middle
the network profiler, and the

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:17.516 A:middle
location profiler, and if you

00:22:17.516 --> 00:22:18.916 A:middle
were to click through into any

00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:20.576 A:middle
of these from the energy gauge's

00:22:20.796 --> 00:22:21.416 A:middle
UI, you would be able to

00:22:21.416 --> 00:22:22.596 A:middle
transfer your current debug

00:22:22.596 --> 00:22:24.006 A:middle
session into any of those

00:22:24.006 --> 00:22:24.586 A:middle
instruments.

00:22:25.016 --> 00:22:27.616 A:middle
Let's take a look at one of the

00:22:27.616 --> 00:22:29.136 A:middle
instruments here, the Time

00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:30.956 A:middle
Profiler, and try to understand

00:22:31.696 --> 00:22:33.386 A:middle
the UI.

00:22:33.576 --> 00:22:34.936 A:middle
Now, the instruments have a very

00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:37.176 A:middle
standard UI, but what's

00:22:37.176 --> 00:22:38.536 A:middle
interesting about it is that

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:39.566 A:middle
it's very useable.

00:22:40.196 --> 00:22:40.986 A:middle
And let's take a look.

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.656 A:middle
Here, we can see the Time

00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:46.116 A:middle
Profiler UI, and on the top, you

00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:48.076 A:middle
see a bar that's representative

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:48.996 A:middle
of the different controls that

00:22:48.996 --> 00:22:50.366 A:middle
you have of the actual

00:22:50.366 --> 00:22:50.916 A:middle
instruments.

00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:52.596 A:middle
On the top left, ou can see you

00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:53.886 A:middle
have a Play and Pause button as

00:22:53.886 --> 00:22:55.066 A:middle
well as your target that you're

00:22:55.066 --> 00:22:56.116 A:middle
using to profile.

00:22:56.116 --> 00:22:58.136 A:middle
And then, on the right, you see

00:22:58.136 --> 00:22:59.656 A:middle
a plus button that allows you to

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.276 A:middle
very quickly drag and drop other
