00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.426 A:middle
Apps are also hugely important

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:03.186 A:middle
to our customers.

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:05.906 A:middle
In fact, we find that most usage

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:07.916 A:middle
on device is directly attributed

00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:09.126 A:middle
to third-party apps.

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:11.216 A:middle
This is incredible, and it makes

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.446 A:middle
it more important now than ever

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:15.556 A:middle
before to focus on energy

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:17.156 A:middle
efficiency in the design of your

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:17.716 A:middle
application.

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:20.356 A:middle
To that end, we're going to talk

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:21.416 A:middle
about three things today.

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.516 A:middle
First, we're going to talk about

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:25.796 A:middle
some battery life concepts that

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:27.136 A:middle
you can employ in your

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:28.956 A:middle
application to make sure that

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:29.906 A:middle
you are being as energy

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:30.806 A:middle
efficient as possible.

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:33.326 A:middle
Then, we're going to talk about

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.506 A:middle
some tools that we have

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:36.926 A:middle
available for you to understand

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:38.396 A:middle
and quantify where energy is

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:39.526 A:middle
going in your application.

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:41.906 A:middle
And finally, I'll pass it on to

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:42.996 A:middle
my colleague, David, who is

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:44.266 A:middle
going to talk about a new tool

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.706 A:middle
that we have available to take

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.176 A:middle
your energy debugging one step

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:47.536 A:middle
further.

00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:49.846 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and get

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:51.186 A:middle
started and talk about some

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:52.106 A:middle
general concepts.

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.446 A:middle
To make a battery life great for

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.096 A:middle
our users, we have to start with

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.136 A:middle
first principles and understand

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.026 A:middle
what makes battery life battery
