00:24:02.606 --> 00:24:03.796 A:middle
Now, Metal is designed to take

00:24:03.796 --> 00:24:05.036 A:middle
advantage of the TBDR

00:24:05.036 --> 00:24:06.636 A:middle
architecture automatically

00:24:06.636 --> 00:24:08.796 A:middle
within each render pass, load

00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:10.636 A:middle
and store actions, make explicit

00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:11.936 A:middle
how render pass attachments move

00:24:11.996 --> 00:24:13.226 A:middle
in and out of tile memory.

00:24:16.386 --> 00:24:18.266 A:middle
But the A11 GPU takes the TBDR

00:24:18.266 --> 00:24:19.706 A:middle
architecture even further.

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:21.656 A:middle
We added new capabilities to our

00:24:21.656 --> 00:24:23.046 A:middle
tile memory and added an

00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:24.656 A:middle
entirely new programmable stage.

00:24:25.556 --> 00:24:27.456 A:middle
This opens up new optimization

00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:28.826 A:middle
opportunities critical to

00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:30.056 A:middle
advanced rendering techniques,

00:24:30.456 --> 00:24:31.706 A:middle
such as deferred shading,

00:24:32.246 --> 00:24:33.546 A:middle
order-independent transparency,

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:35.726 A:middle
tiled forward shading, and

00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:36.426 A:middle
particle rendering.

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.096 A:middle
So let's start by taking a look

00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:40.346 A:middle
at the architecture of the A11

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:40.796 A:middle
GPU.

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:44.356 A:middle
All right.

00:24:44.826 --> 00:24:46.236 A:middle
So on the left, we have a block

00:24:46.236 --> 00:24:47.846 A:middle
representation of the A11 GPU.

00:24:47.956 --> 00:24:49.246 A:middle
And on the right, we have system

00:24:49.246 --> 00:24:49.586 A:middle
memory.

00:24:51.486 --> 00:24:53.736 A:middle
Now, the A11 GPU first processes

00:24:53.736 --> 00:24:54.866 A:middle
all the geometry of a render

00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:56.596 A:middle
pass in the vertex stage.

00:24:57.096 --> 00:24:58.646 A:middle
It transforms and bends your

00:24:58.646 --> 00:25:00.136 A:middle
geometry into screen-aligned,
