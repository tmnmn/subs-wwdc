00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome.

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.496 A:middle
Last year, we introduced Metal

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:32.996 A:middle
2, which includes new ways for

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:34.426 A:middle
the GPU to drive the rendering

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:34.936 A:middle
pipeline.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.526 A:middle
This year, we're introducing

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:39.046 A:middle
even more new and exciting

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:41.046 A:middle
features to solve common game

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:42.026 A:middle
development challenges.

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:44.556 A:middle
My name is Brian Ross, and

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:45.676 A:middle
together with my colleague,

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.016 A:middle
Michael Imbrogno, we'll explore

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.416 A:middle
new ways to make your

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.606 A:middle
applications better, faster, and

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:53.266 A:middle
more efficient.

00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:57.016 A:middle
But first, I want to talk about

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:58.336 A:middle
some of the challenges that I'm

00:00:58.336 --> 00:00:59.426 A:middle
trying to help you solve.
