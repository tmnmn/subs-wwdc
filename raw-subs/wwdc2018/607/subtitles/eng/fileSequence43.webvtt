00:42:58.836 --> 00:43:00.306 A:middle
hide behind it, we need to

00:43:00.306 --> 00:43:02.666 A:middle
render it.

00:43:02.936 --> 00:43:04.906 A:middle
So want to talk a little bit

00:43:04.906 --> 00:43:05.906 A:middle
about Metal.

00:43:05.906 --> 00:43:07.306 A:middle
Metal is really important in

00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:09.946 A:middle
terms of allowing us to ship the

00:43:09.946 --> 00:43:12.086 A:middle
game as fast as we did and at

00:43:12.116 --> 00:43:13.396 A:middle
the quality that we were able to

00:43:13.396 --> 00:43:13.816 A:middle
achieve.

00:43:14.486 --> 00:43:15.876 A:middle
Draw call performance was key to

00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:17.626 A:middle
this because, again, we have a

00:43:17.626 --> 00:43:20.776 A:middle
really complicated scene and we

00:43:20.776 --> 00:43:22.066 A:middle
need the performance to render

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:23.406 A:middle
it, and Metal gave us that

00:43:23.446 --> 00:43:24.116 A:middle
performance.

00:43:24.696 --> 00:43:26.196 A:middle
Metal also gave us access to a

00:43:26.196 --> 00:43:27.386 A:middle
number of hardware features,

00:43:27.386 --> 00:43:28.636 A:middle
such as programmable blending,

00:43:28.636 --> 00:43:30.486 A:middle
that we used to get important

00:43:30.486 --> 00:43:31.566 A:middle
GPU performance back.

00:43:32.286 --> 00:43:33.546 A:middle
It also has a feature set that

00:43:33.546 --> 00:43:34.866 A:middle
allowed us to use all of the

00:43:34.866 --> 00:43:36.316 A:middle
rendering techniques we need to

00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:38.506 A:middle
bring Fortnite to iOS.

00:43:38.856 --> 00:43:40.236 A:middle
In terms of rendering features,

00:43:40.676 --> 00:43:42.056 A:middle
we use a movable directional

00:43:42.056 --> 00:43:43.446 A:middle
light for the sun with cascaded

00:43:43.446 --> 00:43:44.226 A:middle
shadow maps.

00:43:44.226 --> 00:43:45.386 A:middle
We have a movable skylight

00:43:45.386 --> 00:43:46.356 A:middle
because the sky changes

00:43:46.356 --> 00:43:47.016 A:middle
throughout the day.

00:43:47.786 --> 00:43:49.176 A:middle
We use physically-based

00:43:49.176 --> 00:43:49.936 A:middle
materials.

00:43:51.436 --> 00:43:52.936 A:middle
We render in HDR and have a

00:43:52.936 --> 00:43:54.306 A:middle
tone-mapping pass at the end.

00:43:55.476 --> 00:43:57.286 A:middle
We allow particle simulation on

00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:58.036 A:middle
the GPU.

00:43:58.076 --> 00:43:59.456 A:middle
And we also support all of our

00:43:59.456 --> 00:44:00.806 A:middle
artist-authored materials.
