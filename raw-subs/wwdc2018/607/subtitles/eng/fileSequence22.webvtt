00:21:58.386 --> 00:22:00.526 A:middle
calculation for a chunk only and

00:22:00.526 --> 00:22:02.356 A:middle
not on each individual triangle.

00:22:03.576 --> 00:22:05.496 A:middle
We then tell the GPU to only

00:22:05.496 --> 00:22:06.536 A:middle
render the chunks that are

00:22:06.536 --> 00:22:07.416 A:middle
actually visible.

00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:11.956 A:middle
And again, let's see the

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.016 A:middle
side-by-side view.

00:22:13.406 --> 00:22:14.566 A:middle
The left side is your camera

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.376 A:middle
view, and the right side is

00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:17.556 A:middle
another view of the bus.

00:22:18.466 --> 00:22:20.346 A:middle
You could see the red and

00:22:20.346 --> 00:22:21.326 A:middle
pinkish tint there.

00:22:21.326 --> 00:22:22.846 A:middle
That is what our compute shaders

00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:24.306 A:middle
determined is invisible.

00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:27.606 A:middle
We never actually send this work

00:22:27.606 --> 00:22:30.216 A:middle
to the GPU, so it saves us 50%

00:22:30.216 --> 00:22:31.636 A:middle
or more of the geometry

00:22:31.706 --> 00:22:32.536 A:middle
rendering cost.

00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:38.316 A:middle
Here's 1 last view showing

00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:40.046 A:middle
which, how much this technique

00:22:40.046 --> 00:22:40.666 A:middle
could save you.

00:22:41.846 --> 00:22:43.516 A:middle
So notice on the right, many of

00:22:43.516 --> 00:22:44.876 A:middle
the buses and ambulances are

00:22:44.876 --> 00:22:45.976 A:middle
actually invisible.

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.036 A:middle
This is really amazing.

00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:52.866 A:middle
I love this.

00:22:53.556 --> 00:22:55.156 A:middle
So please take a chance to

00:22:55.156 --> 00:22:56.996 A:middle
explore the code, and I hope

00:22:57.136 --> 00:22:58.776 A:middle
I'll see this technology in some

00:22:58.776 --> 00:22:59.986 A:middle
of your games in the future.
