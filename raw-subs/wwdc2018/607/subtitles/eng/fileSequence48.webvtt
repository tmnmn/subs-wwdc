00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:01.766 A:middle
variations on a per-platform

00:48:01.766 --> 00:48:02.326 A:middle
basis.

00:48:04.926 --> 00:48:05.936 A:middle
Want to talk a little bit about

00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:06.736 A:middle
frame rate targets.

00:48:07.156 --> 00:48:08.566 A:middle
So on iOS, we wanted to target

00:48:08.566 --> 00:48:10.546 A:middle
30 fps at the highest visual

00:48:10.546 --> 00:48:11.626 A:middle
fidelity possible.

00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:13.886 A:middle
However, you can't just max out

00:48:13.916 --> 00:48:14.426 A:middle
the device.

00:48:14.426 --> 00:48:15.766 A:middle
If we were maxing out the CPU

00:48:15.766 --> 00:48:17.676 A:middle
and the GPU the entire time, the

00:48:17.676 --> 00:48:19.466 A:middle
operating system would end up

00:48:19.526 --> 00:48:21.206 A:middle
downclocking us, then we'd no

00:48:21.206 --> 00:48:22.486 A:middle
longer hit our frame rates.

00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:24.756 A:middle
We also want to conserve battery

00:48:24.756 --> 00:48:25.126 A:middle
life.

00:48:25.476 --> 00:48:26.776 A:middle
If players are playing several

00:48:26.776 --> 00:48:27.786 A:middle
games in a row during their

00:48:27.786 --> 00:48:30.336 A:middle
commute, we want to support that

00:48:30.336 --> 00:48:31.806 A:middle
rather than their device dying

00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:32.676 A:middle
before they even make it to

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:32.916 A:middle
work.

00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:36.716 A:middle
So for this, what we decided to

00:48:36.716 --> 00:48:38.216 A:middle
do was to target 60 frames per

00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:39.686 A:middle
second for the environment, but

00:48:39.686 --> 00:48:41.796 A:middle
vsync at 30, which means most of

00:48:41.796 --> 00:48:42.936 A:middle
the time when you're exploring

00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:45.306 A:middle
the map in Fortnite, your phone

00:48:45.306 --> 00:48:47.146 A:middle
is idle about 50% of the time.

00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.236 A:middle
Using that time to conserve

00:48:48.236 --> 00:48:49.986 A:middle
battery life and keep cool.

00:48:52.476 --> 00:48:53.916 A:middle
To make sure that we hit those

00:48:53.916 --> 00:48:56.006 A:middle
targets, we track performance

00:48:56.006 --> 00:48:56.896 A:middle
every day.

00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:58.546 A:middle
So every day, we have an

00:48:58.546 --> 00:49:00.096 A:middle
automation pass that goes
