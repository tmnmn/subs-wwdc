00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:03.486 A:middle
And finally, market is aliasable

00:12:03.486 --> 00:12:05.046 A:middle
so that we can reuse this for

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:06.456 A:middle
other operations, saving

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:07.816 A:middle
hundreds of megabytes.

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:09.886 A:middle
So now that we've talked about

00:12:09.886 --> 00:12:11.866 A:middle
how to parallelize and optimize

00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:13.196 A:middle
performance with explicit

00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:16.126 A:middle
control, this is great, but what

00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:18.696 A:middle
if you want to put the GPU more

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:19.526 A:middle
into the driving seat?

00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:23.276 A:middle
So let's talk about GPU-driven

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:25.566 A:middle
pipelines.

00:12:25.626 --> 00:12:27.356 A:middle
Your games are moving more and

00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:29.816 A:middle
more of the decision logic onto

00:12:30.356 --> 00:12:32.556 A:middle
the GPU, especially when it

00:12:32.556 --> 00:12:34.036 A:middle
comes to processing extremely

00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:36.046 A:middle
large data sets or scene graphs

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.556 A:middle
with thousands of objects.

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:41.376 A:middle
With Metal 2, we've made another

00:12:41.496 --> 00:12:43.226 A:middle
really important step forward in

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:44.656 A:middle
our focus on GPU-driven

00:12:44.656 --> 00:12:45.236 A:middle
pipelines.

00:12:46.236 --> 00:12:47.506 A:middle
Last year, we introduced

00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:49.086 A:middle
indirect argument buffers,

00:12:49.516 --> 00:12:51.386 A:middle
allowing you to further decrease

00:12:51.386 --> 00:12:53.336 A:middle
CPU usage and move a large

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:54.646 A:middle
portion of the workload to the

00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:55.166 A:middle
GPU.

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:57.056 A:middle
This year, we're also

00:12:57.056 --> 00:12:59.346 A:middle
introducing indirect command

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:02.566 A:middle
buffers, and this will allow you
