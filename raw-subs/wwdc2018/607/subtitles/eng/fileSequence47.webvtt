00:46:59.456 --> 00:47:00.866 A:middle
For instance, an iPhone 8 is

00:47:00.866 --> 00:47:02.336 A:middle
faster than an iPhone 7 Plus,

00:47:02.336 --> 00:47:03.796 A:middle
but it has less physical memory.

00:47:04.256 --> 00:47:05.146 A:middle
This means when you're taking

00:47:05.146 --> 00:47:06.506 A:middle
into account scalability, you

00:47:06.506 --> 00:47:07.316 A:middle
need to treat memory

00:47:07.316 --> 00:47:07.936 A:middle
differently.

00:47:07.936 --> 00:47:09.786 A:middle
We ended up treating it as an

00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:11.616 A:middle
orthogonal axis of scalability

00:47:12.226 --> 00:47:14.256 A:middle
and just had 2 buckets, low

00:47:14.256 --> 00:47:15.226 A:middle
memory and high memory.

00:47:16.046 --> 00:47:17.506 A:middle
For low-memory devices, we

00:47:17.506 --> 00:47:18.926 A:middle
disabled foliage and shadows.

00:47:19.446 --> 00:47:20.956 A:middle
We also reduced some of the

00:47:20.956 --> 00:47:21.656 A:middle
memory pool.

00:47:21.656 --> 00:47:23.296 A:middle
So for instance, we limited GPU

00:47:23.296 --> 00:47:25.396 A:middle
particles to a total of 16,000

00:47:25.846 --> 00:47:27.416 A:middle
and reduced the pool use for

00:47:27.416 --> 00:47:29.246 A:middle
cosmetics and texture memory.

00:47:29.816 --> 00:47:32.926 A:middle
We still need to do quite a bit

00:47:32.926 --> 00:47:34.266 A:middle
of memory optimization in order

00:47:34.266 --> 00:47:35.346 A:middle
to get the game to fit on the

00:47:35.346 --> 00:47:35.846 A:middle
device.

00:47:36.366 --> 00:47:37.816 A:middle
The most important was level

00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:38.936 A:middle
streaming -- basically, just

00:47:38.936 --> 00:47:40.046 A:middle
making sure that nothing is in

00:47:40.046 --> 00:47:41.176 A:middle
memory that is not around the

00:47:41.176 --> 00:47:41.566 A:middle
player.

00:47:42.356 --> 00:47:44.606 A:middle
We also used ASTC texture

00:47:44.606 --> 00:47:46.116 A:middle
compression and tend to prefer

00:47:46.416 --> 00:47:48.776 A:middle
compressing for size rather than

00:47:48.836 --> 00:47:50.476 A:middle
quality in most cases.

00:47:50.846 --> 00:47:52.236 A:middle
And we also gave our artists a

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.106 A:middle
lot of tools for being able to

00:47:54.506 --> 00:47:57.426 A:middle
cook out different LODs that

00:47:57.426 --> 00:47:59.946 A:middle
aren't needed or reduce audio

00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:01.766 A:middle
variations on a per-platform
