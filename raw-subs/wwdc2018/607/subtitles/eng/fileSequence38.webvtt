00:38:03.286 --> 00:38:04.676 A:middle
So multi-sample anti-aliasing

00:38:04.676 --> 00:38:06.016 A:middle
improves image quality by

00:38:06.016 --> 00:38:08.396 A:middle
supersampling depth, stencil,

00:38:08.766 --> 00:38:10.026 A:middle
and blending, but shades only

00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:10.676 A:middle
once per pixel.

00:38:11.816 --> 00:38:13.026 A:middle
Multiple samples are later

00:38:13.026 --> 00:38:14.716 A:middle
resolved into a final image

00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:15.836 A:middle
using simple averaging.

00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:19.676 A:middle
Now, multi-sampling is efficient

00:38:19.676 --> 00:38:21.696 A:middle
on all A series GPUs because

00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:23.196 A:middle
samples are stored in tile

00:38:23.196 --> 00:38:24.546 A:middle
memory, where blending and

00:38:24.546 --> 00:38:25.946 A:middle
resolve operations have fast

00:38:25.946 --> 00:38:26.986 A:middle
access to the samples.

00:38:29.236 --> 00:38:31.436 A:middle
The A11 GPU optimizes

00:38:31.436 --> 00:38:33.356 A:middle
multi-sampling even further by

00:38:33.356 --> 00:38:34.616 A:middle
tracking the unique colors

00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:35.346 A:middle
within each pixel.

00:38:36.036 --> 00:38:37.416 A:middle
So blending operations that

00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:38.386 A:middle
previously operated on each

00:38:38.386 --> 00:38:40.206 A:middle
sample now only operate on each

00:38:40.246 --> 00:38:40.746 A:middle
color.

00:38:41.616 --> 00:38:42.636 A:middle
This could be a significant

00:38:42.636 --> 00:38:44.036 A:middle
savings because the interior of

00:38:44.036 --> 00:38:45.756 A:middle
every triangle only contains 1

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:46.386 A:middle
unique color.

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:50.246 A:middle
Now, this mapping of unique

00:38:50.276 --> 00:38:53.406 A:middle
color to samples is called color

00:38:53.406 --> 00:38:54.606 A:middle
coverage control, and it's

00:38:54.606 --> 00:38:55.576 A:middle
managed by the GPU.

00:38:56.206 --> 00:38:57.966 A:middle
But tile shaders can also read

00:38:57.966 --> 00:38:59.506 A:middle
and modify this color coverage.
