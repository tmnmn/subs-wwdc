00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.526 A:middle
these into the ICB.

00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:03.216 A:middle
There's a couple of details

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:03.936 A:middle
worth noting.

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:06.036 A:middle
You can think of an ICB as an

00:18:06.036 --> 00:18:07.196 A:middle
array of render commands.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.156 A:middle
A render command consists of a

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:10.716 A:middle
pipeline object with shaders,

00:18:11.136 --> 00:18:12.846 A:middle
any number of buffers, and a

00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:14.466 A:middle
draw call.

00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:16.366 A:middle
Next, an ICB is built for

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:18.446 A:middle
parallelism, so you could encode

00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:20.256 A:middle
concurrently and out of order.

00:18:20.756 --> 00:18:23.316 A:middle
And lastly, we kept the API very

00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:25.126 A:middle
simple, so it's just like what

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:26.356 A:middle
you might be doing today on the

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:26.836 A:middle
CPU.

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:29.886 A:middle
Another thing -- each command

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.196 A:middle
could have different properties

00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:32.306 A:middle
and even draw types.

00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:35.116 A:middle
So this is a really, really

00:18:35.116 --> 00:18:36.486 A:middle
significant step forward from

00:18:36.486 --> 00:18:37.876 A:middle
all the flavors of indirect

00:18:37.876 --> 00:18:38.996 A:middle
rendering that many of you may

00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:39.886 A:middle
have seen elsewhere.

00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.096 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at how we

00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:43.036 A:middle
can do this in your code.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.476 A:middle
So this is how easy it is to

00:18:46.476 --> 00:18:47.526 A:middle
encode a draw call.

00:18:48.436 --> 00:18:49.616 A:middle
The first thing you're going to

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:51.096 A:middle
do is select the render command

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.666 A:middle
by index using your thread ID.

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:56.576 A:middle
Then, we're going to set the

00:18:56.576 --> 00:18:57.296 A:middle
properties.

00:18:57.586 --> 00:18:58.906 A:middle
So in this example, we're

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:00.286 A:middle
setting a shader with a pipeline
