00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:00.286 A:middle
setting a shader with a pipeline

00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:03.396 A:middle
state and then a separate buffer

00:19:03.396 --> 00:19:04.976 A:middle
for the geometry and material.

00:19:05.886 --> 00:19:07.646 A:middle
And finally, this is how you

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:08.566 A:middle
encode a draw call.

00:19:09.096 --> 00:19:10.126 A:middle
Thanks to the Metal shading

00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:11.826 A:middle
language, encoding on the GPU is

00:19:11.996 --> 00:19:13.136 A:middle
really, really simple.

00:19:13.906 --> 00:19:15.486 A:middle
Even though this is in a compute

00:19:15.486 --> 00:19:17.146 A:middle
shader, this looks just like

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:18.106 A:middle
what you're already doing on the

00:19:18.106 --> 00:19:18.786 A:middle
CPU today.

00:19:18.786 --> 00:19:21.196 A:middle
Now, let's look at 1 more

00:19:21.196 --> 00:19:21.636 A:middle
sample.

00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:24.336 A:middle
Here are some of the basic

00:19:24.946 --> 00:19:26.706 A:middle
things you need to do to create,

00:19:26.896 --> 00:19:28.746 A:middle
encode, and execute an ICB.

00:19:29.956 --> 00:19:31.846 A:middle
To create it, you first fill out

00:19:31.846 --> 00:19:32.576 A:middle
a descriptor.

00:19:33.016 --> 00:19:34.646 A:middle
The descriptor contains things

00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:38.136 A:middle
like draw types, and inheritance

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.836 A:middle
properties, and per-stage bind

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:40.346 A:middle
counts.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.306 A:middle
This describes the way that the

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.446 A:middle
indirect buffer will behave.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:47.726 A:middle
When it's time to encode the

00:19:47.726 --> 00:19:49.506 A:middle
ICB, you simply create compute

00:19:49.506 --> 00:19:50.996 A:middle
encoder and call dispatch just

00:19:50.996 --> 00:19:51.806 A:middle
like what you've been doing

00:19:51.806 --> 00:19:52.276 A:middle
already.

00:19:54.046 --> 00:19:55.786 A:middle
Once the ICB is encoded, you can

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.306 A:middle
optionally decide if you want to

00:19:57.306 --> 00:19:58.116 A:middle
optimize it.

00:19:58.486 --> 00:19:59.786 A:middle
When you optimize it, you remove

00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:01.526 A:middle
all the redundant state, and the
