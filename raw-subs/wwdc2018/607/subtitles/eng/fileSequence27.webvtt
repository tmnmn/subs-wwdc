00:26:59.466 --> 00:27:02.076 A:middle
And tile shading is our

00:27:02.076 --> 00:27:03.336 A:middle
brand-new programmable stage

00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:04.326 A:middle
designed for techniques that

00:27:04.326 --> 00:27:05.526 A:middle
require mixing graphics and

00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:06.446 A:middle
compute processing.

00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:09.856 A:middle
Persistent threadgroup memory is

00:27:09.856 --> 00:27:11.106 A:middle
an important tool for combining

00:27:11.106 --> 00:27:12.456 A:middle
render and compute that allows

00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:13.556 A:middle
you to communicate across both

00:27:13.596 --> 00:27:14.556 A:middle
draws and dispatches.

00:27:15.076 --> 00:27:18.276 A:middle
And multi-sample color coverage

00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:20.026 A:middle
control lets you perform resolve

00:27:20.026 --> 00:27:21.576 A:middle
operations directly in tile

00:27:21.576 --> 00:27:23.446 A:middle
memory using tile shaders.

00:27:25.016 --> 00:27:26.036 A:middle
So I'm going to talk to you

00:27:26.036 --> 00:27:27.066 A:middle
about all these features, so

00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:27.976 A:middle
let's start with programmable

00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:28.336 A:middle
blending.

00:27:28.866 --> 00:27:33.006 A:middle
With programmable blending, your

00:27:33.006 --> 00:27:34.056 A:middle
fragment shader has read and

00:27:34.056 --> 00:27:35.436 A:middle
write access to pixels and tile

00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:35.796 A:middle
memory.

00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:37.486 A:middle
This lets you write custom

00:27:37.486 --> 00:27:38.666 A:middle
blending operations.

00:27:40.436 --> 00:27:42.256 A:middle
But programmable blending also

00:27:42.256 --> 00:27:43.626 A:middle
lets you eliminate system memory

00:27:43.626 --> 00:27:45.476 A:middle
bandwidth by combining multiple

00:27:45.476 --> 00:27:46.656 A:middle
render passes that read and

00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:47.826 A:middle
write the same attachments.

00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:50.906 A:middle
Now, deferred shading is a

00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:52.166 A:middle
particularly good fit for

00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:53.466 A:middle
programmable blending, so let's

00:27:53.466 --> 00:27:58.016 A:middle
take a closer look at that.

00:27:58.496 --> 00:27:59.506 A:middle
So deferred shading is a

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:00.456 A:middle
many-light technique
