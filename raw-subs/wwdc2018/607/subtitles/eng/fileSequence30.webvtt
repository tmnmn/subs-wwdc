00:30:00.556 --> 00:30:02.416 A:middle
So now, let's talk about

00:30:02.416 --> 00:30:04.376 A:middle
imageblocks, which allow you to

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:05.936 A:middle
merge render passes in even more

00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:06.696 A:middle
circumstances.

00:30:12.476 --> 00:30:13.546 A:middle
Imageblocks give you full

00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:14.736 A:middle
control of your data in tile

00:30:14.736 --> 00:30:15.116 A:middle
memory.

00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:17.196 A:middle
Instead of describing pixels as

00:30:17.196 --> 00:30:18.506 A:middle
arrays of render pass

00:30:18.506 --> 00:30:20.486 A:middle
attachments in the Metal API,

00:30:21.456 --> 00:30:22.696 A:middle
imageblocks let you declare your

00:30:22.696 --> 00:30:24.006 A:middle
pixel layouts directly in the

00:30:24.006 --> 00:30:25.816 A:middle
shading language as structs.

00:30:28.056 --> 00:30:29.336 A:middle
It adds new pack data types to

00:30:29.336 --> 00:30:30.556 A:middle
the shading language that match

00:30:30.556 --> 00:30:31.856 A:middle
the texture formats you already

00:30:31.856 --> 00:30:33.446 A:middle
use, and these types are

00:30:33.446 --> 00:30:35.116 A:middle
transparently packed and

00:30:35.116 --> 00:30:36.296 A:middle
unpacked when accessing the

00:30:36.296 --> 00:30:36.666 A:middle
shader.

00:30:37.646 --> 00:30:39.196 A:middle
In fact, you can also use these

00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:40.676 A:middle
new pack data types in your

00:30:40.676 --> 00:30:42.216 A:middle
vertex buffers and constant

00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:43.976 A:middle
buffers to more tightly pack all

00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:44.476 A:middle
of your data.

00:30:46.736 --> 00:30:47.946 A:middle
Imageblocks also let you

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.996 A:middle
describe more complex per-pixel

00:30:49.996 --> 00:30:50.826 A:middle
data structures.

00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:52.806 A:middle
You can use arrays, nested

00:30:52.806 --> 00:30:54.276 A:middle
structs, or combinations

00:30:54.276 --> 00:30:54.616 A:middle
thereof.

00:30:55.126 --> 00:30:56.586 A:middle
It all just works.

00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:01.016 A:middle
Now, direct control of your
