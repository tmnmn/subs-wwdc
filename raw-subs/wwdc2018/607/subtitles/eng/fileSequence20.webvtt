00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:01.526 A:middle
all the redundant state, and the

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:03.036 A:middle
end result is a lean and

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.536 A:middle
highly-efficient set of GPU

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.196 A:middle
commands.

00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:08.876 A:middle
Now, once the ICB is encoded and

00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:10.416 A:middle
optimized, it's time to schedule

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.286 A:middle
it for execution.

00:20:11.776 --> 00:20:12.986 A:middle
You notice here that you could

00:20:12.986 --> 00:20:14.996 A:middle
actually specify the exact range

00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:16.396 A:middle
of commands that you execute.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:18.736 A:middle
Also in this example, we use an

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:20.666 A:middle
indirect buffer, which itself

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:22.476 A:middle
can be encoded with a GPU.

00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:28.066 A:middle
So once the ICB is encoded, it

00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
could be reused again and again,

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.526 A:middle
and the overhead is completely

00:20:31.526 --> 00:20:32.146 A:middle
negligible.

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:33.966 A:middle
So I'm really excited, but we

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.236 A:middle
actually went ahead and we put

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:36.686 A:middle
together a sample so you could

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:37.206 A:middle
take a look.

00:20:39.216 --> 00:20:41.066 A:middle
So here you could see a number

00:20:41.066 --> 00:20:42.346 A:middle
of school buses in the middle of

00:20:42.346 --> 00:20:42.756 A:middle
a city.

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:46.766 A:middle
Each bus is composed of 500,000

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:49.726 A:middle
polygons and 2000 individual

00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:50.326 A:middle
parts.

00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:53.446 A:middle
Each part requires a separate

00:20:53.446 --> 00:20:55.116 A:middle
draw call, its own material

00:20:55.116 --> 00:20:56.836 A:middle
argument buffer, index buffer,

00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:57.636 A:middle
and vertex buffer.

00:20:58.606 --> 00:21:00.006 A:middle
As you could imagine, this would
