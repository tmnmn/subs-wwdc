00:41:57.206 --> 00:42:00.556 A:middle
The Battle Royale map is 1 map.

00:42:00.556 --> 00:42:01.936 A:middle
It's larger than 6 kilometers

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:02.426 A:middle
squared.

00:42:02.946 --> 00:42:04.976 A:middle
That means that it will not all

00:42:04.976 --> 00:42:05.856 A:middle
fit into memory.

00:42:06.466 --> 00:42:07.726 A:middle
We also have dynamic time of

00:42:07.726 --> 00:42:09.266 A:middle
day, destruction.

00:42:09.266 --> 00:42:10.476 A:middle
Players can destroy just about

00:42:10.476 --> 00:42:11.866 A:middle
any object in the scene.

00:42:12.286 --> 00:42:13.776 A:middle
Players can also build their own

00:42:13.776 --> 00:42:14.386 A:middle
structures.

00:42:14.726 --> 00:42:15.896 A:middle
So the map is very dynamic,

00:42:15.956 --> 00:42:16.916 A:middle
meaning we can't do a lot of

00:42:16.996 --> 00:42:17.856 A:middle
precomputation.

00:42:18.286 --> 00:42:21.846 A:middle
We have 100 players in the map,

00:42:21.846 --> 00:42:24.166 A:middle
and the map has over 50,000

00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:25.506 A:middle
replicating actors that are

00:42:25.506 --> 00:42:27.286 A:middle
simulated on the server and

00:42:27.286 --> 00:42:28.506 A:middle
replicated down to the client.

00:42:29.806 --> 00:42:31.216 A:middle
Finally, we wanted to support

00:42:31.216 --> 00:42:33.246 A:middle
crossplay between console and

00:42:33.246 --> 00:42:34.866 A:middle
desktop players along with

00:42:34.866 --> 00:42:35.336 A:middle
mobile.

00:42:36.126 --> 00:42:37.206 A:middle
And that's actually a really

00:42:37.206 --> 00:42:38.396 A:middle
important point because it

00:42:38.396 --> 00:42:39.926 A:middle
limited the amount that we could

00:42:39.926 --> 00:42:42.546 A:middle
scale back the game in order to

00:42:42.546 --> 00:42:45.486 A:middle
fit into the performance

00:42:45.486 --> 00:42:46.686 A:middle
constraints of the device.

00:42:47.096 --> 00:42:48.776 A:middle
Basically, if something affected

00:42:48.776 --> 00:42:50.496 A:middle
gameplay, we couldn't change it.

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:52.016 A:middle
So if there's an object and it's

00:42:52.016 --> 00:42:53.186 A:middle
really small, it's really far

00:42:53.186 --> 00:42:55.166 A:middle
away, maybe normally you would

00:42:55.316 --> 00:42:57.306 A:middle
cull it, but in this case, we

00:42:57.306 --> 00:42:58.836 A:middle
can't because if a player can

00:42:58.836 --> 00:43:00.306 A:middle
hide behind it, we need to
