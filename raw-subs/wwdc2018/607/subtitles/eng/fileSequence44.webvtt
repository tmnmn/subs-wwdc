00:43:59.456 --> 00:44:00.806 A:middle
artist-authored materials.

00:44:01.416 --> 00:44:03.616 A:middle
It's actually a pretty important

00:44:03.646 --> 00:44:05.796 A:middle
point because some of our

00:44:05.796 --> 00:44:07.536 A:middle
materials are actually very

00:44:07.596 --> 00:44:08.316 A:middle
complicated.

00:44:08.316 --> 00:44:10.786 A:middle
For instance, the imposters that

00:44:10.786 --> 00:44:12.006 A:middle
we use to render trees in the

00:44:12.006 --> 00:44:13.496 A:middle
distance efficiently were

00:44:13.496 --> 00:44:14.996 A:middle
entirely created by a technical

00:44:14.996 --> 00:44:16.636 A:middle
artist at Epic using a

00:44:16.636 --> 00:44:18.976 A:middle
combination of blueprints and

00:44:19.066 --> 00:44:20.796 A:middle
the material shader graph.

00:44:22.676 --> 00:44:24.086 A:middle
So in terms of where we ended

00:44:24.086 --> 00:44:25.896 A:middle
up, here is an image of Fortnite

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:27.696 A:middle
running on a Mac at high

00:44:27.696 --> 00:44:28.806 A:middle
scalability settings.

00:44:30.016 --> 00:44:31.506 A:middle
Here it is running on a Mac at

00:44:31.506 --> 00:44:33.716 A:middle
medium scalability settings.

00:44:34.826 --> 00:44:36.296 A:middle
And here it is on an iPhone 8

00:44:36.336 --> 00:44:36.826 A:middle
Plus.

00:44:37.296 --> 00:44:38.706 A:middle
So we were able to faithfully

00:44:38.706 --> 00:44:41.136 A:middle
represent the game on an iPhone

00:44:41.556 --> 00:44:42.836 A:middle
about at the quality that we

00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:44.276 A:middle
achieve on a mid-range Mac.

00:44:44.816 --> 00:44:48.016 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit about

00:44:48.016 --> 00:44:48.796 A:middle
scalability.

00:44:49.526 --> 00:44:50.736 A:middle
We deal with scalability both

00:44:50.736 --> 00:44:52.156 A:middle
across platforms as well as

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:53.616 A:middle
within the iOS ecosystem.

00:44:54.216 --> 00:44:55.986 A:middle
So across platform, this is

00:44:55.986 --> 00:44:57.616 A:middle
stuff that we need to fit on the

00:44:57.616 --> 00:44:59.936 A:middle
platform at all, like removing

00:44:59.936 --> 00:45:01.456 A:middle
LODs from meshes that will never
