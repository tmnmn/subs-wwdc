00:51:59.946 --> 00:52:01.446 A:middle
This is a feature we have in

00:52:01.486 --> 00:52:02.806 A:middle
Unreal where we can take

00:52:03.276 --> 00:52:04.976 A:middle
multiple draw calls and generate

00:52:04.976 --> 00:52:06.226 A:middle
a simplified version, a

00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:08.426 A:middle
simplified mesh, as well as a

00:52:08.426 --> 00:52:09.466 A:middle
material so that we can

00:52:09.466 --> 00:52:10.286 A:middle
basically render a

00:52:10.286 --> 00:52:14.176 A:middle
representation of that area in a

00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:15.036 A:middle
single draw call.

00:52:15.526 --> 00:52:18.116 A:middle
We use this for taking POIs and

00:52:18.356 --> 00:52:19.566 A:middle
generating the simplified

00:52:19.566 --> 00:52:20.906 A:middle
versions for rendering very,

00:52:20.906 --> 00:52:21.646 A:middle
very far away.

00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:22.816 A:middle
For instance, during the

00:52:22.816 --> 00:52:24.386 A:middle
skydive, you can see the entire

00:52:24.386 --> 00:52:24.696 A:middle
map.

00:52:25.166 --> 00:52:26.296 A:middle
In fact, when you're on the map,

00:52:26.296 --> 00:52:28.086 A:middle
you can get on a cliff or just

00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:29.606 A:middle
build a very high tower of your

00:52:29.606 --> 00:52:32.096 A:middle
own and see points of interest

00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:33.616 A:middle
from up to 2 kilometers away.

00:52:35.936 --> 00:52:38.056 A:middle
Digging into some of the other

00:52:38.056 --> 00:52:40.476 A:middle
details on the Metal side, I

00:52:40.476 --> 00:52:41.376 A:middle
want to talk a little bit about

00:52:41.376 --> 00:52:42.366 A:middle
pipeline state objects.

00:52:42.366 --> 00:52:43.546 A:middle
This was something that took us

00:52:43.546 --> 00:52:44.706 A:middle
a little bit of time to get into

00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:46.146 A:middle
a shippable state for Fortnite.

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.116 A:middle
You really want to minimize how

00:52:48.116 --> 00:52:50.446 A:middle
many PSOs you're creating while

00:52:50.446 --> 00:52:51.576 A:middle
you're simulating the game

00:52:51.576 --> 00:52:52.286 A:middle
during the frame.

00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:53.816 A:middle
If you create too many, it's

00:52:53.816 --> 00:52:55.396 A:middle
very easy to hitch and create a

00:52:55.396 --> 00:52:56.686 A:middle
poor player experience.

00:52:57.236 --> 00:52:58.606 A:middle
So first of all, follow best

00:52:58.606 --> 00:52:59.456 A:middle
practices, right.

00:52:59.846 --> 00:53:01.266 A:middle
