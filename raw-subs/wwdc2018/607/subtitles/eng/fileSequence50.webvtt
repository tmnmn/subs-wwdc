00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:00.206 A:middle
session.

00:50:01.976 --> 00:50:03.726 A:middle
Going to talk a little bit about

00:50:03.726 --> 00:50:04.896 A:middle
metal specifically.

00:50:05.716 --> 00:50:09.006 A:middle
So we, on most devices, we have

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.786 A:middle
2 cores, right, and so the way

00:50:11.786 --> 00:50:13.626 A:middle
we utilize that is we have a

00:50:14.206 --> 00:50:14.966 A:middle
traditional game

00:50:14.966 --> 00:50:16.196 A:middle
thread/rendering thread split.

00:50:16.576 --> 00:50:17.676 A:middle
On the game thread, we're doing

00:50:17.676 --> 00:50:19.086 A:middle
networking, simulation,

00:50:19.086 --> 00:50:20.746 A:middle
animation, physics, and so on.

00:50:21.316 --> 00:50:22.546 A:middle
The rendering thread does all of

00:50:22.546 --> 00:50:24.576 A:middle
scene traversal, culling, and

00:50:24.576 --> 00:50:25.796 A:middle
issues all of the Metal API

00:50:25.796 --> 00:50:26.316 A:middle
calls.

00:50:26.646 --> 00:50:29.316 A:middle
We also have an async thread.

00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.026 A:middle
Mostly, it's handling streaming

00:50:31.026 --> 00:50:32.796 A:middle
tasks -- texture streaming as

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:34.386 A:middle
well as level streaming.

00:50:36.006 --> 00:50:37.726 A:middle
On newer devices where we have 2

00:50:37.726 --> 00:50:39.996 A:middle
fast and 4 efficient cores, we

00:50:39.996 --> 00:50:41.456 A:middle
add 3 more task threads and

00:50:41.456 --> 00:50:42.656 A:middle
enable some of the parallel

00:50:42.656 --> 00:50:44.186 A:middle
algorithms available in Unreal.

00:50:44.796 --> 00:50:47.476 A:middle
So we take animation, put it,

00:50:47.476 --> 00:50:48.526 A:middle
simulate it over on multiple

00:50:48.526 --> 00:50:51.126 A:middle
frames, CPU particles, physics,

00:50:51.126 --> 00:50:53.926 A:middle
and so on, scene culling, a

00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:55.056 A:middle
couple other tasks.

00:50:57.376 --> 00:50:59.166 A:middle
I mentioned draw calls earlier.

00:50:59.296 --> 00:51:00.916 A:middle
Draw calls were our main
