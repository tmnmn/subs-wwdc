Metal to apply the results to

00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:01.136 A:middle
all samples of the pixel.

00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:03.876 A:middle
And since all samples now share

00:41:03.876 --> 00:41:05.486 A:middle
the same value, the later

00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:06.426 A:middle
particle draws are going to

00:41:06.426 --> 00:41:08.276 A:middle
blend per pixel rather than per

00:41:08.276 --> 00:41:08.646 A:middle
sample.

00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:12.696 A:middle
So that's it for sample coverage

00:41:12.696 --> 00:41:13.056 A:middle
control.

00:41:15.736 --> 00:41:18.216 A:middle
Now, optimizing for Apple GPUs

00:41:18.216 --> 00:41:19.306 A:middle
is really important for

00:41:19.306 --> 00:41:20.556 A:middle
maximizing your game's

00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:21.926 A:middle
performance and extending its

00:41:21.966 --> 00:41:23.806 A:middle
playtime, but there's a lot more

00:41:23.806 --> 00:41:25.236 A:middle
work that goes into shipping a

00:41:25.236 --> 00:41:27.036 A:middle
tile in iOS, especially one

00:41:27.036 --> 00:41:27.946 A:middle
that's originally designed for

00:41:27.946 --> 00:41:28.986 A:middle
desktops and consoles.

00:41:29.476 --> 00:41:31.266 A:middle
To talk about that now and to

00:41:31.266 --> 00:41:32.456 A:middle
put into practice what we just

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:34.036 A:middle
discussed, I'd like to bring on

00:41:34.036 --> 00:41:35.716 A:middle
Nick Penwarden from Epic Games.

00:41:36.146 --> 00:41:36.386 A:middle
Nick?

00:41:38.516 --> 00:41:40.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:41.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Michael.

00:41:42.876 --> 00:41:44.086 A:middle
So, yeah. I'd like to talk a

00:41:44.086 --> 00:41:46.236 A:middle
little bit about how we took a

00:41:46.236 --> 00:41:47.906 A:middle
game that was originally made

00:41:47.986 --> 00:41:50.786 A:middle
for desktop and console

00:41:50.786 --> 00:41:52.826 A:middle
platforms and brought it to iOS

00:41:52.826 --> 00:41:53.326 A:middle
using Metal.

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:56.126 A:middle
So some of the technical

00:41:56.126 --> 00:41:57.206 A:middle
challenges we faced.

00:41:57.206 --> 00:42:00.556 A:middle
The Battle Royale map is 1 map.
