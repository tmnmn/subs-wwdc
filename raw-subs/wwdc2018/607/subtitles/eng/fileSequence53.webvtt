00:52:59.846 --> 00:53:01.266 A:middle
Compile your functions offline,

00:53:01.266 --> 00:53:03.426 A:middle
build your library offline, and

00:53:03.476 --> 00:53:04.566 A:middle
pull all of your functions into

00:53:04.566 --> 00:53:05.326 A:middle
a single library.

00:53:05.846 --> 00:53:07.056 A:middle
But you really want to make sure

00:53:07.056 --> 00:53:08.656 A:middle
you create all of your PSOs at

00:53:08.656 --> 00:53:09.146 A:middle
load time.

00:53:09.556 --> 00:53:10.986 A:middle
But what do you do if you can't

00:53:10.986 --> 00:53:11.346 A:middle
do that?

00:53:11.786 --> 00:53:12.966 A:middle
So for us, the permutation

00:53:12.966 --> 00:53:14.086 A:middle
matrix is just crazy.

00:53:14.136 --> 00:53:15.516 A:middle
There's way too many for us to

00:53:15.516 --> 00:53:16.826 A:middle
realistically create at load

00:53:17.576 --> 00:53:18.016 A:middle
time.

00:53:18.076 --> 00:53:20.586 A:middle
We have multiple artist-authored

00:53:20.586 --> 00:53:22.286 A:middle
shaders -- thousands of them --

00:53:22.846 --> 00:53:24.306 A:middle
multiple lighting scenarios

00:53:24.306 --> 00:53:26.356 A:middle
based on number of shadow

00:53:26.356 --> 00:53:28.926 A:middle
cascades and so on, different

00:53:28.926 --> 00:53:30.546 A:middle
render target formats, MSAA.

00:53:30.776 --> 00:53:31.516 A:middle
The list goes on.

00:53:32.726 --> 00:53:33.576 A:middle
We tried to minimize

00:53:33.576 --> 00:53:35.116 A:middle
permutations where we could, and

00:53:35.116 --> 00:53:35.776 A:middle
this does help.

00:53:35.776 --> 00:53:37.136 A:middle
Sometimes a dynamic branch is

00:53:37.136 --> 00:53:38.626 A:middle
good enough and better than

00:53:38.626 --> 00:53:40.046 A:middle
creating a static permutation,

00:53:40.646 --> 00:53:42.356 A:middle
but sometimes not.

00:53:42.736 --> 00:53:44.716 A:middle
What we had to do is we decided

00:53:44.716 --> 00:53:45.966 A:middle
to identify the most common

00:53:45.966 --> 00:53:47.186 A:middle
subset that we're likely to

00:53:47.186 --> 00:53:48.816 A:middle
need, and we create those at

00:53:48.816 --> 00:53:49.196 A:middle
load.

00:53:49.566 --> 00:53:50.346 A:middle
We don't try to create

00:53:50.346 --> 00:53:50.856 A:middle
everything.

00:53:51.306 --> 00:53:52.576 A:middle
The way we achieved this is we

00:53:52.576 --> 00:53:54.116 A:middle
created an automation pass where

00:53:54.116 --> 00:53:55.296 A:middle
we basically flew a camera

00:53:55.296 --> 00:53:56.716 A:middle
through the environment and

00:53:56.716 --> 00:53:58.116 A:middle
recorded all of the PSOs that we

00:53:58.116 --> 00:53:59.286 A:middle
actually needed to render the

00:53:59.286 --> 00:53:59.876 A:middle
environment.
