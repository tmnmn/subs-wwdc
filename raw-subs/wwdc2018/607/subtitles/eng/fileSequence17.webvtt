00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:01.846 A:middle
visible objects and LODs coming

00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:03.076 A:middle
from our culling dispatch.

00:17:03.796 --> 00:17:05.165 A:middle
Also, keep in mind that we're

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:06.526 A:middle
utilizing the power of argument

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.066 A:middle
buffers here.

00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:09.866 A:middle
So in this case, each element

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:12.816 A:middle
has a pointer to the actual

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:14.165 A:middle
properties, so we don't need to

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:15.496 A:middle
store everything in the same

00:17:15.496 --> 00:17:15.896 A:middle
buffer.

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:20.136 A:middle
This solution saves us a lot of

00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:21.906 A:middle
memory and performance, and it's

00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:23.726 A:middle
because we only build a very

00:17:23.726 --> 00:17:25.126 A:middle
small list of information.

00:17:25.896 --> 00:17:27.026 A:middle
The actual argument buffer

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:28.786 A:middle
contains several levels of

00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:29.866 A:middle
detail for geometry.

00:17:30.936 --> 00:17:33.726 A:middle
This includes position, vertex

00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:35.406 A:middle
buffer, index buffer, and a

00:17:35.406 --> 00:17:36.626 A:middle
material argument buffer.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.486 A:middle
For rendering, we only select 1

00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:41.206 A:middle
of these LODs per object.

00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:45.026 A:middle
The actual encoding happens in a

00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:47.126 A:middle
compute kernel, and we encode

00:17:47.126 --> 00:17:48.716 A:middle
into an indirect command buffer.

00:17:49.826 --> 00:17:51.716 A:middle
Each thread of the compute

00:17:51.716 --> 00:17:53.466 A:middle
kernel encodes a single draw

00:17:53.466 --> 00:17:53.756 A:middle
call.

00:17:54.226 --> 00:17:55.976 A:middle
So we read the object with all

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:58.756 A:middle
of its properties, and we encode

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.526 A:middle
these into the ICB.
