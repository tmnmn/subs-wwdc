00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:01.126 A:middle
show you how to optimize for the

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:03.086 A:middle
A11 to improve performance

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:04.286 A:middle
extend playtime.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.616 A:middle
And finally, I'm really excited

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:09.756 A:middle
that we're going to be joined by

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.386 A:middle
Nick Penwarden from Epic Games.

00:03:12.736 --> 00:03:14.366 A:middle
He is going to show us how

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.836 A:middle
they've used Metal to bring

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:17.736 A:middle
console-level games to our

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:18.206 A:middle
devices.

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:23.286 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.176 A:middle
Harnessing both CPU and GPU

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:27.526 A:middle
parallelism is probably the most

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:28.816 A:middle
important and easiest

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:32.116 A:middle
optimization you can make.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.346 A:middle
Building a command stream on a

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.996 A:middle
single thread is not sufficient

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:35.476 A:middle
anymore.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
The latest iPhone has 6 cores,

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:39.836 A:middle
and the iMac Pro can have up to

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:40.476 A:middle
18.

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.876 A:middle
So scalable, multithreaded

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:45.856 A:middle
architecture is key to great

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:48.396 A:middle
performance on all of our

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:49.896 A:middle
devices.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.286 A:middle
Metal is designed for

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:51.936 A:middle
multithreading.

00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:53.736 A:middle
I'm going to show you 2 ways how

00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:55.966 A:middle
to parallelize on the CPU, and

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:56.826 A:middle
then I'm going to close this

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:58.526 A:middle
section by showing you how Metal

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:00.036 A:middle
could automatically parallelize
