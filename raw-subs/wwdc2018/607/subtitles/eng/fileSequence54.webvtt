00:54:00.316 --> 00:54:01.226 A:middle
Then, during our daily

00:54:01.226 --> 00:54:03.396 A:middle
playtests, we harvested any PSOs

00:54:03.396 --> 00:54:06.106 A:middle
that were created that were not

00:54:06.106 --> 00:54:07.576 A:middle
caught by that automation pass.

00:54:07.966 --> 00:54:09.276 A:middle
The automation pass also

00:54:09.756 --> 00:54:12.476 A:middle
catches, like, cosmetics, and

00:54:12.896 --> 00:54:14.176 A:middle
effects from firing different

00:54:14.176 --> 00:54:15.136 A:middle
weapons, and so on.

00:54:16.556 --> 00:54:18.056 A:middle
We take all of that information

00:54:18.056 --> 00:54:19.126 A:middle
from automation and from the

00:54:19.126 --> 00:54:20.276 A:middle
playtest, combine it into a

00:54:20.276 --> 00:54:20.666 A:middle
list.

00:54:20.856 --> 00:54:22.486 A:middle
That's what we create at load

00:54:22.486 --> 00:54:23.856 A:middle
time, and that's what we ship

00:54:23.856 --> 00:54:24.416 A:middle
with the game.

00:54:24.956 --> 00:54:26.266 A:middle
It's not perfect, but we find

00:54:26.266 --> 00:54:27.556 A:middle
that the number of PSOs we

00:54:27.556 --> 00:54:28.686 A:middle
create at runtime is in the

00:54:28.686 --> 00:54:30.136 A:middle
single digits for any given play

00:54:30.136 --> 00:54:31.146 A:middle
session, on average.

00:54:31.516 --> 00:54:32.926 A:middle
And so players don't experience

00:54:32.926 --> 00:54:34.846 A:middle
any hitching from PSO creation.

00:54:37.356 --> 00:54:39.096 A:middle
Resource allocation.

00:54:39.196 --> 00:54:43.216 A:middle
So basically, creating and

00:54:43.366 --> 00:54:46.466 A:middle
deleting resources is expensive

00:54:46.466 --> 00:54:47.326 A:middle
or can be expensive.

00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:50.046 A:middle
It's kind of like, think of

00:54:50.046 --> 00:54:50.113 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:54:50.113 --> 00:54:51.166 A:middle
You really want to minimize the

00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:52.276 A:middle
number of [inaudible] you're

00:54:52.276 --> 00:54:53.036 A:middle
making per frame.

00:54:53.436 --> 00:54:54.246 A:middle
You really don't want to be

00:54:54.246 --> 00:54:55.416 A:middle
creating and destroying a lot of

00:54:55.416 --> 00:54:57.246 A:middle
resources on the fly, but when

00:54:57.246 --> 00:54:58.476 A:middle
you're streaming in content

00:54:58.656 --> 00:55:00.606 A:middle
dynamically, when you have a lot
