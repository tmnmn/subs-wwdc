00:10:58.906 --> 00:11:00.856 A:middle
So in this example, the G-buffer

00:11:00.856 --> 00:11:02.576 A:middle
updates the fence, and the

00:11:02.576 --> 00:11:03.766 A:middle
deferred shading waits for it.

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:08.266 A:middle
So now, let's take a look at how

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:09.406 A:middle
we could apply these basic

00:11:09.406 --> 00:11:10.966 A:middle
concepts in your code.

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:15.206 A:middle
So the first thing that we're

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:16.006 A:middle
going to do is we're going to

00:11:16.006 --> 00:11:17.456 A:middle
apply this to our G-buffer and

00:11:17.456 --> 00:11:18.676 A:middle
deferred shading example.

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:21.356 A:middle
First, we're going to allocate

00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:23.046 A:middle
our temporary render target from

00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:23.436 A:middle
the heap.

00:11:23.806 --> 00:11:24.866 A:middle
This looks just like what you're

00:11:24.866 --> 00:11:26.046 A:middle
probably already doing today

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:28.706 A:middle
when you allocate a texture.

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:31.056 A:middle
Next, we're going to render into

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:32.246 A:middle
that temporary render target.

00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:35.646 A:middle
And finally, update the fence

00:11:36.316 --> 00:11:37.566 A:middle
after the fragment stage

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:38.216 A:middle
completes.

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:39.526 A:middle
This will ensure that all the

00:11:39.526 --> 00:11:41.656 A:middle
data is produced before the next

00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:42.956 A:middle
pass consumes it.

00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:45.876 A:middle
So now, let's switch gears over

00:11:45.876 --> 00:11:47.356 A:middle
to the deferred shading pass.

00:11:48.156 --> 00:11:49.936 A:middle
Now, we're going to use this

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:51.346 A:middle
temporary render target to

00:11:51.346 --> 00:11:52.606 A:middle
compute material lighting.

00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:56.196 A:middle
Then, we're going to wait for

00:11:56.196 --> 00:11:57.986 A:middle
the fence to make sure that it's

00:11:58.046 --> 00:11:59.476 A:middle
been produced before we consume

00:11:59.476 --> 00:11:59.566 A:middle
it.
