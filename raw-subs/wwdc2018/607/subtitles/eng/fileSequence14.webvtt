00:14:00.466 --> 00:14:02.346 A:middle
So argument buffers allow you to

00:14:02.986 --> 00:14:04.536 A:middle
offload the material management

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.036 A:middle
onto the GPU and save valuable

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.366 A:middle
CPU resources.

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:10.206 A:middle
But this year, we're putting it

00:14:10.206 --> 00:14:11.546 A:middle
a little bit, extending it a

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:13.436 A:middle
little bit more.

00:14:13.926 --> 00:14:15.506 A:middle
We started by adding 2 new

00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:16.516 A:middle
argument types.

00:14:17.426 --> 00:14:19.046 A:middle
This includes pipeline states

00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:20.126 A:middle
and command buffers.

00:14:21.056 --> 00:14:22.646 A:middle
Now, these are used to support

00:14:22.646 --> 00:14:24.226 A:middle
our brand-new indirect command

00:14:24.226 --> 00:14:24.836 A:middle
buffer feature.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.916 A:middle
With indirect command buffers,

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:30.266 A:middle
you could encode entire scenes

00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:30.956 A:middle
on the GPU.

00:14:31.506 --> 00:14:33.066 A:middle
On the CPU, you only have a few

00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:34.426 A:middle
threads available for rendering,

00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:35.936 A:middle
but on the GPU, you have

00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:37.986 A:middle
hundreds or even thousands of

00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:40.036 A:middle
threads all running at the same

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:40.976 A:middle
time.

00:14:41.716 --> 00:14:42.856 A:middle
With indirect command buffers,

00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:44.416 A:middle
you can fully utilize this

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:45.916 A:middle
massively parallel nature.

00:14:47.236 --> 00:14:49.186 A:middle
Also, indirect command buffers

00:14:49.186 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
are completely reusable, so you

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:52.556 A:middle
could spend the encoding cost

00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:54.866 A:middle
once and reuse it again and

00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:55.196 A:middle
again.

00:14:55.886 --> 00:14:57.626 A:middle
And since an ICB is a directly

00:14:57.716 --> 00:15:00.276 A:middle
accessible buffer, you can
