00:48:58.546 --> 00:49:00.096 A:middle
automation pass that goes

00:49:00.096 --> 00:49:00.496 A:middle
through.

00:49:00.976 --> 00:49:04.106 A:middle
We look at key locations in the

00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:06.056 A:middle
map, and we capture performance.

00:49:06.056 --> 00:49:08.126 A:middle
So for instance, Tilted Towers,

00:49:08.126 --> 00:49:09.616 A:middle
and Shifty Shafts, and all of

00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:11.396 A:middle
the usual POIs that you're

00:49:11.396 --> 00:49:12.756 A:middle
familiar with in Battle Royale.

00:49:13.356 --> 00:49:15.126 A:middle
When one goes over budget, we

00:49:15.126 --> 00:49:16.506 A:middle
know we need to dive in, figure

00:49:16.506 --> 00:49:17.676 A:middle
out where performance is going,

00:49:17.676 --> 00:49:18.356 A:middle
and optimize.

00:49:18.966 --> 00:49:20.486 A:middle
We also have daily 100-player

00:49:20.486 --> 00:49:22.346 A:middle
playtests where we capture the

00:49:22.346 --> 00:49:23.566 A:middle
dynamic performance that you'll

00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:24.696 A:middle
only see during a game.

00:49:25.246 --> 00:49:26.436 A:middle
We track key performance over

00:49:26.436 --> 00:49:29.376 A:middle
time for the match, and then we

00:49:29.376 --> 00:49:30.116 A:middle
can take a look at this

00:49:30.116 --> 00:49:32.176 A:middle
afterwards and see how it

00:49:32.176 --> 00:49:34.566 A:middle
performed, look for hitches,

00:49:34.566 --> 00:49:35.296 A:middle
stuff like that.

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.966 A:middle
And if something looks off, we

00:49:37.966 --> 00:49:39.596 A:middle
can pull an instrumented profile

00:49:39.596 --> 00:49:41.256 A:middle
off of the device, take a look

00:49:41.256 --> 00:49:42.686 A:middle
at where time was going, and

00:49:42.686 --> 00:49:43.496 A:middle
figure out where we need to

00:49:43.496 --> 00:49:44.106 A:middle
optimize.

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:46.336 A:middle
We also support replays.

00:49:46.336 --> 00:49:48.956 A:middle
This is a feature in Unreal that

00:49:48.956 --> 00:49:50.546 A:middle
allow us to go and replay that

00:49:50.546 --> 00:49:51.986 A:middle
match from a client perspective.

00:49:51.986 --> 00:49:53.266 A:middle
So we can play it over and over,

00:49:53.266 --> 00:49:55.706 A:middle
analyze it, profile it, and even

00:49:55.706 --> 00:49:57.306 A:middle
see how optimizations would have

00:49:57.306 --> 00:49:59.746 A:middle
affected the client in that play

00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:00.206 A:middle
session.
