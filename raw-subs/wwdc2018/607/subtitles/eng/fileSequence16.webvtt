00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:00.496 A:middle
visible objects onto the GPU.

00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:03.236 A:middle
GPUs are just better at handling

00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:04.906 A:middle
the growing scene complexity of

00:16:04.906 --> 00:16:05.796 A:middle
the latest games.

00:16:06.936 --> 00:16:09.526 A:middle
Unfortunately, this creates a

00:16:09.526 --> 00:16:10.816 A:middle
sync point in your frame.

00:16:12.456 --> 00:16:14.486 A:middle
And the, it makes it so that the

00:16:14.486 --> 00:16:16.266 A:middle
CPU cannot encode draw calls

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.996 A:middle
until the GPU produces the data.

00:16:18.466 --> 00:16:19.826 A:middle
It's extremely difficult to get

00:16:19.826 --> 00:16:21.436 A:middle
this right without wasting

00:16:21.436 --> 00:16:23.766 A:middle
valuable CPU and GPU time on

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
synchronization.

00:16:25.716 --> 00:16:27.566 A:middle
With ICBs, the benefits are

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:28.216 A:middle
immense.

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:30.176 A:middle
Not only can you move the final

00:16:30.176 --> 00:16:32.086 A:middle
bits of processing to the GPU,

00:16:32.646 --> 00:16:34.176 A:middle
you naturally remove any sync

00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:35.426 A:middle
points required to hand over the

00:16:35.426 --> 00:16:37.766 A:middle
data and you improve your CPU

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:39.076 A:middle
and GPU utilization.

00:16:39.706 --> 00:16:42.116 A:middle
At the same time, you reduce

00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:43.886 A:middle
your CPU overhead to a constant.

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:47.086 A:middle
So let's look at the encoding in

00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:48.136 A:middle
a little bit more detail.

00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:51.806 A:middle
I'm going to start by expanding

00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:53.566 A:middle
on our previous example and look

00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:55.316 A:middle
at the massively parallel nature

00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:57.216 A:middle
that only the GPU can provide.

00:16:57.876 --> 00:16:59.736 A:middle
We could begin with the list of

00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:01.846 A:middle
visible objects and LODs coming
