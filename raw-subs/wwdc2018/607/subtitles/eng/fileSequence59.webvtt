&gt;&gt; So Metal is low overhead out

00:59:01.596 --> 00:59:03.696 A:middle
of the box, but rendering many

00:59:03.696 --> 00:59:05.106 A:middle
objects efficiently can require

00:59:05.106 --> 00:59:05.836 A:middle
multithreading.

00:59:06.246 --> 00:59:07.736 A:middle
Metal is built to take advantage

00:59:07.736 --> 00:59:09.736 A:middle
of all the GPU, all the CPUs in

00:59:09.736 --> 00:59:10.366 A:middle
our systems.

00:59:11.326 --> 00:59:13.156 A:middle
Metal is also really accessible,

00:59:13.156 --> 00:59:14.776 A:middle
but advanced rendering sometimes

00:59:14.776 --> 00:59:16.106 A:middle
requires explicit control.

00:59:16.856 --> 00:59:18.386 A:middle
Metal provides this control when

00:59:18.386 --> 00:59:19.226 A:middle
you need it for memory

00:59:19.226 --> 00:59:21.306 A:middle
management and GPU parallelism.

00:59:22.526 --> 00:59:23.816 A:middle
We also introduced indirect

00:59:23.816 --> 00:59:25.026 A:middle
command buffers, our brand-new

00:59:25.026 --> 00:59:26.116 A:middle
feature that lets you move

00:59:26.116 --> 00:59:27.616 A:middle
command generation entirely to

00:59:27.616 --> 00:59:29.666 A:middle
the GPU, freeing the CPU for

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:30.276 A:middle
other tasks.

00:59:31.106 --> 00:59:32.666 A:middle
Together with argument buffers,

00:59:32.906 --> 00:59:33.816 A:middle
these features provide a

00:59:33.816 --> 00:59:35.616 A:middle
complete solution to GPU-driven

00:59:35.616 --> 00:59:36.216 A:middle
pipelines.

00:59:37.306 --> 00:59:39.236 A:middle
And finally, Metal lets you

00:59:39.236 --> 00:59:40.086 A:middle
leverage the advanced

00:59:40.086 --> 00:59:42.256 A:middle
architecture of the A11 GPU to

00:59:42.256 --> 00:59:43.426 A:middle
optimize many rendering

00:59:43.426 --> 00:59:44.796 A:middle
techniques for both maximum

00:59:44.796 --> 00:59:46.566 A:middle
performance and extended

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:47.396 A:middle
playtime.

00:59:49.126 --> 00:59:50.896 A:middle

00:59:50.896 --> 00:59:52.656 A:middle
visit our website, and be sure

00:59:52.736 --> 00:59:54.256 A:middle
to visit us in tomorrow's lab.

00:59:55.136 --> 00:59:55.446 A:middle
Thank you.
