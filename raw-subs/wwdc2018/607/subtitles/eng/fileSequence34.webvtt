00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:00.716 A:middle
depth bounds and per-tile light

00:34:00.716 --> 00:34:02.106 A:middle
lists using that scene depth

00:34:02.106 --> 00:34:02.446 A:middle
buffer.

00:34:03.326 --> 00:34:04.886 A:middle
And finally, another render pass

00:34:04.886 --> 00:34:05.956 A:middle
is going to shade the pixels in

00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:07.096 A:middle
each tile using the

00:34:07.096 --> 00:34:08.096 A:middle
corresponding light list.

00:34:08.706 --> 00:34:13.235 A:middle
Now, this pattern of mixing

00:34:13.235 --> 00:34:14.386 A:middle
render with compute occurs

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:14.976 A:middle
frequently.

00:34:14.976 --> 00:34:17.366 A:middle
And prior to A11, communicating

00:34:17.366 --> 00:34:18.585 A:middle
across these passes required

00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:19.226 A:middle
system memory.

00:34:19.936 --> 00:34:21.755 A:middle
But with tile shading, we can

00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:22.856 A:middle
inline the compute so that the

00:34:22.856 --> 00:34:24.036 A:middle
render passes can be merged.

00:34:26.396 --> 00:34:28.356 A:middle
Here the depth bounds and light

00:34:28.356 --> 00:34:29.476 A:middle
culling steps are now

00:34:29.476 --> 00:34:31.036 A:middle
implemented as tile shaders and

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.076 A:middle
inlined into a single render

00:34:32.076 --> 00:34:32.576 A:middle
pass.

00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:34.735 A:middle
Depth is now only stored in the

00:34:34.735 --> 00:34:36.426 A:middle
imageblock and, but is

00:34:36.525 --> 00:34:37.966 A:middle
accessible across the entire

00:34:42.596 --> 00:34:42.706 A:middle
pass.

00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:44.496 A:middle
So, now, tile shading is going

00:34:44.496 --> 00:34:45.696 A:middle
to help you eliminate a lot of

00:34:45.696 --> 00:34:47.626 A:middle
bandwidth, but these tile shader

00:34:47.626 --> 00:34:48.876 A:middle
outputs are still being stored

00:34:48.876 --> 00:34:49.545 A:middle
to system memory.

00:34:50.545 --> 00:34:51.826 A:middle
Tile shader dispatches are

00:34:51.826 --> 00:34:53.226 A:middle
synchronized with draws, so

00:34:53.226 --> 00:34:54.286 A:middle
that's completely safe to do,

00:34:54.656 --> 00:34:55.606 A:middle
but I think we could still do

00:34:55.606 --> 00:34:57.136 A:middle
better using our next feature,

00:34:57.706 --> 00:34:59.426 A:middle
persistent threadgroup memory.
