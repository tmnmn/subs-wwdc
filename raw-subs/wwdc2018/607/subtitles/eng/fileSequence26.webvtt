00:26:00.456 --> 00:26:01.736 A:middle
You get them just by using Metal

00:26:01.736 --> 00:26:02.306 A:middle
on iOS.

00:26:03.106 --> 00:26:04.866 A:middle
But Metal also lets you optimize

00:26:04.866 --> 00:26:06.036 A:middle
rendering techniques by taking

00:26:06.036 --> 00:26:07.796 A:middle
explicit control of the A11's

00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:08.596 A:middle
tile memory.

00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:12.166 A:middle
Now, during the development of

00:26:12.166 --> 00:26:13.866 A:middle
the A11 GPU, the hardware and

00:26:13.866 --> 00:26:15.346 A:middle
software teams at Apple analyzed

00:26:15.346 --> 00:26:16.946 A:middle
a number of important modern

00:26:16.946 --> 00:26:17.846 A:middle
rendering techniques.

00:26:18.696 --> 00:26:20.406 A:middle
We accelerated, we noticed many

00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:22.166 A:middle
common themes, and we found that

00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:23.476 A:middle
explicit control of our tile

00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:26.906 A:middle
memory accelerated all of them.

00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:28.036 A:middle
We then developed the hardware

00:26:28.036 --> 00:26:29.656 A:middle
and software features together

00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:30.946 A:middle
around this idea of explicit

00:26:30.946 --> 00:26:31.416 A:middle
control.

00:26:32.656 --> 00:26:33.626 A:middle
So let's talk about these

00:26:34.806 --> 00:26:34.976 A:middle
features.

00:26:41.656 --> 00:26:42.796 A:middle
So programmable blending lets

00:26:42.796 --> 00:26:43.676 A:middle
you write custom blend

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:44.976 A:middle
operations in your shaders.

00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:46.686 A:middle
It's also a powerful tool you

00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:48.146 A:middle
can use to merge render passes,

00:26:48.406 --> 00:26:49.396 A:middle
and it's actually made available

00:26:49.396 --> 00:26:51.446 A:middle
across all iOS GPUs.

00:26:52.136 --> 00:26:53.726 A:middle
Imageblocks are new for A11.

00:26:53.996 --> 00:26:55.046 A:middle
They let you maximize your use

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.756 A:middle
of tile memory by controlling

00:26:56.756 --> 00:26:58.116 A:middle
pixel layouts directly in the

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:58.936 A:middle
shading language.

00:26:59.466 --> 00:27:02.076 A:middle
And tile shading is our
