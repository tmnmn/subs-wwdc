00:04:56.726 --> 00:05:00.136 A:middle
So side-scrolling states, hover

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:02.366 A:middle
states, they can all give the

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:04.156 A:middle
allusion of straightforward,

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:05.846 A:middle
clean, easy-to-use interface.

00:05:07.116 --> 00:05:08.606 A:middle
But testing with VoiceOver goes

00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
beyond that, and so it allows

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:13.726 A:middle
you to discover new challenges

00:05:13.856 --> 00:05:18.366 A:middle
and insights, and finally, I

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:19.656 A:middle
believe VoiceOver gets really at

00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:20.646 A:middle
the heart of what we do.

00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:24.526 A:middle
As iOS developers, we pride

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:25.566 A:middle
ourselves on creating

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.366 A:middle
easy-to-use, easy-to-understand

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:28.986 A:middle
apps.

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:33.006 A:middle
Well those values are especially

00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:34.406 A:middle
apparent when using VoiceOver.

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:39.626 A:middle
So my question to you today is

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.876 A:middle
your app so easy to use you

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:42.726 A:middle
could use it with your eyes

00:05:42.726 --> 00:05:43.246 A:middle
closed?

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:46.886 A:middle
And that's not a question just

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:47.936 A:middle
for testers.

00:05:47.936 --> 00:05:49.906 A:middle
That's a question for designers,

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:50.546 A:middle
for developers.

00:05:50.806 --> 00:05:53.816 A:middle
Anyone responsible for creating

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.226 A:middle
the best experience possible for

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:55.866 A:middle
our users.

00:05:56.826 --> 00:05:58.606 A:middle
And the only way to answer that

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.796 A:middle
question is to start testing
