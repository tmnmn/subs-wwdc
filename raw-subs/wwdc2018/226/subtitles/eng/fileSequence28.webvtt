00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:06.906 A:middle
So, yes, I'm going to call you

00:28:06.906 --> 00:28:10.526 A:middle
out individually now, and, but

00:28:10.526 --> 00:28:11.576 A:middle
no, in review.

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:14.036 A:middle
VoiceOver is an alternative way

00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:14.916 A:middle
of using your app.

00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:18.026 A:middle
And you can navigate and

00:28:18.026 --> 00:28:19.846 A:middle
activate elements based on just

00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:20.666 A:middle
how they're labeled.

00:28:21.046 --> 00:28:25.456 A:middle
And you can explore other apps

00:28:25.456 --> 00:28:27.076 A:middle
to learn expected behavior.

00:28:28.516 --> 00:28:31.396 A:middle
And then rediscover your app by

00:28:31.396 --> 00:28:33.286 A:middle
hearing it to help identify

00:28:33.436 --> 00:28:34.766 A:middle
other issues.

00:28:35.326 --> 00:28:38.786 A:middle
So here's some steps I want you

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:41.186 A:middle
to do as soon as you leave

00:28:42.236 --> 00:28:42.386 A:middle
today.

00:28:42.566 --> 00:28:44.196 A:middle
Just like Ryan suggested, I want

00:28:44.196 --> 00:28:45.816 A:middle
you to close your eyes and test

00:28:45.816 --> 00:28:46.136 A:middle
your app.

00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:49.586 A:middle
So really experience this.

00:28:49.586 --> 00:28:51.626 A:middle
Start identify issues that

00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.346 A:middle
prevent users from getting the

00:28:53.346 --> 00:28:55.026 A:middle
most out of your app.

00:28:55.906 --> 00:28:58.456 A:middle
And then open your eyes and

00:28:58.456 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
confirm that experience, because
