00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.196 A:middle
you receive a lot more visual

00:16:00.196 --> 00:16:02.236 A:middle
information than just words on a

00:16:02.236 --> 00:16:02.776 A:middle
page.

00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:06.066 A:middle
Here's that same newspaper.

00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:10.776 A:middle
If we fail to infer all of that

00:16:10.776 --> 00:16:12.496 A:middle
additional information, like

00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:16.566 A:middle
headings or images, so we need

00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:18.366 A:middle
to explore and listen to

00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:20.546 A:middle
headings and images, tabs and

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:21.886 A:middle
buttons, and make sure we're

00:16:21.886 --> 00:16:23.266 A:middle
honoring that experience.

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:28.756 A:middle
Now to demonstrate these initial

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.776 A:middle
gestures, here's Ryan Dour.

00:16:31.756 --> 00:16:32.756 A:middle
Cool. Thanks James.

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:35.016 A:middle
So we're still here in our

00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:36.746 A:middle
weather app, and I would

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.936 A:middle
actually like to go back to the

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:39.366 A:middle
home screen.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.936 A:middle
This is an iPhone X, so in order

00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:42.396 A:middle
to do that, I need to use our

00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:44.396 A:middle
new home gesture, and that is

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:45.876 A:middle
going to be again, touching my

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:47.606 A:middle
finger at the bottom in the home

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:48.926 A:middle
[inaudible], and then sliding my

00:16:48.926 --> 00:16:50.356 A:middle
finger up until I feel that

00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:51.786 A:middle
first vibration to go home.

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:53.976 A:middle
VoiceOver will also tell me, if

00:16:53.976 --> 00:16:55.046 A:middle
I haven't let go of the screen

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:56.936 A:middle
yet, that this is exactly what

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:58.476 A:middle
I'm going to do if I let go.

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
Let's go ahead and check that
