00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:00.216 A:middle
thing off with asking you a very

00:22:00.216 --> 00:22:01.946 A:middle
important question, which is, is

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.116 A:middle
your app easy enough to use with

00:22:04.116 --> 00:22:04.996 A:middle
your eyes closed?

00:22:05.756 --> 00:22:07.676 A:middle
And I'm going to guess that for

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:08.726 A:middle
a lot of you, you might say,

00:22:08.726 --> 00:22:10.176 A:middle
geez, I have no idea.

00:22:10.926 --> 00:22:14.356 A:middle
I'm going to find out, but for

00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:16.476 A:middle
me that is my experience.

00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:17.896 A:middle
I don't get to see your app.

00:22:17.896 --> 00:22:19.206 A:middle
I cants see your app.

00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:21.176 A:middle
So for me I really need that

00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:22.656 A:middle
question to actually be the most

00:22:22.656 --> 00:22:24.026 A:middle
serious one you ask yourself.

00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:27.346 A:middle
Now, keeping your eyes closed is

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.036 A:middle
a challenge.

00:22:28.136 --> 00:22:29.446 A:middle
It's very difficult to keep it

00:22:29.446 --> 00:22:31.046 A:middle
up, and also you might want to

00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:31.906 A:middle
be looking at your computer,

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:32.986 A:middle
taking notes, and doing other

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:33.266 A:middle
things.

00:22:34.016 --> 00:22:35.746 A:middle
So in order to do this, the most

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:37.636 A:middle
effective way I know possible, I

00:22:37.636 --> 00:22:39.336 A:middle
encourage you to use the screen

00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:39.726 A:middle
curtain.

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.036 A:middle
The screen curtain blacks out

00:22:42.036 --> 00:22:44.656 A:middle
your entire screen and puts you

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:45.506 A:middle
in my shoes.

00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:47.726 A:middle
You have a chance to use your

00:22:47.726 --> 00:22:49.756 A:middle
app the way I use it entirely,

00:22:50.296 --> 00:22:51.476 A:middle
and there's no cheating here.

00:22:51.806 --> 00:22:53.266 A:middle
That is the only interface

00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:54.066 A:middle
you're going to get.

00:22:54.366 --> 00:22:55.176 A:middle
Let's turn it on.

00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.436 A:middle
So three-finger triple tap.

00:22:57.806 --> 00:22:59.466 A:middle
Again, three fingers, three

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:00.096 A:middle
times.
