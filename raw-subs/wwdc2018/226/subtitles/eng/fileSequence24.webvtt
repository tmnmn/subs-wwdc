00:23:57.576 --> 00:24:00.316 A:middle
through, both enjoy and make

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.076 A:middle
sure that it's completely

00:24:02.286 --> 00:24:03.906 A:middle
amazing, then so can I.

00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:06.826 A:middle
I can enjoy your app in full if

00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:08.226 A:middle
you take this through as the

00:24:08.226 --> 00:24:09.856 A:middle
final step before you call it

00:24:09.856 --> 00:24:10.136 A:middle
done.

00:24:10.536 --> 00:24:10.896 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:24:18.116 --> 00:24:18.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Ryan.

00:24:19.156 --> 00:24:21.616 A:middle
So now it's time to talk about

00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:23.026 A:middle
how VoiceOver can benefit your

00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:23.236 A:middle
app.

00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:25.766 A:middle
Because you're ready.

00:24:27.016 --> 00:24:29.786 A:middle
Today you can leave this area

00:24:29.786 --> 00:24:32.636 A:middle
and go and test your app, and I

00:24:32.636 --> 00:24:34.216 A:middle
would encourage you to test it

00:24:34.216 --> 00:24:35.326 A:middle
like you normally would just

00:24:35.326 --> 00:24:36.236 A:middle
with VoiceOver on.

00:24:37.246 --> 00:24:38.356 A:middle
But I want you to pay attention

00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:39.796 A:middle
to these additional insights

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.366 A:middle
that could make your app better

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:43.856 A:middle
for all users.

00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:48.336 A:middle
So one, if something doesn't

00:24:48.336 --> 00:24:50.346 A:middle
sound right, it may not read

00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:51.046 A:middle
right either.

00:24:52.526 --> 00:24:54.696 A:middle
It's like when a writer reads

00:24:54.696 --> 00:24:56.306 A:middle
something aloud that they wrote.

00:24:57.356 --> 00:24:58.406 A:middle
It's just another way to check

00:24:58.406 --> 00:24:59.476 A:middle
that your message is coming

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:01.266 A:middle
through, and it doesn't just
