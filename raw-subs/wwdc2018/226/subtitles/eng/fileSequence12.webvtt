00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.176 A:middle
everywhere I go while I'm using

00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:02.276 A:middle
VoiceOver, and there's really

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:03.366 A:middle
several different ways that we

00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:04.606 A:middle
can move the VoiceOver cursor

00:12:04.606 --> 00:12:04.876 A:middle
around.

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:06.046 A:middle
The first is that I can reach

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:07.096 A:middle
out and touch just about

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.566 A:middle
anything on the screen, and the

00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:09.876 A:middle
VoiceOver cursor is going to

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:11.376 A:middle
follow along, and it's also

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:12.426 A:middle
going to speak that item.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:13.346 A:middle
So if I just reach out and

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:13.606 A:middle
touch--

00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:14.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Reminders.

00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:16.596 A:middle
One task due today.

00:12:17.356 --> 00:12:17.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:20.676 A:middle
I can also just drag my finger

00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:21.816 A:middle
around the screen to move that

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.016 A:middle
VoiceOver cursor, and it's going

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:25.756 A:middle
to follow along, so I'll try

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:26.186 A:middle
that.

00:12:26.186 --> 00:12:26.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No mail [inaudible] maps,

00:12:26.986 --> 00:12:27.436 A:middle
weather.

00:12:27.856 --> 00:12:29.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We also have flick

00:12:29.326 --> 00:12:29.946 A:middle
navigation.

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:31.166 A:middle
If I flick left.

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:32.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Maps.

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I move back an item.

00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:34.636 A:middle
If I flick right.

00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:35.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Weather.

00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:36.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I move right an item.

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:37.666 A:middle
And this reads left to right,

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:38.466 A:middle
top to bottom.

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:39.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Notes.

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:40.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; See how it wrapped to the

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:41.596 A:middle
next line there?

00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:44.276 A:middle
So from here I can actually go

00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:46.436 A:middle
ahead and if I want flick my way

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:47.626 A:middle
to an app and launch it.

00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Remind, news, stocks, TV,

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:51.816 A:middle
stocks, weather.

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:52.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Or I can find it this way,

00:12:53.016 --> 00:12:54.246 A:middle
and I can double tap.

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Cupertino.

00:12:56.496 --> 00:12:57.366 A:middle
Cupertino.

00:12:57.626 --> 00:12:59.596 A:middle
No weather info-- San Jose,

00:12:59.596 --> 00:12:59.956 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:00.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There we go, that's the right
