Well, supporting VoiceOver makes

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.426 A:middle
your app more inclusive.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.216 A:middle
VoiceOver users are more likely

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:11.226 A:middle
to choose you app over other

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:12.686 A:middle
apps that don't support

00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:13.166 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.716 A:middle
And this is a great community,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.866 A:middle
so they are more likely to in

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.276 A:middle
turn recommend your app to other

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:21.346 A:middle
VoiceOver users.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:26.286 A:middle
But sadly, for many developers,

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.606 A:middle
those reasons are not enough,

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:30.516 A:middle
and I get it.

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:32.196 A:middle
There's only so much time.

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:33.906 A:middle
There's only so many resources,

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.386 A:middle
and you want to make the best

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:37.756 A:middle
decisions to create the best

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:38.816 A:middle
experience for the most of your

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:39.356 A:middle
users.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:42.446 A:middle
So that's why it's so important

00:03:42.446 --> 00:03:44.956 A:middle
today that you realize that

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.476 A:middle
learning VoiceOver can help make

00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:49.086 A:middle
your app more usable for

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:50.616 A:middle
everyone, not just VoiceOver

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.856 A:middle
users, for all users.

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:55.986 A:middle
So I bet you're asking yourself,

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:56.196 A:middle
right?

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:57.966 A:middle
Can a screen reader do that?

00:03:58.726 --> 00:03:59.926 A:middle
Yeah, absolutely.
