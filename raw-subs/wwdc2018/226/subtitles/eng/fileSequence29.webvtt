00:28:58.456 --> 00:29:00.716 A:middle
confirm that experience, because

00:29:00.716 --> 00:29:02.716 A:middle
if you've ever wondered what a

00:29:02.716 --> 00:29:04.406 A:middle
VoiceOver experience should be,

00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:07.586 A:middle
just remember, the goal is just

00:29:07.586 --> 00:29:09.396 A:middle
to match the experience everyone

00:29:09.396 --> 00:29:09.876 A:middle
else gets.

00:29:10.796 --> 00:29:13.346 A:middle
So compare the two and improve

00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:15.446 A:middle
both based on what you learn.

00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:20.526 A:middle
And then make VoiceOver a part

00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:21.746 A:middle
of your regular testing.

00:29:22.476 --> 00:29:23.636 A:middle
Talk to your team.

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:26.186 A:middle
Make VoiceOver a part of your

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:27.866 A:middle
practice, not just so that you

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.156 A:middle
can continue to improve your

00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:32.026 A:middle
experience with every release,

00:29:32.656 --> 00:29:34.646 A:middle
but also to avoid losing the

00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:37.196 A:middle
lessons that we gained here

00:29:38.536 --> 00:29:38.666 A:middle
today.

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:40.956 A:middle
And lastly, go out there and

00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:43.096 A:middle
teach others what you know

00:29:44.206 --> 00:29:45.246 A:middle
because that's why I'm here

00:29:45.246 --> 00:29:47.546 A:middle
today, because teaching is the

00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:49.416 A:middle
best way I know how to master

00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:50.176 A:middle
any subject.

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:55.176 A:middle
Now helping you become a master,

00:29:55.596 --> 00:29:56.716 A:middle
I also want to share these

00:29:56.716 --> 00:29:57.546 A:middle
resources.
