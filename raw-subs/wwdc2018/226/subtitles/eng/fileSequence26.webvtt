00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:01.226 A:middle
Are you guys ready?

00:26:01.746 --> 00:26:02.716 A:middle
Come on, do you remember how?

00:26:02.716 --> 00:26:05.036 A:middle
All right, let's review then,

00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:05.366 A:middle
all right.

00:26:05.366 --> 00:26:07.586 A:middle
So inside of settings, we're

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:08.326 A:middle
going to go to general.

00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:10.146 A:middle
If you have an iOS device, feel

00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:12.776 A:middle
free to take it out.

00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:14.376 A:middle
Inside of general is

00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:15.306 A:middle
accessibility.

00:26:19.296 --> 00:26:21.416 A:middle
Accessibility, we're going to

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:22.896 A:middle
ignore the very top of the

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:25.186 A:middle
screen, and we're going to go

00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:26.236 A:middle
all the way to the bottom.

00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:28.876 A:middle
If we can enable today the

00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:31.236 A:middle
accessibility shortcut, not only

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:32.086 A:middle
are we going to have a chance to

00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:33.386 A:middle
turn on VoiceOver, potentially

00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:34.646 A:middle
for the very first time, but

00:26:35.256 --> 00:26:36.696 A:middle
it's also a quick way to go back

00:26:36.696 --> 00:26:38.566 A:middle
and turn it on again, back to

00:26:38.566 --> 00:26:39.626 A:middle
show your colleagues.

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:41.426 A:middle
Turn it on again when you go

00:26:41.426 --> 00:26:43.766 A:middle
back to your office or maybe

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:44.456 A:middle
when you're trying to make a

00:26:44.456 --> 00:26:46.926 A:middle
case for trying to give more

00:26:46.926 --> 00:26:49.036 A:middle
resource time to focus on

00:26:49.036 --> 00:26:49.626 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:26:51.206 --> 00:26:54.086 A:middle
So, if we've gone into settings,

00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:56.946 A:middle
general, accessibility, and gone

00:26:56.996 --> 00:26:59.356 A:middle
into the accessibility shortcut

00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.706 A:middle
and checked VoiceOver, now we'll
