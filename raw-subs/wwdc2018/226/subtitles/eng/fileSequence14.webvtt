00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:02.976 A:middle
So here's how we do that.

00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:05.386 A:middle
Now if I needed to go home,

00:14:05.876 --> 00:14:06.826 A:middle
well, I could press the home

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:07.136 A:middle
button.

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:09.536 A:middle
But on a new device, like iPhone

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:12.596 A:middle
X, we need to go home by taking

00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:14.006 A:middle
our finger from the very bottom

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:15.856 A:middle
edge of your device and starting

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:16.516 A:middle
to slide it up.

00:14:17.246 --> 00:14:19.836 A:middle
The first vibration I feel will

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:22.236 A:middle
go home, and if I keep dragging

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.076 A:middle
up, the second vibration I feel

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:25.506 A:middle
will open the app switcher.

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:27.596 A:middle
I can also repeat this gesture

00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:29.016 A:middle
from the very top edge of my

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:31.426 A:middle
display and open things like the

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.536 A:middle
Navigation Center and the

00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:34.236 A:middle
Control Center.

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:39.116 A:middle
And when you're not testing your

00:14:39.116 --> 00:14:41.786 A:middle
app, you can three-finger flick.

00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:43.176 A:middle
It's basically the same as a

00:14:43.176 --> 00:14:45.226 A:middle
one-finger flick to allow me to

00:14:45.226 --> 00:14:48.276 A:middle
scroll or move between my home

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:48.696 A:middle
screens.

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:50.776 A:middle
But in this case, I'm using

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:51.486 A:middle
three fingers.

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.356 A:middle
So using three fingers back and

00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:55.736 A:middle
forth, up and down, will allow

00:14:55.736 --> 00:14:57.046 A:middle
me to get to those areas.

00:14:57.386 --> 00:14:58.306 A:middle
So whether or not you're

00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
exploring other apps or going
