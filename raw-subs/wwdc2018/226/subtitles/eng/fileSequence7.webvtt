00:06:55.046 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
before my presentation is done.

00:07:00.906 --> 00:07:02.116 A:middle
So how do we turn on VoiceOver?

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.926 A:middle
Well, it starts in settings, and

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:04.596 A:middle
we go to general.

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:07.576 A:middle
In general, I can open up the

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:08.506 A:middle
accessibility menu.

00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:10.396 A:middle
It's a great list of all the

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.136 A:middle
features that we include on our

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:14.296 A:middle
iOS devices so that we can have

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:15.756 A:middle
equal access to our users.

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.726 A:middle
And VoiceOver is right at the

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:22.476 A:middle
top of that list, but I

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:23.786 A:middle
discourage you from opening it

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
there.

00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:26.116 A:middle
I discourage you from going in

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:27.916 A:middle
and enabling VoiceOver because,

00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:29.906 A:middle
again, we might not know enough

00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:31.266 A:middle
about VoiceOver to turn it back

00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:31.676 A:middle
off.

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:34.016 A:middle
So when I teach people how to

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.116 A:middle
use VoiceOver for the first

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:37.916 A:middle
time, I encourage you to go to

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
the bottom of this list to the

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:41.316 A:middle
accessibility shortcut.

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:45.866 A:middle
It's here inside of a list of

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:46.406 A:middle
options.

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:49.206 A:middle
If I just check VoiceOver, that

00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:50.096 A:middle
means I can easily turn

00:07:50.096 --> 00:07:51.866 A:middle
VoiceOver on when I want to test

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:54.856 A:middle
it and also turn VoiceOver back

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:56.406 A:middle
off when I'm not ready to test

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:58.966 A:middle
it or my phone goes to sleep or

00:07:58.966 --> 00:07:59.656 A:middle
I get a phone.
