[VoiceOver users.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=200) [But sadly, for many

the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=250) [same is true with VoiceOver.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=253) [So here's how VoiceOver could](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=255) [help you with your app.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=258) [Well, testing with VoiceOver can](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=261) [give you a new perspective.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=263) [Now it's easy to take for](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=265) [granted your app because it's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=267) [your app.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=269) [You know exactly what it does,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=270) [what it's supposed to do, how](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=271) [it's supposed to do it.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=272) [But we take a lot of those](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=275) [things for granted, and when I](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=276) [say testing with VoiceOver gives](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=278) [you a new perspective, it's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=280) [getting a chance to experience](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=283) [your app in a new way.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=284) [That's because VoiceOver goes](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=286) [beyond the way your app location](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=289) [looks.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=291) [I mean an app might look good,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=292) [but that doesn't make it usable.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=294) [So side-scrolling states, hover](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=296) [So side-scrolling states, hover](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=296) [states, they can all give the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=300) [allusion of

interface.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=304) [But testing with VoiceOver goes](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=307) [beyond that, and so it allows](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=308) [you to discover new challenges](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=311) [and insights, and finally, I](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=313) [believe VoiceOver gets really at](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=318) [the heart of what we do.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=319) [As iOS developers, we

[apps.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=328) [Well those values are

VoiceOver.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=333) [So my question to you today is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=336) [your app so easy to use you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=339) [could

[three fingers.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/226/?time=890) [So using three fingers back
