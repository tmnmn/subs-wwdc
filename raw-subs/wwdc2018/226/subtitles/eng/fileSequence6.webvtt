00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.796 A:middle
question is to start testing

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:04.216 A:middle
with VoiceOver, and that's what

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:04.996 A:middle
I'm here for today.

00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:07.596 A:middle
I'm going to give you some ways

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:08.906 A:middle
of being able to turn on

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:10.096 A:middle
VoiceOver and start using it.

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:11.626 A:middle
Figure out where you're at,

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.376 A:middle
where you could improve, and

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:15.486 A:middle
then I'll give you some things

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:17.706 A:middle
else to watch out for that might

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:20.176 A:middle
not only improve your VoiceOver

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:23.756 A:middle
experience but possibly the

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:25.296 A:middle
experience that all users get.

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:28.476 A:middle
And here's where we're going to

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:29.206 A:middle
start.

00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:30.836 A:middle
We need to know how to use

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:31.456 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:34.296 A:middle
Now in the next slide, I'm going

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:35.136 A:middle
to show you how to enable

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:36.046 A:middle
VoiceOver in settings.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.486 A:middle
What I don't cover in the next

00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:40.056 A:middle
slide is how to navigate with

00:06:40.056 --> 00:06:41.666 A:middle
VoiceOver, activate with

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.936 A:middle
VoiceOver, heck even turn

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:44.916 A:middle
VoiceOver off using VoiceOver.

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.696 A:middle
So if you're following along out

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:47.846 A:middle
there on your iOS device, you

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:50.166 A:middle
may want to wait.

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:53.056 A:middle
But I promise you, everyone in

00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:53.886 A:middle
this room is going to have a

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
chance to turn on VoiceOver

00:06:55.046 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
before my presentation is done.
