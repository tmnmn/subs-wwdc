00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.456 A:middle
Let's go ahead and check that

00:17:00.926 --> 00:17:01.096 A:middle
out.

00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:03.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Lift for home.

00:17:03.316 --> 00:17:04.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to do that.

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:05.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Weather.

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're back on the

00:17:07.296 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
home screen.

00:17:09.026 --> 00:17:10.435 A:middle
Many of us have many pages of

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:11.925 A:middle
apps, so in order to switch

00:17:11.925 --> 00:17:13.455 A:middle
between those with VoiceOver, we

00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:15.146 A:middle
use a three-finger swipe.

00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:16.205 A:middle
Actually it's a three-finger

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.276 A:middle
flick, but, yeah, it's funny, we

00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
actually interchange that a lot

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:20.986 A:middle
here at Apple.

00:17:20.986 --> 00:17:22.675 A:middle
We say three-finger swipe or

00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:24.736 A:middle
three-finger flick, but they're

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.326 A:middle
interchangeable.

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:26.226 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and

00:17:26.356 --> 00:17:28.956 A:middle
three-finger swipe left.

00:17:28.956 --> 00:17:29.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Page three of three.

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:30.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There we go.

00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:31.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Utilities folder.

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:32.496 A:middle
Four apps.

00:17:32.576 --> 00:17:33.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:34.946 A:middle
double tap on this utilities

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:38.356 A:middle
folder so that we can explore

00:17:38.356 --> 00:17:38.916 A:middle
the inside.

00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:40.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Utilities, heading.

00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:41.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's explore.

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:42.926 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and flick

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:43.596 A:middle
right.

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Voice memo, compass, measure,

00:17:45.676 --> 00:17:47.416 A:middle
calculate, calculator.

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:48.676 A:middle
Hear that bonk?

00:17:48.756 --> 00:17:49.576 A:middle
I've reached the end.

00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:50.886 A:middle
If I flick left--

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:52.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Measure, compass, voice,

00:17:52.336 --> 00:17:54.636 A:middle
utilities, heading.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:56.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of apps

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:57.976 A:middle
and a great heading here.

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:00.026 A:middle
However, there's no apparent way
