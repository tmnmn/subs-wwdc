00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
exploring other apps or going

00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:01.506 A:middle
into Control Center or

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:03.126 A:middle
Notification Center, these areas

00:15:03.126 --> 00:15:06.076 A:middle
are full of complex UI that's

00:15:06.076 --> 00:15:07.626 A:middle
waiting to teach you the

00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:09.716 A:middle
expected results when we focus

00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:14.266 A:middle
the VoiceOver cursor on them.

00:15:14.946 --> 00:15:16.746 A:middle
Now another gesture you may need

00:15:16.986 --> 00:15:18.316 A:middle
is called the two-finger scrub,

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:20.066 A:middle
and that's where I take that

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:22.586 A:middle
same two-finger tap from before,

00:15:23.146 --> 00:15:24.756 A:middle
but instead of letting go, I

00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:25.806 A:middle
scrub back and forth very

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:27.486 A:middle
quickly, almost like in a fast Z

00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:29.606 A:middle
pattern, and that will allow me

00:15:29.606 --> 00:15:32.296 A:middle
to get out of a window without

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:33.806 A:middle
having to navigate back to

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.826 A:middle
cancel buttons or back buttons.

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:37.956 A:middle
Or in the case of UI, where they

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:39.446 A:middle
don't even have close buttons,

00:15:39.796 --> 00:15:41.856 A:middle
to quickly scrub back and forth

00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:43.356 A:middle
and dismiss the window.

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:47.436 A:middle
So while we're busy navigating

00:15:47.436 --> 00:15:49.266 A:middle
and exploring and learning about

00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:52.486 A:middle
this great expected behavior, we

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:53.456 A:middle
also kind of need to know what

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:54.236 A:middle
we're listening for.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:58.166 A:middle
So when you open a newspaper,

00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.196 A:middle
you receive a lot more visual
