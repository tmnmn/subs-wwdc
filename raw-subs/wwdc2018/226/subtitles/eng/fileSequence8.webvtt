00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.646 A:middle
So just checking VoiceOver in

00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:05.026 A:middle
this box I can turn it on by

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.326 A:middle
triple clicking the home button.

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:07.296 A:middle
Click, click, click.

00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:09.156 A:middle
And if you have a brand new

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.576 A:middle
device that doesn't have a home

00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:11.966 A:middle
button, well then you'd use the

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:14.226 A:middle
side button, click, click,

00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:16.376 A:middle
click.

00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:18.866 A:middle
When VoiceOver is enabled, we

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.186 A:middle
see the VoiceOver cursor.

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.586 A:middle
It's a visual reinforcement of

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:24.306 A:middle
what VoiceOver is trying to

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:26.316 A:middle
describe, and that's the first

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.406 A:middle
objective when testing

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.366 A:middle
VoiceOver, is to make sure that

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:32.645 A:middle
these descriptions are accurate

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.275 A:middle
and complete.

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:35.556 A:middle
And the only way you're going to

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:37.596 A:middle
test every single element inside

00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:40.515 A:middle
of your app is to navigate with

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:42.966 A:middle
VoiceOver, and here's how to do

00:08:44.046 --> 00:08:44.116 A:middle
it.

00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:45.696 A:middle
Navigating can be as easy as

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:46.816 A:middle
just reaching out and touching

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:47.276 A:middle
the screen.

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:49.306 A:middle
Dragging your finger across the

00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:50.866 A:middle
screen, VoiceOver will just read

00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:52.306 A:middle
whatever is under your finger.

00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:57.506 A:middle
But that's actually not really

00:08:57.506 --> 00:09:00.156 A:middle
how a lot of people review their
