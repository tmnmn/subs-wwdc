00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:01.496 A:middle
include headings in our apps.

00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:03.666 A:middle
So when your app doesn't support

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:06.226 A:middle
one of these rotor options, well

00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:07.616 A:middle
then we're kind of taking a tool

00:20:07.616 --> 00:20:09.666 A:middle
out of that user's toolbox to

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:11.156 A:middle
have a great experience in their

00:20:11.776 --> 00:20:11.846 A:middle
app.

00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:15.436 A:middle
So I invite you to go back into

00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:17.026 A:middle
settings, general,

00:20:17.026 --> 00:20:17.916 A:middle
accessibility.

00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:19.766 A:middle
Inside of the VoiceOver menu is

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:20.886 A:middle
a lot of great settings that

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.706 A:middle
VoiceOver users customize, and

00:20:22.706 --> 00:20:24.476 A:middle
one of them is the Rotor

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:25.066 A:middle
settings.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:27.506 A:middle
So review what we can support

00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:29.286 A:middle
and make sure that we are

00:20:29.286 --> 00:20:32.276 A:middle
honoring those in our apps.

00:20:32.516 --> 00:20:33.736 A:middle
So here's Ryan Dour to

00:20:33.736 --> 00:20:35.336 A:middle
demonstrate how the Rotor works.

00:20:35.976 --> 00:20:36.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Cook, thanks James.

00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:39.746 A:middle
So again we're back here on the

00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:40.636 A:middle
home screen.

00:20:40.636 --> 00:20:42.016 A:middle
We're on our second page of

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:44.126 A:middle
apps, and I'm going to open the

00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:44.606 A:middle
App Store.

00:20:44.606 --> 00:20:45.556 A:middle
So I'm going to flick once,

00:20:45.556 --> 00:20:45.816 A:middle
right.

00:20:46.096 --> 00:20:46.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; App Store.

00:20:46.806 --> 00:20:47.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; There it is.

00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:49.076 A:middle
Image going to double tap again

00:20:49.076 --> 00:20:50.246 A:middle
to activate.

00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:51.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Apps, heading.

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So I'm on the apps tab of the

00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:54.426 A:middle
App Store.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:55.886 A:middle
There are an awful lot of

00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:57.306 A:middle
fantastic apps here.

00:20:57.916 --> 00:20:59.386 A:middle
However, I don't want to have to

00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:00.736 A:middle
explore each and every one of
