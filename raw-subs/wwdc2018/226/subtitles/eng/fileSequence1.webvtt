00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:03.286 A:middle
benefits your app.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:06.626 A:middle
So what is VoiceOver?

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.796 A:middle
I get some common answers like

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.006 A:middle
well VoiceOver is a screen

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:12.296 A:middle
reader.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.906 A:middle
That's true, but VoiceOver

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:17.716 A:middle
doesn't just read the screen, or

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.236 A:middle
VoiceOver is for the visually

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:20.676 A:middle
impaired.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:24.756 A:middle
It's true, but it's not just for

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:25.566 A:middle
the visually impaired.

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:32.226 A:middle
So if VoiceOver is not just for

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.426 A:middle
the visually impaired, and it's

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.646 A:middle
not just a screen reader, what

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.246 A:middle
is it?

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:40.926 A:middle
VoiceOver is an alternative way

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.826 A:middle
of using you app, and it uses

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:46.156 A:middle
gestures, a keyboard, or a

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.446 A:middle
Braille display to give a

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:51.196 A:middle
variety of users equal access to

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:54.016 A:middle
your experience, and it's built

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:56.276 A:middle
in to every Apple device.

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:59.796 A:middle
Now think about that last point.
