00:08:57.506 --> 00:09:00.156 A:middle
how a lot of people review their

00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:00.506 A:middle
apps.

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:02.766 A:middle
I start at the top.

00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:04.116 A:middle
I work through everything in

00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:05.346 A:middle
read order to the very end.

00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:08.446 A:middle
VoiceOver users accomplish using

00:09:08.446 --> 00:09:10.626 A:middle
flick navigation, and that's

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:11.606 A:middle
taking my finger and putting it

00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:13.166 A:middle
on the screen and then flicking

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:14.536 A:middle
to the right, flicking to the

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:14.766 A:middle
right.

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:16.746 A:middle
Now if I went slow enough, it

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:17.846 A:middle
would just read under my finger,

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:19.506 A:middle
so you have to really give it a

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:21.306 A:middle
quick flick until your finger

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:22.306 A:middle
flies off the screen.

00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:24.316 A:middle
And conversely, I could go back

00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:26.346 A:middle
to the left, and I could go to

00:09:26.346 --> 00:09:27.766 A:middle
the previous item or the next

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:28.166 A:middle
item.

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:31.886 A:middle
And it's important that you also

00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:33.236 A:middle
want to keep in mind the

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:34.766 A:middle
starting position of your

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:37.066 A:middle
VoiceOver cursor, because if

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:37.906 A:middle
will start in the middle of your

00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:38.456 A:middle
page.

00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:41.456 A:middle
Well, that would assume as a

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.326 A:middle
user that there isn't anything

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:45.366 A:middle
before it, and so you might be

00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:47.786 A:middle
leaving your users without all

00:09:48.376 --> 00:09:48.876 A:middle
the story.

00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:53.236 A:middle
So, we have two ways to

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:56.196 A:middle
navigate, and we have no way to

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:57.756 A:middle
control how a user navigates.

00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:00.016 A:middle
So you want to test both these
