00:18:59.436 --> 00:19:02.616 A:middle
And the Rotor is a VoiceOver

00:19:02.616 --> 00:19:04.426 A:middle
feature that dynamically

00:19:04.426 --> 00:19:06.356 A:middle
presents options that the user

00:19:06.356 --> 00:19:08.836 A:middle
can adjust or navigate by.

00:19:10.996 --> 00:19:14.156 A:middle
A VoiceOver user can set the

00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:17.096 A:middle
Rotor by making two fingers on

00:19:17.096 --> 00:19:19.226 A:middle
the screen and turning it around

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:20.616 A:middle
a center point, almost like

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:22.206 A:middle
you're turning an invisible knob

00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:22.996 A:middle
on screen.

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.896 A:middle
And as we adjust the rotor,

00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:27.806 A:middle
it'll speak all the options that

00:19:27.806 --> 00:19:29.376 A:middle
are supported within the view

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.266 A:middle
that we're focused in.

00:19:30.826 --> 00:19:33.566 A:middle
So in this case, we could turn

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:35.176 A:middle
that rotor and switch it to

00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:37.686 A:middle
headings, and once it's set to

00:19:37.686 --> 00:19:39.856 A:middle
headings, I'd be able to go to

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:41.286 A:middle
the next heading by taking a

00:19:41.286 --> 00:19:43.056 A:middle
single finger and flicking down.

00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:45.706 A:middle
Or, conversely, I could flick up

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:47.496 A:middle
with one finger, and that would

00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:48.596 A:middle
go to the previous heading.

00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:53.146 A:middle
And here's why the Rotor matters

00:19:53.146 --> 00:19:54.436 A:middle
to you as a developer.

00:19:55.506 --> 00:19:58.166 A:middle
Because a Rotor only works if we

00:19:58.166 --> 00:19:59.906 A:middle
as developers remember to

00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:01.496 A:middle
include headings in our apps.
