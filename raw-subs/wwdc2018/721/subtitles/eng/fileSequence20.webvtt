00:19:59.086 --> 00:20:01.206 A:middle
setup, avoid redoing the setup

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:02.676 A:middle
in the view load method of your

00:20:02.676 --> 00:20:04.016 A:middle
view controller, and tearing it

00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:04.596 A:middle
down later.

00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:06.836 A:middle
The system may reuse your app

00:20:06.836 --> 00:20:08.446 A:middle
extensions process if the user

00:20:08.446 --> 00:20:09.806 A:middle
sequentially signs into multiple

00:20:09.806 --> 00:20:11.386 A:middle
services using your extension.

00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:13.886 A:middle
Consider using a singleton

00:20:13.886 --> 00:20:15.766 A:middle
pattern, so any work done in one

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:17.596 A:middle
invocation of your extension can

00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:19.276 A:middle
be reused the next time if it

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:20.296 A:middle
doesn't need to be repeated.

00:20:20.836 --> 00:20:24.836 A:middle
And that wraps up how you can

00:20:24.836 --> 00:20:26.096 A:middle
display credentials from your

00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:29.206 A:middle
app in the QuickType bar.

00:20:29.376 --> 00:20:31.056 A:middle
Finally, I'll discuss one more

00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:32.726 A:middle
API your extension may find

00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:33.056 A:middle
useful.

00:20:34.106 --> 00:20:35.426 A:middle
When the user enables your app

00:20:35.426 --> 00:20:37.006 A:middle
extension for Password AutoFill,

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.296 A:middle
you may have some setup that

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:39.796 A:middle
needs to be done before the user

00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:41.096 A:middle
can get the best experience.

00:20:41.676 --> 00:20:43.186 A:middle
For starters, if you support

00:20:43.186 --> 00:20:44.046 A:middle
showing credentials in the

00:20:44.046 --> 00:20:45.726 A:middle
QuickType bar, your app or

00:20:45.726 --> 00:20:47.026 A:middle
extension will need to provide

00:20:47.026 --> 00:20:48.126 A:middle
its credential identities to

00:20:48.126 --> 00:20:49.086 A:middle
AutoFill first.

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:51.166 A:middle
But it may also be useful to

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.296 A:middle
show other settings at this

00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:54.226 A:middle
point, perhaps to offer the user

00:20:54.226 --> 00:20:55.416 A:middle
the ability to sign in to an

00:20:55.416 --> 00:20:56.736 A:middle
online service to retrieve the

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:58.016 A:middle
passwords if they haven't

00:20:58.016 --> 00:20:58.396 A:middle
already.
