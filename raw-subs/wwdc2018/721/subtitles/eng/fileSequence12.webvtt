00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:00.616 A:middle
Credential Identity Store to the

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.516 A:middle
Cloud or includes it in backups,

00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:04.746 A:middle
so this information never leaves

00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.000 A:middle
the device.

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.246 A:middle
Each app has its own Credential

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:11.216 A:middle
Identity Store, and only the app

00:12:11.216 --> 00:12:12.736 A:middle
and its extensions can modify

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:13.436 A:middle
it.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.336 A:middle
The store is only read by

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.246 A:middle
AutoFill for determining which

00:12:17.246 --> 00:12:19.286 A:middle
credentials to suggest to users.

00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:23.316 A:middle
And the Credential Identity

00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:25.046 A:middle
Store can only be modified while

00:12:25.046 --> 00:12:26.226 A:middle
your app's extension has been

00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.296 A:middle
enabled by the user.

00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:29.716 A:middle
If your extension is disabled,

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:31.036 A:middle
attempts to update the store

00:12:31.036 --> 00:12:31.616 A:middle
will fail.

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:33.386 A:middle
And if the user disables your

00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:34.806 A:middle
extension or deletes your app,

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:36.296 A:middle
the Credential Identity Store

00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:37.026 A:middle
will be deleted.

00:12:37.476 --> 00:12:41.276 A:middle
Your app should update its

00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:42.706 A:middle
Credential Identity Store when

00:12:42.706 --> 00:12:43.856 A:middle
it has new information about

00:12:43.856 --> 00:12:45.076 A:middle
what credentials it can offer.

00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:47.896 A:middle
As an example, let's say your

00:12:47.896 --> 00:12:49.616 A:middle
app uses an online service to

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:50.916 A:middle
store the user's credentials.

00:12:51.456 --> 00:12:54.156 A:middle
When the user signs in, your app

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:55.006 A:middle
would start retrieving the

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:56.026 A:middle
user's credentials.

00:12:56.486 --> 00:12:58.356 A:middle
At this time, you would update

00:12:58.356 --> 00:12:59.186 A:middle
the list of credential

00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:00.796 A:middle
identities in the store, so the
