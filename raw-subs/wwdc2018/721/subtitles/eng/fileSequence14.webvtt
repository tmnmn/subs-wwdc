00:13:59.116 --> 00:14:00.516 A:middle
list of credential identities

00:14:00.516 --> 00:14:01.676 A:middle
that AutoFill will consider

00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:02.246 A:middle
suggesting.

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:06.026 A:middle
When individual changes are

00:14:06.026 --> 00:14:07.826 A:middle
made, these saved credential

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:09.496 A:middle
identities or removed credential

00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:11.666 A:middle
identities methods allow you to

00:14:11.666 --> 00:14:13.846 A:middle
add, update or remove credential

00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:15.386 A:middle
identities without completely

00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:16.596 A:middle
replacing the contents of the

00:14:16.596 --> 00:14:16.906 A:middle
store.

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:21.486 A:middle
One important aspect of the

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.426 A:middle
system to understand is that the

00:14:23.426 --> 00:14:25.036 A:middle
Credential Identity Store may be

00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:26.506 A:middle
deleted at times that your app

00:14:26.506 --> 00:14:27.516 A:middle
won't be able to predict.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.276 A:middle
As a few examples, if the user

00:14:31.276 --> 00:14:32.596 A:middle
disables your extension for

00:14:32.596 --> 00:14:34.336 A:middle
AutoFill, then later re-enables

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:36.026 A:middle
it, the system will have cleared

00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:36.386 A:middle
the store.

00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:38.696 A:middle
If the system determines that

00:14:38.696 --> 00:14:39.996 A:middle
your app provides credential

00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:41.546 A:middle
identities, but consistently

00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:43.076 A:middle
fails to provide the passwords

00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:44.276 A:middle
when the user selects these

00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:46.076 A:middle
credentials, the credential

00:14:46.076 --> 00:14:47.976 A:middle
identity store may be deleted to

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:49.116 A:middle
prevent the user from seeing

00:14:49.116 --> 00:14:49.926 A:middle
these stale credential

00:14:49.926 --> 00:14:50.646 A:middle
suggestions.

00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:54.756 A:middle
If the user restores their

00:14:54.756 --> 00:14:56.176 A:middle
device from a backup where they

00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:57.116 A:middle
were using your credential

00:14:57.116 --> 00:14:59.056 A:middle
provider extension, the store

00:14:59.056 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
won't contain any credential
