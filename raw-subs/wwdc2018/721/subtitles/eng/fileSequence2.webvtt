00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.036 A:middle
password manager.

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.146 A:middle
This UI is provided by an

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:03.296 A:middle
extension bundled with the

00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:04.146 A:middle
password manager app.

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:06.656 A:middle
When a credential is selected,

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:07.986 A:middle
the extension hands it back to

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:10.515 A:middle
AutoFill, and the username and

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:11.686 A:middle
password are filled in the app.

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.126 A:middle
Of course, this also works with

00:02:15.126 --> 00:02:16.356 A:middle
the QuickType bar suggestions as

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:16.626 A:middle
well.

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:18.386 A:middle
AutoFill can now surface the

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:19.796 A:middle
best credentials as defined by

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:21.396 A:middle
the app, so they're accessible

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:22.416 A:middle
with just one tap.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:25.486 A:middle
When using these credentials,

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.016 A:middle
the app extension can optionally

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.596 A:middle
show its own UI to authenticate

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:29.666 A:middle
the user before filling the

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:30.106 A:middle
credential.

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.796 A:middle
This integration makes logging

00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:36.506 A:middle
into apps even easier for users

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
of password manager apps, as

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:39.066 A:middle
they no longer need to switch

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.436 A:middle
apps to copy their credentials.

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:43.216 A:middle
It also makes Password AutoFill

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:44.426 A:middle
available in more apps.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:46.346 A:middle
Any app that supports AutoFill

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.826 A:middle
from iCloud Keychain will now

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.336 A:middle
work with Password Manager apps,

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.346 A:middle
without any additional work.

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:54.726 A:middle
With that overview, let's dive

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:55.926 A:middle
into how you can implement these

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.336 A:middle
capabilities in your password

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:57.926 A:middle
manager app.

00:02:58.576 --> 00:02:59.666 A:middle
There are four main steps I'll

00:02:59.666 --> 00:02:59.946 A:middle
cover.
