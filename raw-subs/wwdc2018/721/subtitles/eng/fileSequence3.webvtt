00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:04.006 A:middle
First, you'll need to configure

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:05.426 A:middle
your project to take advantage

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:06.536 A:middle
of some new APIs.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:08.106 A:middle
This involves adding a

00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:09.706 A:middle
capability to your app and an

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:11.006 A:middle
extension to your project.

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:13.116 A:middle
AutoFill will use this extension

00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:14.136 A:middle
when it needs to consult your

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:16.636 A:middle
app or show its UI across the

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:18.006 A:middle
system.

00:03:18.036 --> 00:03:19.566 A:middle
Next, your extension will need

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.786 A:middle
to support showing the user a

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:21.896 A:middle
list of their credentials to

00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:23.256 A:middle
choose from when they open your

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:24.346 A:middle
extension from the QuickType

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:24.536 A:middle
bar.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.626 A:middle
After that, if you want AutoFill

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:29.746 A:middle
to show your app's credentials

00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:31.226 A:middle
in the QuickType bar, you will

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:32.466 A:middle
need to add support for this by

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:33.566 A:middle
telling the system about the

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:34.656 A:middle
credentials you want to show,

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.536 A:middle
and implementing another API in

00:03:36.536 --> 00:03:37.856 A:middle
your extension to respond to

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:38.746 A:middle
users selecting those

00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:39.326 A:middle
credentials.

00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:42.236 A:middle
And finally, you may want to

00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:43.536 A:middle
take advantage of an API that

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:44.886 A:middle
will allow you to present your

00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:46.806 A:middle
extension's UI when users enable

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:47.876 A:middle
your Password Manager in

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:48.356 A:middle
Settings.

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:50.096 A:middle
Let's talk about these steps in

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:50.546 A:middle
more detail.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:54.646 A:middle
First, you will need to make a

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:55.826 A:middle
few changes to your project.

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:57.506 A:middle
This starts with enabling

00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:59.356 A:middle
AutoFill Credential Provider in

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:00.556 A:middle
your app's capabilities.
