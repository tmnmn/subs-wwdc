00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:02.466 A:middle
and second, iOS 11 brought

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.025 A:middle
password AutoFill to apps.

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:05.836 A:middle
This makes it super convenient

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:07.166 A:middle
to use credentials from iCloud

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.826 A:middle
keychain, whether they're needed

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:10.846 A:middle
on the web or in apps, like the

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:12.006 A:middle
shiny app you just saw.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:17.046 A:middle
And new in iOS and tvOS 12, you

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
can also use password AutoFill

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.306 A:middle
in Apple TV apps by selecting

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:21.716 A:middle
credentials to fill from an iOS

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:23.476 A:middle
device.

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:24.456 A:middle
These features are great for

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:26.006 A:middle
users of iCloud keychain, but

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:27.186 A:middle
some users rely on other

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.406 A:middle
password manager apps to store

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:29.116 A:middle
their credentials.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.136 A:middle
To make it just as convenient

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:33.346 A:middle
for these users to access their

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:35.736 A:middle
safe credentials, iOS 12 allows

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:37.036 A:middle
password manager apps to

00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.446 A:middle
participate in AutoFill for the

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:39.656 A:middle
same experience as iCloud

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:40.046 A:middle
Keychain.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:44.346 A:middle
In iOS 12, there is a new UI for

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:45.676 A:middle
password AutoFill settings,

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:47.476 A:middle
which allows users to select an

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:48.776 A:middle
app to provide credentials to

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:51.126 A:middle
AutoFill, in addition to or

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:52.406 A:middle
instead of iCloud Keychain.

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:56.006 A:middle
Using the QuickType bar, the

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.146 A:middle
user can bring up a list of

00:01:58.146 --> 00:01:59.266 A:middle
their credentials saved in the

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.036 A:middle
password manager.
