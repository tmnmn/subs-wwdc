00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:00.696 A:middle
Identities and Remove Credential

00:16:00.696 --> 00:16:03.386 A:middle
Identities methods.

00:16:03.386 --> 00:16:04.916 A:middle
Otherwise, if the Store hasn't

00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:06.656 A:middle
been written to yet, perhaps

00:16:06.656 --> 00:16:07.746 A:middle
because your app was just

00:16:07.786 --> 00:16:08.996 A:middle
disabled and re-enabled,

00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:11.446 A:middle
Supports Incremental Updates

00:16:11.446 --> 00:16:12.546 A:middle
will return false.

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:13.706 A:middle
And you should populate the

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.176 A:middle
Identity Store by providing the

00:16:15.176 --> 00:16:16.176 A:middle
full list of credential

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:18.046 A:middle
identities using the Replace

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
Credential Identities With

00:16:19.626 --> 00:16:19.996 A:middle
method.

00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:23.466 A:middle
Once your app starts saving

00:16:23.466 --> 00:16:24.626 A:middle
credential identities to the

00:16:24.626 --> 00:16:26.716 A:middle
store, AutoFill can start

00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:27.546 A:middle
suggesting your app's

00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:28.576 A:middle
credentials in the QuickType

00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:28.776 A:middle
bar.

00:16:29.916 --> 00:16:31.556 A:middle
Next, you'll need to add support

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:32.816 A:middle
in your extension to provide the

00:16:32.816 --> 00:16:33.976 A:middle
password when one of these

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:35.246 A:middle
credential suggestions is

00:16:35.246 --> 00:16:35.756 A:middle
selected.

00:16:37.836 --> 00:16:39.846 A:middle
When this happens, AutoFill will

00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:41.376 A:middle
first launch your extension and

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.866 A:middle
ask it for the password without

00:16:42.866 --> 00:16:44.166 A:middle
presenting your UI on screen.

00:16:44.346 --> 00:16:46.886 A:middle
When it does this, AutoFill will

00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:48.596 A:middle
call the Provide Credential

00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:50.306 A:middle
Without User Interaction For

00:16:50.536 --> 00:16:51.896 A:middle
method on your view controller,

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:53.846 A:middle
providing an AS Password

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:54.776 A:middle
Credential Identity,

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.026 A:middle
representing the credential

00:16:56.026 --> 00:16:56.526 A:middle
being filled.

00:16:57.136 --> 00:16:59.766 A:middle
In this method, you will look up

00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:00.956 A:middle
the associated password
