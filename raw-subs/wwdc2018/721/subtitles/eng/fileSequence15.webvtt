00:14:59.056 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
won't contain any credential

00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:01.736 A:middle
identities since it wasn't

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:02.596 A:middle
included in the backup.

00:15:02.596 --> 00:15:04.546 A:middle
Your app should be able to

00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:06.516 A:middle
handle these cases, and AS

00:15:06.596 --> 00:15:08.316 A:middle
Credential Identity Store can

00:15:08.316 --> 00:15:09.576 A:middle
help you detect these cases, so

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:10.726 A:middle
you can take the appropriate

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:12.006 A:middle
action when you need to update

00:15:12.006 --> 00:15:12.376 A:middle
the store.

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:17.336 A:middle
You can use the Get State method

00:15:17.446 --> 00:15:18.666 A:middle
to ask the system about the

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.006 A:middle
state of your app's Credential

00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.846 A:middle
Identity Store, return it as an

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:23.356 A:middle
AS Credential Identity Store

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:24.176 A:middle
State Object.

00:15:25.876 --> 00:15:27.566 A:middle
The first thing it tells you is

00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:28.926 A:middle
whether or not the user has your

00:15:28.926 --> 00:15:30.016 A:middle
app extension enabled.

00:15:30.726 --> 00:15:31.816 A:middle
You should check this before

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:32.686 A:middle
attempting to update the

00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:33.746 A:middle
credential identity store.

00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:35.606 A:middle
If your extension is disabled,

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:36.816 A:middle
there is no point in trying to

00:15:36.816 --> 00:15:38.136 A:middle
save or remove credential

00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:38.716 A:middle
identities.

00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:44.306 A:middle
The State also has a Supports

00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:45.606 A:middle
Incremental Updates Property,

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:47.136 A:middle
which you can use to determine

00:15:47.136 --> 00:15:48.626 A:middle
if the Identity Store is intact

00:15:48.626 --> 00:15:49.576 A:middle
since the last time you've

00:15:49.576 --> 00:15:51.636 A:middle
updated it.

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:52.746 A:middle
If you previously saved any

00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:53.756 A:middle
credential identities to the

00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:55.826 A:middle
store, this will return true,

00:15:56.436 --> 00:15:57.646 A:middle
indicating you should use the

00:15:57.646 --> 00:15:59.146 A:middle
incremental Save Credential

00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:00.696 A:middle
Identities and Remove Credential
