00:09:59.236 --> 00:10:02.726 A:middle
If that authentication is

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:04.686 A:middle
successful, AutoFill will fill

00:10:04.686 --> 00:10:05.856 A:middle
the username and the password in

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:05.976 A:middle
the app.

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:08.676 A:middle
There is a lot going on here, so

00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:09.596 A:middle
I'm going to walk through the

00:10:09.596 --> 00:10:10.666 A:middle
steps you need to take as a

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:11.856 A:middle
developer to support this

00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:12.286 A:middle
workflow.

00:10:12.816 --> 00:10:16.096 A:middle
The three things you need to do

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:17.656 A:middle
are provide AutoFill with the

00:10:17.656 --> 00:10:18.866 A:middle
credential identities you want

00:10:18.866 --> 00:10:19.966 A:middle
it to suggest to the user.

00:10:20.926 --> 00:10:21.836 A:middle
Implement support in your

00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:22.736 A:middle
extension to provide the

00:10:22.736 --> 00:10:24.196 A:middle
passwords when those suggestions

00:10:24.196 --> 00:10:26.266 A:middle
are selected, and display custom

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:27.666 A:middle
UI in your extension to

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:28.866 A:middle
authenticate the user before

00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:30.446 A:middle
returning the credential, if

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:31.546 A:middle
your UX requires it.

00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:33.736 A:middle
Once again, this step is

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:34.196 A:middle
optional.

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.036 A:middle
If you don't show custom UI for

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:37.716 A:middle
authentication, AutoFill will

00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:38.646 A:middle
perform appropriate

00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:39.746 A:middle
authentication for you.

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:44.296 A:middle
Credential identities are

00:10:44.296 --> 00:10:46.246 A:middle
represented by instances of AS

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:47.606 A:middle
Password Credential Identity.

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:49.526 A:middle
This class contains all the

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:50.816 A:middle
information about a credential

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.126 A:middle
that AutoFill needs to know in

00:10:52.126 --> 00:10:53.246 A:middle
order to determine where to

00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:53.746 A:middle
offer it.

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:55.636 A:middle
This includes a service

00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:57.526 A:middle
identifier, which tells AutoFill

00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:59.036 A:middle
which apps or websites to

00:10:59.036 --> 00:11:00.336 A:middle
suggest the credential on.
