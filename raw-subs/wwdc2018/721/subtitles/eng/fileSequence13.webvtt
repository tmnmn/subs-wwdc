00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:00.796 A:middle
identities in the store, so the

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:02.066 A:middle
newly-fetched credentials could

00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:03.226 A:middle
be suggested on the QuickType

00:13:03.226 --> 00:13:03.406 A:middle
bar.

00:13:03.926 --> 00:13:08.506 A:middle
As the user adds, removes, or

00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:10.326 A:middle
modifies their credentials, your

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:11.446 A:middle
app updates the Credential

00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:13.556 A:middle
Identity Store so it continues

00:13:13.556 --> 00:13:15.006 A:middle
to accurately reflect this set

00:13:15.006 --> 00:13:16.296 A:middle
of credentials that your app can

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:16.716 A:middle
provide.

00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:20.046 A:middle
These updates might be because

00:13:20.046 --> 00:13:21.466 A:middle
the user locally makes changes

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.426 A:middle
within your app, or perhaps

00:13:23.426 --> 00:13:24.096 A:middle
because your app is

00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:25.566 A:middle
synchronizing changes from other

00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:27.056 A:middle
devices signed into the online

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:27.606 A:middle
service.

00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:31.616 A:middle
Then, if the user were to sign

00:13:31.616 --> 00:13:33.096 A:middle
out of the online service on the

00:13:33.096 --> 00:13:34.926 A:middle
current device, your app would

00:13:34.926 --> 00:13:36.016 A:middle
remove all the credential

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.696 A:middle
identities from the store, so

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:39.136 A:middle
the user doesn't continue to see

00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:40.036 A:middle
suggestions for these

00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:40.606 A:middle
credentials.

00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:46.136 A:middle
In your code, you use the AS

00:13:46.136 --> 00:13:47.826 A:middle
Credential Identity Store Class

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:48.976 A:middle
to interact with the Credential

00:13:48.976 --> 00:13:51.686 A:middle
Identity Store.

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:53.246 A:middle
Using the Replace Credential

00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:55.286 A:middle
Identities With and Remove All

00:13:55.286 --> 00:13:56.946 A:middle
Credential Identities methods,

00:13:57.716 --> 00:13:59.116 A:middle
you can replace or clear the

00:13:59.116 --> 00:14:00.516 A:middle
list of credential identities
