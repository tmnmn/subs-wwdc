00:21:58.936 --> 00:22:00.236 A:middle
identities for AutoFill to

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.486 A:middle
suggest for the QuickType bar.

00:22:02.136 --> 00:22:03.356 A:middle
It can provide the passwords

00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:04.326 A:middle
when those suggestions are

00:22:04.326 --> 00:22:06.316 A:middle
chosen, and it can show the user

00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:07.666 A:middle
a list of all their credentials.

00:22:08.236 --> 00:22:09.496 A:middle
You're now done integrating your

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.926 A:middle
app with Password AutoFill and

00:22:10.926 --> 00:22:11.906 A:middle
the users can enjoy the

00:22:11.906 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
convenience of AutoFilling

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.576 A:middle
Passwords saved into your app

00:22:14.806 --> 00:22:15.646 A:middle
wherever they're needed.

00:22:18.276 --> 00:22:19.636 A:middle
There are just a few more

00:22:19.676 --> 00:22:20.906 A:middle
general best practices to

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:22.156 A:middle
consider while developing your

00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:22.706 A:middle
extension.

00:22:23.256 --> 00:22:27.496 A:middle
As discussed before, your

00:22:27.496 --> 00:22:28.856 A:middle
principal view controller may be

00:22:28.856 --> 00:22:30.396 A:middle
responsible for showing the UI

00:22:30.396 --> 00:22:31.256 A:middle
for a diverse set of

00:22:31.256 --> 00:22:32.076 A:middle
functionalities.

00:22:32.866 --> 00:22:34.156 A:middle
To achieve this, we recommend

00:22:34.156 --> 00:22:35.536 A:middle
using separate view controllers

00:22:35.536 --> 00:22:36.876 A:middle
managed by your principal view

00:22:36.876 --> 00:22:37.376 A:middle
controller.

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:40.286 A:middle
For example, you may want to

00:22:40.286 --> 00:22:41.756 A:middle
have one view controller class

00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:42.786 A:middle
for displaying the credential

00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:43.146 A:middle
list.

00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:44.896 A:middle
And another for authenticating

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:45.886 A:middle
the user when filling

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:46.546 A:middle
credentials.

00:22:47.056 --> 00:22:48.996 A:middle
You can either present these

00:22:48.996 --> 00:22:50.066 A:middle
view controllers from your

00:22:50.066 --> 00:22:51.826 A:middle
principal view controller, or

00:22:51.826 --> 00:22:53.306 A:middle
use view controller containment

00:22:53.376 --> 00:22:54.366 A:middle
to embed their views.

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.496 A:middle
And if you prepare your

00:22:56.496 --> 00:22:57.746 A:middle
interface by presenting view

00:22:57.746 --> 00:22:59.366 A:middle
controllers, the presentation

00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:00.206 A:middle
should be done without
