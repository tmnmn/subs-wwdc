00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:00.566 A:middle
logging in, so you can suggest

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.926 A:middle
the most relevant credentials.

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:05.436 A:middle
AutoFill will do this by

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:06.736 A:middle
preparing a list of AS

00:05:06.736 --> 00:05:08.086 A:middle
credentials service identifier

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:09.446 A:middle
objects, representing the

00:05:09.446 --> 00:05:10.716 A:middle
service the user is currently

00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:11.146 A:middle
using.

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:12.956 A:middle
Your extension may receive

00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:14.636 A:middle
multiple service identifiers, if

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:16.086 A:middle
AutoFill can determine multiple

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
better [inaudible] to use in the

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:18.236 A:middle
current context.

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:21.866 A:middle
In apps, service identifiers are

00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:23.216 A:middle
based on the app's associated

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
domains.

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:25.976 A:middle
Apps that have adopted universal

00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:27.876 A:middle
links hand-off or shared web

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:29.346 A:middle
credentials will have associated

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:29.856 A:middle
domains.

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:32.606 A:middle
For example, the Shiny app is

00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:33.456 A:middle
associated with

00:05:33.456 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
shiny.example.com, so AutoFill

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:37.586 A:middle
will provide your extension a

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:39.086 A:middle
service identifier of type

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:41.436 A:middle
domain for shiny.example.com.

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:44.286 A:middle
In Safari, the service

00:05:44.286 --> 00:05:46.056 A:middle
identifiers are based on the URL

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:47.336 A:middle
of the current page the user is

00:05:47.336 --> 00:05:47.966 A:middle
logging into.

00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:52.976 A:middle
AutoFill will send the service

00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:54.786 A:middle
identifiers to your extension by

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:56.186 A:middle
calling the prepared credential

00:05:56.186 --> 00:05:57.796 A:middle
list for service identifiers

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.266 A:middle
method on your view controller.
