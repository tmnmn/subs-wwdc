00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:02.746 A:middle
When the user selects one of the

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:05.106 A:middle
suggestions, AutoFill launches

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:06.496 A:middle
your app extension to ask it for

00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:07.846 A:middle
the full credential, including

00:09:07.846 --> 00:09:08.346 A:middle
the password.

00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:11.516 A:middle
It will tell your extension

00:09:11.596 --> 00:09:12.736 A:middle
which credential identity the

00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:16.216 A:middle
user chose, then your extension

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:17.556 A:middle
looks up the password belonging

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:18.926 A:middle
to the selected credential in

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.316 A:middle
your app's password database.

00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:22.736 A:middle
At this point, the extension has

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.426 A:middle
the option to present its own UI

00:09:24.546 --> 00:09:25.806 A:middle
before returning the password.

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:27.826 A:middle
This is useful for password

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
manager apps that ask the user

00:09:29.246 --> 00:09:31.126 A:middle
to enter a master password, or

00:09:31.126 --> 00:09:32.016 A:middle
perform another type of

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:34.266 A:middle
authentication specific to the

00:09:36.556 --> 00:09:36.626 A:middle
app.

00:09:36.886 --> 00:09:37.976 A:middle
Once your extension has the

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:39.906 A:middle
password, it packages it in an

00:09:39.906 --> 00:09:41.536 A:middle
AS password credential and hands

00:09:41.536 --> 00:09:42.796 A:middle
it to AutoFill by completing the

00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:43.736 A:middle
extension request.

00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:47.426 A:middle
If the extension didn't show its

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:49.476 A:middle
own UI, AutoFill will perform

00:09:49.476 --> 00:09:50.826 A:middle
appropriate authentication for

00:09:50.826 --> 00:09:51.296 A:middle
the user.

00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:53.346 A:middle
Depending on the device and the

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:55.116 A:middle
user's preference, this may be

00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:57.356 A:middle
Face ID, Touch ID, Device

00:09:57.356 --> 00:09:58.666 A:middle
Passcode, or None.

00:09:59.236 --> 00:10:02.726 A:middle
If that authentication is
