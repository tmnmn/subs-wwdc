00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
describing the roles played by

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:03.176 A:middle
your code, the system, and the

00:08:03.176 --> 00:08:04.536 A:middle
app where the user is signing

00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:05.123 A:middle
in.

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:09.186 A:middle
To start with, your app needs to

00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:10.876 A:middle
let AutoFill know ahead of time

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:12.356 A:middle
what credentials it wants to

00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:13.606 A:middle
make available for the QuickType

00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:13.816 A:middle
bar.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:16.266 A:middle
Your app provides AutoFill a

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:17.996 A:middle
list of credential identities.

00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:19.846 A:middle
The credential identity includes

00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:21.106 A:middle
information about a credential,

00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:22.746 A:middle
such as the username and the

00:08:22.746 --> 00:08:24.616 A:middle
service, but not the password.

00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:28.116 A:middle
When the user begins signing

00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:29.886 A:middle
into an app, the app talks to

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:31.356 A:middle
AutoFill, and lets it know when

00:08:31.356 --> 00:08:32.756 A:middle
a username or password field is

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:33.356 A:middle
focused.

00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:35.946 A:middle
AutoFill then looks for

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:36.796 A:middle
appropriate credential

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:38.046 A:middle
identities to suggest for the

00:08:38.046 --> 00:08:38.265 A:middle
app.

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:39.866 A:middle
It does this by searching

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:40.616 A:middle
through the credential

00:08:40.616 --> 00:08:41.635 A:middle
identities that your app has

00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:43.076 A:middle
already provided, so your

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:44.176 A:middle
extension doesn't need to be

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:44.706 A:middle
launched yet.

00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:46.856 A:middle
If there are any matching

00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:47.726 A:middle
credential identities to

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:49.886 A:middle
suggest, AutoFill displays them

00:08:49.886 --> 00:08:50.616 A:middle
on the QuickType bar.

00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:53.096 A:middle
These suggestions are rendered

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:54.666 A:middle
privately by the system, so the

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:56.246 A:middle
app isn't yet able to determine

00:08:56.246 --> 00:08:57.466 A:middle
what credentials the user has

00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:58.946 A:middle
saved for the app.
