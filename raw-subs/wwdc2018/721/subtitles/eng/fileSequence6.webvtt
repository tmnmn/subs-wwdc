00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:02.066 A:middle
Here, your extension should set

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.526 A:middle
up its UI for displaying the

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.466 A:middle
user's credentials, and it can

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:06.546 A:middle
use the provided service

00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:08.156 A:middle
identifiers to prioritize the

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:09.166 A:middle
most relevant ones.

00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:11.326 A:middle
From here, two things can

00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:11.636 A:middle
happen.

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:15.286 A:middle
If the user chooses to dismiss

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:16.656 A:middle
your extension, you tell the

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:18.306 A:middle
system about this by calling

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:20.456 A:middle
Cancel Request With Error on

00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:21.586 A:middle
your view controller's extension

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.906 A:middle
context, and AutoFill will

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:24.886 A:middle
dismiss your extension.

00:06:28.976 --> 00:06:30.886 A:middle
Otherwise, if the user selects a

00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:32.086 A:middle
credential they want to use,

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:33.976 A:middle
your extension creates an AS

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:35.736 A:middle
password credential object based

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:37.596 A:middle
on the user's selection and then

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.286 A:middle
hands it to AutoFill by calling

00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:40.596 A:middle
the complete request with

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:42.106 A:middle
selected credential method on

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:43.206 A:middle
the extension context.

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:45.526 A:middle
And AutoFill will use that

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:47.236 A:middle
credential to fill the username

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:49.126 A:middle
and password in the app.

00:06:51.656 --> 00:06:53.036 A:middle
There are a few best practices

00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:53.986 A:middle
the credential list should

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.276 A:middle
adhere to for the best user

00:06:55.276 --> 00:06:55.926 A:middle
experience.

00:06:56.946 --> 00:06:58.426 A:middle
First of all, be sure to include

00:06:58.426 --> 00:06:59.856 A:middle
a button in your UI to cancel

00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:00.456 A:middle
the request.
