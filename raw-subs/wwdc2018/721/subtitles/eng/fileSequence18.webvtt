00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
The most important thing to keep

00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:01.526 A:middle
in mind when implementing this

00:18:01.526 --> 00:18:02.896 A:middle
functionality is that your

00:18:02.896 --> 00:18:04.346 A:middle
extension needs to respond to

00:18:04.346 --> 00:18:05.846 A:middle
the initial non-UI request

00:18:05.846 --> 00:18:07.376 A:middle
quickly, regardless of the

00:18:07.376 --> 00:18:07.896 A:middle
results.

00:18:09.316 --> 00:18:11.066 A:middle
Your UI hasn't been presented

00:18:11.066 --> 00:18:12.816 A:middle
yet, so it's not obvious to the

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.086 A:middle
user that your extension is

00:18:14.086 --> 00:18:15.056 A:middle
working in the background.

00:18:16.076 --> 00:18:17.226 A:middle
If it takes a long time to

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:18.776 A:middle
return the password, the user

00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:20.676 A:middle
may perceive the system, your

00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:22.246 A:middle
app, or the service they're

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:23.846 A:middle
using as being unresponsive.

00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:25.786 A:middle
This would be a poor user

00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:26.426 A:middle
experience.

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:29.436 A:middle
And this is so important.

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.396 A:middle
If a few seconds pass, and your

00:18:31.396 --> 00:18:32.556 A:middle
extension hasn't returned the

00:18:32.556 --> 00:18:34.586 A:middle
password, requested to show its

00:18:34.586 --> 00:18:36.356 A:middle
UI, or canceled with another

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:38.116 A:middle
error, AutoFill will cancel the

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.336 A:middle
extension without filling the

00:18:39.336 --> 00:18:39.776 A:middle
credential.

00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:43.486 A:middle
However, this timeout doesn't

00:18:43.486 --> 00:18:45.376 A:middle
happen for debug builds, or when

00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:47.066 A:middle
running on the simulator, so you

00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:48.226 A:middle
can take your time to debug the

00:18:48.226 --> 00:18:49.556 A:middle
extension without the system

00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:49.996 A:middle
interrupting.

00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:55.746 A:middle
When you're implementing support

00:18:55.746 --> 00:18:56.736 A:middle
for displaying your app's

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:57.726 A:middle
credentials on the QuickType

00:18:57.726 --> 00:18:59.346 A:middle
bar, it's essential that you

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
keep the Credential Identity
