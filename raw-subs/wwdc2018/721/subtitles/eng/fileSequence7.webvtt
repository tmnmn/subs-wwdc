00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:00.456 A:middle
the request.

00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:02.616 A:middle
The user may change their mind

00:07:02.616 --> 00:07:03.986 A:middle
about signing into the service,

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.136 A:middle
or realize they don't have a

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:06.746 A:middle
credential saved, so you should

00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:08.096 A:middle
support letting the user dismiss

00:07:08.096 --> 00:07:09.466 A:middle
your extension without selecting

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:09.956 A:middle
a credential.

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:14.746 A:middle
Also, your credential list UI

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:16.006 A:middle
should make it possible to see

00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:17.646 A:middle
all credentials, whether or not

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:18.536 A:middle
they match the service

00:07:18.536 --> 00:07:19.216 A:middle
identifiers.

00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:21.486 A:middle
In some cases, the user may need

00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:22.526 A:middle
to choose a credential from a

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:23.246 A:middle
different domain.

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:25.516 A:middle
Allowing the user to access

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:26.776 A:middle
their entire set of credentials

00:07:26.776 --> 00:07:28.256 A:middle
from the list, ensures your

00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:29.696 A:middle
extension is always useful.

00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:33.576 A:middle
And user authentication is

00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:35.096 A:middle
completely up to your extension.

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:36.796 A:middle
If you need to authenticate the

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:38.236 A:middle
user, you should do so when the

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:39.426 A:middle
credential list is presented.

00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:43.396 A:middle
And that is how you can

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.596 A:middle
implement a credential list in

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.936 A:middle
your extension so your app's

00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:47.576 A:middle
credentials are available to use

00:07:47.576 --> 00:07:48.466 A:middle
when signing in anywhere.

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:51.566 A:middle
Now we will make this even more

00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:53.206 A:middle
convenient by allowing AutoFill

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.396 A:middle
to surface these credentials

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:55.566 A:middle
directly on the QuickType bar.

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:58.346 A:middle
I'll start with an overview of

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.516 A:middle
how this process works,

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
describing the roles played by
