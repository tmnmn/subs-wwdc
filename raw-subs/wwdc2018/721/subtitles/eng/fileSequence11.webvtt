suggest the credential on.

00:11:01.496 --> 00:11:03.086 A:middle
The username of the credential,

00:11:03.626 --> 00:11:06.646 A:middle
and optional record identifier

00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:07.906 A:middle
string that you can use to

00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:09.086 A:middle
correlate this identity to a

00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:10.176 A:middle
record in your app's own

00:11:10.176 --> 00:11:13.446 A:middle
database, and a rank parameter.

00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:15.776 A:middle
If the user has more credentials

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.166 A:middle
for a particular service than

00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:19.006 A:middle
the QuickType bar can show, you

00:11:19.006 --> 00:11:20.196 A:middle
can use the rank parameter to

00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:21.156 A:middle
mark certain credential

00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:22.626 A:middle
identities as higher or lower

00:11:22.626 --> 00:11:23.206 A:middle
priority.

00:11:24.436 --> 00:11:25.556 A:middle
Credential identities having a

00:11:25.656 --> 00:11:26.826 A:middle
higher rank value will be

00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:27.956 A:middle
ordered before credential

00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:29.466 A:middle
identities with lower ranks.

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:34.316 A:middle
These credential identities get

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:35.696 A:middle
saved to the Credential Identity

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.426 A:middle
Store, which is the database

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:38.896 A:middle
inside your app's container that

00:11:38.896 --> 00:11:40.606 A:middle
you can modify using the AS

00:11:40.606 --> 00:11:42.296 A:middle
Credential Identity Store class.

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.846 A:middle
AutoFill suggests credentials to

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:46.276 A:middle
the user by searching through

00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:47.456 A:middle
your app's Credential Identity

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:47.736 A:middle
Store.

00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:51.836 A:middle
The Credential Identity Store is

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.196 A:middle
secured with complete unless

00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:55.026 A:middle
open data protection, so no

00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:56.446 A:middle
operations can start while the

00:11:56.446 --> 00:11:57.266 A:middle
device is locked.

00:11:58.246 --> 00:11:59.416 A:middle
The system never syncs the
