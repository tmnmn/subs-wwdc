00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:00.556 A:middle
your app's capabilities.

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:02.716 A:middle
This adds a required entitlement

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:04.116 A:middle
to your app, and links it to the

00:04:04.116 --> 00:04:05.696 A:middle
new authentication services

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.716 A:middle
framework, which provides the

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:08.936 A:middle
APIs for Password Autofill

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:09.416 A:middle
integration.

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:13.936 A:middle
Next, you will need to add an

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:15.316 A:middle
AutoFill Credential Provider

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:16.456 A:middle
Extension target to your

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:16.946 A:middle
project.

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:19.296 A:middle
Xcode 10 includes a new template

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:20.116 A:middle
for this extension.

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:23.666 A:middle
The template will create a view

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:24.706 A:middle
controller class for you.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:26.876 A:middle
A subclass of AS credential

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:27.986 A:middle
provider view controller.

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.326 A:middle
When AutoFill needs to invoke

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:31.766 A:middle
your extension, it will create

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:33.336 A:middle
an instance of this class and

00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:34.366 A:middle
call certain methods on it,

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:35.606 A:middle
which your subclass will

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:36.026 A:middle
override.

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:38.996 A:middle
So once you've configured your

00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:41.146 A:middle
project, the first thing to

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:42.626 A:middle
implement in your extension is

00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:43.756 A:middle
the list of credentials that the

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:44.726 A:middle
user can bring up from the

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:45.286 A:middle
QuickType bar.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:46.866 A:middle
Here is how this works.

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:50.616 A:middle
When the user is signing into an

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:51.926 A:middle
app, they can use the QuickType

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:53.076 A:middle
bar to bring up your credential

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:53.376 A:middle
list.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.306 A:middle
At this point, AutoFill will

00:04:56.306 --> 00:04:57.776 A:middle
launch your app extension and

00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:58.946 A:middle
let it know where the user is

00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:00.566 A:middle
logging in, so you can suggest
