00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:19.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to the

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:20.916 A:middle
session on implementing AutoFill

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.386 A:middle
Credential Provider Extensions.

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:25.246 A:middle
In this video, I'll first give

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:26.506 A:middle
an overview of the Password

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:28.006 A:middle
AutoFill feature and how it is

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:29.186 A:middle
improved in iOS 12.

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:31.986 A:middle
After that I'll go into detail

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.546 A:middle
about how Password Manager apps

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:34.786 A:middle
can now integrate with Password

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:37.056 A:middle
AutoFill using new APIs in iOS

00:00:37.056 --> 00:00:37.326 A:middle
12.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:39.886 A:middle
And along the way, I will

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:41.256 A:middle
recommend a few best practices

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:42.746 A:middle
to take as you adopt these new

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:43.866 A:middle
APIs.

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:47.486 A:middle
First, let's talk about Password

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:47.906 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:52.596 A:middle
iOS 11 brought two major

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:53.506 A:middle
improvements to Password

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:53.946 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:56.186 A:middle
First, the most relevant

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:57.266 A:middle
credentials were displayed

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.416 A:middle
directly on the QuickType bar,

00:00:58.706 --> 00:00:59.876 A:middle
so they're only one tap away,
