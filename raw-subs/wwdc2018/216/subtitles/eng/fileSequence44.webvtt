00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:01.606 A:middle
If we can start accessing this

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:04.826 A:middle
document, we simply create a

00:44:04.826 --> 00:44:06.666 A:middle
bookmarkData block from this

00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:08.076 A:middle
document, and encode it.

00:44:08.576 --> 00:44:11.986 A:middle
And, finally, we don't forget to

00:44:11.986 --> 00:44:12.556 A:middle
call super.

00:44:13.816 --> 00:44:16.116 A:middle
Alright. Now that we know how to

00:44:16.116 --> 00:44:17.506 A:middle
encode our restorable state,

00:44:17.846 --> 00:44:19.926 A:middle
we'll implement restorable state

00:44:19.926 --> 00:44:20.486 A:middle
decoding.

00:44:21.146 --> 00:44:23.366 A:middle
And, to do this, we start

00:44:23.366 --> 00:44:23.916 A:middle
implementing

00:44:23.916 --> 00:44:25.126 A:middle
decodeRestorableState.

00:44:25.686 --> 00:44:27.266 A:middle
And, we'll do the inverse steps.

00:44:28.036 --> 00:44:29.506 A:middle
So, first we get the

00:44:29.506 --> 00:44:30.896 A:middle
bookmarkData from the coder.

00:44:31.526 --> 00:44:34.396 A:middle
And, if it exists, create that

00:44:34.396 --> 00:44:36.166 A:middle
document URL using the URL

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:38.346 A:middle
resolvingBookmarkData call.

00:44:38.886 --> 00:44:42.556 A:middle
And, we simply present the

00:44:42.556 --> 00:44:45.506 A:middle
document at that URL.

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:47.956 A:middle
And, last but not least, we

00:44:47.956 --> 00:44:49.106 A:middle
don't forget to call super.

00:44:50.496 --> 00:44:51.916 A:middle
Alright. So, let's run our app.

00:44:57.646 --> 00:44:59.156 A:middle
And so, our app will now be

00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:00.686 A:middle
launched in the simulator.
