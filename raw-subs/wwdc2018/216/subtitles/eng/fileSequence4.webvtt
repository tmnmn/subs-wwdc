00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
Lastly, we've seen great

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.186 A:middle
adoption from all of you

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:02.996 A:middle
developers and cloud vendors

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.046 A:middle
over the course of the last

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:04.246 A:middle
year.

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:05.996 A:middle
So, there's a lot of

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
applications that use this

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:07.826 A:middle
technology already.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.166 A:middle
So, now is a great time to try

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:10.686 A:middle
adopting

00:04:10.686 --> 00:04:12.236 A:middle
UIDocumentBrowserViewController

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:13.536 A:middle
in your application today.

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.516 A:middle
And, if you're a cloud vendor

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:17.396 A:middle
that hasn't yet already provided

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:18.946 A:middle
a file provider extension, now's

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:19.805 A:middle
the time to do so.

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.036 A:middle
So, let's talk about a few new

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:23.836 A:middle
things.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:26.636 A:middle
First, for cloud vendors, we've

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:28.956 A:middle
seen some of the difficulties in

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:29.956 A:middle
making a file provider

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:30.586 A:middle
extension.

00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:32.056 A:middle
And, what we're happy to

00:04:32.056 --> 00:04:33.396 A:middle
announce today is there's a new

00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:34.036 A:middle
tool for you.

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.126 A:middle
It's called the File

00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:36.586 A:middle
Provider-Validation tool.

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:39.486 A:middle
This tool will guide you-- will

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:41.376 A:middle
help-- will run tests, and show

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.376 A:middle
you the issues with your file

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:43.606 A:middle
provider extension, and guide

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:44.836 A:middle
you towards fixing those.

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:46.466 A:middle
It's available for download

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:48.206 A:middle
today from developer.apple.com.

00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:49.886 A:middle
And, when you download it,

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:51.876 A:middle
you'll get a couple of things.

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:53.746 A:middle
You're going to get a set of

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:55.056 A:middle
source files that you'll need to

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:56.196 A:middle
add to your file provider

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.666 A:middle
extension project, and an iOS

00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:00.426 A:middle
application to install and run
