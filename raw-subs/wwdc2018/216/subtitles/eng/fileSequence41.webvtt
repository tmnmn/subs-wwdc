00:40:59.866 --> 00:41:01.446 A:middle
And so, when we relaunch our

00:41:01.446 --> 00:41:03.886 A:middle
app, we again lose access to

00:41:03.886 --> 00:41:05.986 A:middle
this document, even if that

00:41:05.986 --> 00:41:07.216 A:middle
document wasn't moved or

00:41:07.216 --> 00:41:07.646 A:middle
renamed.

00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:12.026 A:middle
The correct solution is to use a

00:41:12.026 --> 00:41:13.886 A:middle
security scoped bookmark, that

00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:15.176 A:middle
we get from our URL.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:17.376 A:middle
And, as you can see, the

00:41:17.376 --> 00:41:18.886 A:middle
bookmark correctly references

00:41:18.886 --> 00:41:20.906 A:middle
the document, even if it has

00:41:20.906 --> 00:41:21.966 A:middle
been moved or renamed.

00:41:27.316 --> 00:41:29.206 A:middle
To save the security scoped

00:41:29.206 --> 00:41:31.326 A:middle
bookmark, we must first get it

00:41:31.326 --> 00:41:33.166 A:middle
from the URL, using the

00:41:33.166 --> 00:41:35.356 A:middle
bookmarkData API on the URL.

00:41:35.676 --> 00:41:37.226 A:middle
And, we will then persist it to

00:41:37.226 --> 00:41:37.566 A:middle
disk.

00:41:38.636 --> 00:41:40.596 A:middle
Once our app is relaunched, we

00:41:40.596 --> 00:41:42.386 A:middle
can restore the original URL

00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:44.516 A:middle
using the URL resulting

00:41:44.516 --> 00:41:47.546 A:middle
bookmarkData call.

00:41:47.746 --> 00:41:49.636 A:middle
Alright. Now that we have all

00:41:49.636 --> 00:41:51.036 A:middle
the ingredients to save and

00:41:51.036 --> 00:41:53.076 A:middle
restore UI state, let's jump to

00:41:53.076 --> 00:41:53.776 A:middle
a quick demo to see it in

00:41:53.776 --> 00:41:53.926 A:middle
action.
