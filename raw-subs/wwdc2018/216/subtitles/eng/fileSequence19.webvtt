00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
picker of the controller.

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:05.956 A:middle
So, I can drag an action from my

00:19:06.786 --> 00:19:10.036 A:middle
button to the source code, and I

00:19:10.036 --> 00:19:11.996 A:middle
agree to call it Choose Image,

00:19:12.556 --> 00:19:13.976 A:middle
and [inaudible].

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:14.986 A:middle
Connect.

00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:17.546 A:middle
And, now I have twice my code.

00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:20.406 A:middle
So, let me display this in a

00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:21.976 A:middle
bigger window.

00:19:26.076 --> 00:19:27.976 A:middle
Here I am in my chooseImage

00:19:28.196 --> 00:19:28.556 A:middle
method.

00:19:28.996 --> 00:19:31.396 A:middle
I'm going first to create a

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:32.696 A:middle
Document Picker controller.

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:34.826 A:middle
And, I specify the type of files

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:36.006 A:middle
I want my customers to choose.

00:19:36.396 --> 00:19:38.426 A:middle
So, here this is UTTypeImage,

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:40.666 A:middle
and the mode.

00:19:40.966 --> 00:19:42.306 A:middle
I'm using .import here because I

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.896 A:middle
want to embed the particle image

00:19:44.896 --> 00:19:45.536 A:middle
in my document.

00:19:46.236 --> 00:19:48.696 A:middle
But, in many cases, you will use

00:19:48.696 --> 00:19:49.316 A:middle
[inaudible] here instead.

00:19:51.536 --> 00:19:54.256 A:middle
You set your document picker

00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:56.056 A:middle
delegate, and you present it.

00:19:57.406 --> 00:19:59.986 A:middle
When the Document Picker gets

00:19:59.986 --> 00:20:02.796 A:middle
invoked, and the file is chosen,
