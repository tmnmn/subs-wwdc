00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.936 A:middle
iOS already, and then you need

00:23:00.936 --> 00:23:04.216 A:middle
to claim it to tell iOS you can

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:06.486 A:middle
view or edit files of this type.

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.726 A:middle
Let's start with type

00:23:09.726 --> 00:23:10.326 A:middle
declaration.

00:23:10.836 --> 00:23:13.056 A:middle
The first question you need to

00:23:13.056 --> 00:23:15.106 A:middle
ask yourself is, do you need to

00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:15.616 A:middle
declare it?

00:23:16.486 --> 00:23:19.146 A:middle
Because in most cases, you'll be

00:23:19.146 --> 00:23:20.666 A:middle
dealing with common file types,

00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:23.316 A:middle
such as videos, images, PDFs,

00:23:23.366 --> 00:23:24.896 A:middle
presentations, spreadsheets.

00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:28.226 A:middle
If that is the case, iOS most

00:23:28.226 --> 00:23:30.276 A:middle
likely already declared this for

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:30.416 A:middle
you.

00:23:31.266 --> 00:23:32.626 A:middle
And, to know if this is the

00:23:32.626 --> 00:23:35.056 A:middle
case, you can check out the

00:23:35.056 --> 00:23:37.846 A:middle
documentation at this short URL.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:42.996 A:middle
If that is the case, great, you

00:23:42.996 --> 00:23:45.386 A:middle
do not have anything to do, and

00:23:45.386 --> 00:23:47.106 A:middle
you can jump to claiming the

00:23:47.646 --> 00:23:47.746 A:middle
type.

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:53.276 A:middle
The other common case, is when

00:23:53.276 --> 00:23:55.326 A:middle
you wrote an app which defines

00:23:55.446 --> 00:23:56.756 A:middle
its own file format.

00:23:57.856 --> 00:23:58.996 A:middle
You invented your own file

00:23:58.996 --> 00:24:00.716 A:middle
format, and you get to define
