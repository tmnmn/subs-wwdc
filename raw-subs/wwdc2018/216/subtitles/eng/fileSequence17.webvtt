00:17:00.076 --> 00:17:03.196 A:middle
And, [inaudible] single URL,

00:17:03.636 --> 00:17:05.236 A:middle
because there's a property you

00:17:05.236 --> 00:17:07.646 A:middle
can set in the Picker to let

00:17:07.646 --> 00:17:09.566 A:middle
your customer choose multiple

00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:11.185 A:middle
files at once.

00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:17.156 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and add a

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.286 A:middle
Document Picker to our demo app,

00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:21.886 A:middle
Particles, from last year.

00:17:26.455 --> 00:17:28.516 A:middle
This is the app [inaudible] last

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:28.626 A:middle
year.

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:30.316 A:middle
It is based on the Document

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.066 A:middle
Browser to let me choose a file

00:17:32.066 --> 00:17:32.486 A:middle
to open.

00:17:33.496 --> 00:17:35.116 A:middle
As you can see, I have Recents,

00:17:35.116 --> 00:17:36.876 A:middle
I have Tags, I have Search, I

00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:38.866 A:middle
have Browse to list all my

00:17:38.866 --> 00:17:39.276 A:middle
sources.

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:41.136 A:middle
All of this comes for free.

00:17:42.506 --> 00:17:44.976 A:middle
Now, I can go ahead and open

00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:48.006 A:middle
this file, and I can tweak this

00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:49.536 A:middle
nice particle system.

00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:53.586 A:middle
Now, my customers love this app.

00:17:54.436 --> 00:17:56.546 A:middle
But, they would like to make the

00:17:56.546 --> 00:17:59.906 A:middle
particles a little nicer.
