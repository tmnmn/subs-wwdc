shows up exactly where it needs

00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:05.556 A:middle
to be, and help customers find

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:05.676 A:middle
it.

00:32:05.676 --> 00:32:08.676 A:middle
And with this, I'm going to hand

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:09.776 A:middle
the stage over to my colleague

00:32:09.776 --> 00:32:09.976 A:middle
Ronny.

00:32:16.076 --> 00:32:16.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Thomas.

00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:18.136 A:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:32:18.516 --> 00:32:20.026 A:middle
I am Rony Fadel, a software

00:32:20.026 --> 00:32:21.346 A:middle
engineer on the Documents

00:32:21.346 --> 00:32:22.836 A:middle
Management team.

00:32:23.356 --> 00:32:25.306 A:middle
So, Thomas has explained how

00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:27.256 A:middle
easy it is to adopt a document

00:32:27.486 --> 00:32:29.486 A:middle
browser and document picker

00:32:29.486 --> 00:32:30.946 A:middle
API's in your app.

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:32.826 A:middle
Now, that you've adopted these

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.586 A:middle
API's, we'd like to cover some

00:32:34.586 --> 00:32:36.526 A:middle
best practices to make sure that

00:32:36.526 --> 00:32:38.066 A:middle
your app is a well-behaved

00:32:38.126 --> 00:32:40.736 A:middle
citizen on the iOS ecosystem,

00:32:41.196 --> 00:32:44.186 A:middle
the day you submit it to the App

00:32:44.456 --> 00:32:44.856 A:middle
Store.

00:32:44.856 --> 00:32:46.906 A:middle
So, now that we've implemented a

00:32:46.906 --> 00:32:48.986 A:middle
document browser-based app, or

00:32:48.986 --> 00:32:51.596 A:middle
added picker support, now we're

00:32:51.596 --> 00:32:52.806 A:middle
ready finally to pick some

00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:53.366 A:middle
documents.

00:32:54.446 --> 00:32:56.146 A:middle
Your app might want to access

00:32:56.146 --> 00:32:58.816 A:middle
documents directly, avoiding the

00:32:58.816 --> 00:33:00.906 A:middle
copies in import mode that
