00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:01.366 A:middle
So, what can you do with all of

00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:02.006 A:middle
this information?

00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:05.866 A:middle
Well, first, if you have a need

00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:07.566 A:middle
to access files in the cloud,

00:31:07.906 --> 00:31:09.106 A:middle
you should use the Document

00:31:09.106 --> 00:31:10.336 A:middle
Browser or Document Picker to

00:31:10.626 --> 00:31:11.676 A:middle
access these documents.

00:31:12.646 --> 00:31:15.216 A:middle
Most cloud vendors have adopted

00:31:15.836 --> 00:31:18.836 A:middle
our API's, so if you use one of

00:31:18.836 --> 00:31:20.206 A:middle
these viewControllers, your

00:31:20.206 --> 00:31:21.976 A:middle
customers will be able to access

00:31:21.976 --> 00:31:23.866 A:middle
their files no matter where they

00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:24.186 A:middle
are.

00:31:24.546 --> 00:31:26.136 A:middle
And, you do not have to write

00:31:26.136 --> 00:31:28.256 A:middle
code for each cloud vendor.

00:31:29.896 --> 00:31:32.736 A:middle
If you wrote your own custom

00:31:32.816 --> 00:31:35.356 A:middle
document browsing UI before iOS

00:31:35.356 --> 00:31:37.666 A:middle
11, now's a great time to switch

00:31:37.956 --> 00:31:38.216 A:middle
to

00:31:38.216 --> 00:31:39.556 A:middle
UIDocumentBrowserViewController.

00:31:40.896 --> 00:31:42.856 A:middle
It is packed with features--

00:31:43.996 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
it's packed with features, so

00:31:47.316 --> 00:31:49.336 A:middle
please let us do the hard work,

00:31:49.336 --> 00:31:50.626 A:middle
and just get all the features in

00:31:50.626 --> 00:31:51.996 A:middle
your app for free.

00:31:54.196 --> 00:31:55.626 A:middle
Finally, please make sure your

00:31:55.626 --> 00:31:57.226 A:middle
document types are configured in

00:31:57.226 --> 00:31:59.276 A:middle
Xcode properly so that your app

00:31:59.276 --> 00:32:02.386 A:middle
shows up exactly where it needs
