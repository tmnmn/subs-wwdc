00:36:59.366 --> 00:37:01.126 A:middle
they'll simply be a no-op.

00:37:03.176 --> 00:37:05.336 A:middle
Great. Now, we know how to gain

00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:06.626 A:middle
access to our documents.

00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:08.816 A:middle
We can go ahead and pick that

00:37:08.816 --> 00:37:10.396 A:middle
document, like the particle

00:37:10.396 --> 00:37:11.386 A:middle
image in our example.

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:14.466 A:middle
And, start accessing it.

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:16.316 A:middle
As you can see here, the cloud

00:37:16.316 --> 00:37:17.726 A:middle
service that is hosting this

00:37:17.726 --> 00:37:19.706 A:middle
document, as well as other apps

00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:21.606 A:middle
also can access this document,

00:37:21.746 --> 00:37:23.716 A:middle
and sometimes concurrently with

00:37:23.716 --> 00:37:24.966 A:middle
your app.

00:37:25.236 --> 00:37:26.746 A:middle
What we need here is a

00:37:26.746 --> 00:37:29.046 A:middle
system-wide mechanism to make

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:30.396 A:middle
sure that access to this

00:37:30.396 --> 00:37:32.166 A:middle
document is always coordinated,

00:37:32.656 --> 00:37:34.326 A:middle
so that processes don't go

00:37:34.326 --> 00:37:35.666 A:middle
stepping on each other's feet,

00:37:36.076 --> 00:37:38.236 A:middle
accessing, reading, and writing

00:37:38.236 --> 00:37:39.466 A:middle
to this document.

00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:43.806 A:middle
On iOS, this mechanism is called

00:37:43.986 --> 00:37:46.076 A:middle
file coordination, and it is

00:37:46.076 --> 00:37:47.276 A:middle
exposed via the

00:37:47.456 --> 00:37:48.956 A:middle
NSFileCoordinator and

00:37:49.046 --> 00:37:50.486 A:middle
NSFilePresenter API's.

00:37:51.616 --> 00:37:53.316 A:middle
It acts as a system-wide

00:37:53.486 --> 00:37:55.166 A:middle
multiple reader/single writer

00:37:55.166 --> 00:37:58.546 A:middle
lock, and it's also the way for

00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:00.506 A:middle
your app to instruct the system
