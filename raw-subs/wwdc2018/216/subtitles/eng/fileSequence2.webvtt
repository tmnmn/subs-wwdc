00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.316 A:middle
So, by using

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:02.826 A:middle
UIDocumentBrowserViewController

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:04.276 A:middle
in your app, you'll be giving

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:05.796 A:middle
your customers a consistent

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:07.166 A:middle
experience, by bringing all of

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.726 A:middle
the power of Files into your

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:08.925 A:middle
app.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.026 A:middle
It eliminates the need for you

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:12.036 A:middle
to write your own document

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:12.416 A:middle
browser.

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:15.686 A:middle
This allows you to focus on

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:16.846 A:middle
perfecting the experience your

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:18.966 A:middle
customers will have when viewing

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.226 A:middle
or editing documents in your

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:20.566 A:middle
app.

00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:23.516 A:middle
To get started with this, see

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:24.916 A:middle
last year's session, "Building

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:27.636 A:middle
Great Document-based Apps in

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:28.566 A:middle
iOS."

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.556 A:middle
There's also API for cloud

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:32.096 A:middle
vendors.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.016 A:middle
This is called the File Provider

00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:35.306 A:middle
API.

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:37.506 A:middle
You use this to write file

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:39.576 A:middle
provider extensions, and also

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:42.196 A:middle
custom UI actions, including the

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:43.656 A:middle
account sign-in screen.

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.466 A:middle
For application developers, you

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.826 A:middle
don't need to use this API for

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:50.246 A:middle
people to access your files.

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:53.586 A:middle
So, when you write a file

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.086 A:middle
provider extension, it will

00:02:56.086 --> 00:02:57.336 A:middle
appear in the Files app, and in

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:58.296 A:middle
UIDocumentBrowserView

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.256 A:middle
Controllers, under the Locations
