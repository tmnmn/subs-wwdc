00:49:59.016 --> 00:50:02.026 A:middle
We learned about best practices

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.486 A:middle
so that our apps become

00:50:03.486 --> 00:50:05.266 A:middle
excellent at managing documents,

00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:09.296 A:middle
and for you cloud vendors, we

00:50:09.296 --> 00:50:10.406 A:middle
talked about the new Siri

00:50:10.406 --> 00:50:12.456 A:middle
shortcuts, and how they allow

00:50:12.456 --> 00:50:15.276 A:middle
your app-- sorry, your documents

00:50:15.686 --> 00:50:17.866 A:middle
that are frequently accessed to

00:50:17.866 --> 00:50:18.946 A:middle

fileProvider validation tool,

00:50:26.466 --> 00:50:28.296 A:middle
and gave guidelines on how to

00:50:28.296 --> 00:50:29.616 A:middle
implement an effective

00:50:29.616 --> 00:50:31.016 A:middle
authentication flow in your

00:50:31.016 --> 00:50:32.736 A:middle
