00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
from our root type from the

00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:03.206 A:middle
physical hierarchy, which is

00:27:03.296 --> 00:27:04.366 A:middle
public.item.

00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:06.566 A:middle
But, you don't care about this,

00:27:06.616 --> 00:27:08.476 A:middle
you just need to choose between

00:27:08.476 --> 00:27:10.546 A:middle
.data and .package.

00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:12.126 A:middle
Therefore, you have two parents,

00:27:12.726 --> 00:27:14.536 A:middle
public.data and public.content.

00:27:15.586 --> 00:27:17.756 A:middle
So, in my Xcode UI, I'm going to

00:27:17.756 --> 00:27:20.266 A:middle
write, Conforms To public.data,

00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:21.726 A:middle
public.content.

00:27:22.196 --> 00:27:26.336 A:middle
The last thing I need to do is

00:27:26.456 --> 00:27:28.966 A:middle
tell iOS which file extensions

00:27:29.026 --> 00:27:31.786 A:middle
are associated with my type.

00:27:33.016 --> 00:27:35.046 A:middle
This is how iOS will know that

00:27:35.046 --> 00:27:37.086 A:middle
.particles files are of the type

00:27:37.086 --> 00:27:37.796 A:middle
[inaudible] defined.

00:27:38.336 --> 00:27:41.326 A:middle
To do this, I add a UTType

00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:44.836 A:middle
classification property to my

00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:45.786 A:middle
[inaudible] properties.

00:27:46.776 --> 00:27:50.036 A:middle
In this dictionary, I add a key

00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:50.316 A:middle
called

00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:53.436 A:middle
public.filename-extension, and

00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:55.286 A:middle
[inaudible] file extension that

00:27:55.286 --> 00:27:57.466 A:middle
you want to associate with your

00:27:58.756 --> 00:27:58.926 A:middle
type.

00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:01.516 A:middle
So, here I have a new item, of
