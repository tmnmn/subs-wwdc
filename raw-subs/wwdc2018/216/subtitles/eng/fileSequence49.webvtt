00:48:59.866 --> 00:49:01.436 A:middle
the start- and stopAccessing

00:49:01.436 --> 00:49:03.696 A:middle
best practices to make sure that

00:49:03.696 --> 00:49:05.036 A:middle
you interact successfully with

00:49:05.036 --> 00:49:07.726 A:middle
Sandbox documents, or Sandbox--

00:49:08.356 --> 00:49:09.576 A:middle
with the app Sandbox.

00:49:11.096 --> 00:49:13.456 A:middle
And also, coordinate accesses to

00:49:13.456 --> 00:49:15.346 A:middle
your documents to make sure that

00:49:15.346 --> 00:49:17.016 A:middle
you read and write to them in a

00:49:17.016 --> 00:49:19.656 A:middle
consistent state.

00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.476 A:middle
Implement state restoration to

00:49:21.476 --> 00:49:22.986 A:middle
always bring back your customer

00:49:22.986 --> 00:49:24.396 A:middle
to where they were, when they

00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:26.186 A:middle
were using your app, even if

00:49:26.186 --> 00:49:28.096 A:middle
your app is killed in the

00:49:28.716 --> 00:49:29.086 A:middle
background.

00:49:29.086 --> 00:49:31.166 A:middle
Adopt Open in Place, so that

00:49:31.306 --> 00:49:32.876 A:middle
your customer always edits the

00:49:32.876 --> 00:49:34.926 A:middle
original document, and doesn't

00:49:34.926 --> 00:49:37.366 A:middle
need to start editing copies of

00:49:37.366 --> 00:49:37.986 A:middle
that document.

00:49:39.046 --> 00:49:40.346 A:middle
And, also report progress,

00:49:40.466 --> 00:49:42.226 A:middle
especially in a world where most

00:49:42.226 --> 00:49:43.356 A:middle
of these documents could be in

00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:44.726 A:middle
the cloud, and not available

00:49:44.726 --> 00:49:45.116 A:middle
locally.

00:49:46.816 --> 00:49:49.136 A:middle
So, what did we cover today?

00:49:49.936 --> 00:49:51.996 A:middle
We have shown you how easy it is

00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:53.866 A:middle
to adopt the Document Browser

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.116 A:middle
and Document Picker API's.

00:49:55.686 --> 00:49:58.006 A:middle
Give them a try in your app

00:49:58.696 --> 00:49:58.836 A:middle
today.

00:49:59.016 --> 00:50:02.026 A:middle
We learned about best practices
