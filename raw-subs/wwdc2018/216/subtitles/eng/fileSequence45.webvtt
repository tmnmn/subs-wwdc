00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:00.686 A:middle
launched in the simulator.

00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:03.916 A:middle
As you can see, we can start

00:45:04.786 --> 00:45:05.726 A:middle
using our document.

00:45:06.616 --> 00:45:08.586 A:middle
And, again, going to take our

00:45:08.586 --> 00:45:09.556 A:middle
app to the background.

00:45:09.886 --> 00:45:11.676 A:middle
Simulate the system killing our

00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:11.886 A:middle
app.

00:45:16.156 --> 00:45:18.186 A:middle
And, we're going to relaunch our

00:45:18.886 --> 00:45:19.926 A:middle
app, and as you can see here,

00:45:20.246 --> 00:45:20.976 A:middle
we're back to our editor.

00:45:21.516 --> 00:45:28.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:45:29.046 --> 00:45:31.046 A:middle
Awesome. We can now access

00:45:31.046 --> 00:45:32.936 A:middle
documents, read and write to

00:45:32.936 --> 00:45:34.306 A:middle
them without risking data

00:45:34.306 --> 00:45:36.336 A:middle
corruption, and we can now even

00:45:36.336 --> 00:45:37.776 A:middle
restore state and bring our

00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:39.406 A:middle
customer back to where they were

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:40.886 A:middle
when they were using our app.

00:45:41.386 --> 00:45:42.896 A:middle
Even if our app was killed in

00:45:43.696 --> 00:45:44.946 A:middle
the background.

00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:47.246 A:middle
So, if you open the files up,

00:45:47.706 --> 00:45:48.936 A:middle
and we tap on Share in the

00:45:48.936 --> 00:45:50.956 A:middle
callout menu, on documents that

00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:52.976 A:middle
your app can handle, you notice

00:45:52.976 --> 00:45:54.636 A:middle
that our app is now available in

00:45:54.636 --> 00:45:55.136 A:middle
the Share sheet.

00:45:56.096 --> 00:45:58.726 A:middle
However, it says "Copy to"

00:45:58.906 --> 00:45:59.926 A:middle
instead of "Open in."
