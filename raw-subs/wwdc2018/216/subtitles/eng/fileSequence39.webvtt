"Building Document-Based Apps"

00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:06.056 A:middle
session from WWDC 2015, which

00:39:06.056 --> 00:39:07.626 A:middle
covers these topics in great

00:39:09.376 --> 00:39:09.526 A:middle
detail.

00:39:10.036 --> 00:39:11.976 A:middle
Alright. We can now access our

00:39:11.976 --> 00:39:13.466 A:middle
documents, and we are sure to

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:14.696 A:middle
read and write to them in a

00:39:14.696 --> 00:39:15.586 A:middle
consistent state.

00:39:16.446 --> 00:39:18.026 A:middle
We can edit our particle system.

00:39:18.316 --> 00:39:19.526 A:middle
And now, what we're going to do

00:39:19.526 --> 00:39:21.106 A:middle
is just switch apps for just a

00:39:21.106 --> 00:39:22.716 A:middle
second, check out the WWDC

00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:24.646 A:middle
webpage, and just jump back to

00:39:24.646 --> 00:39:25.566 A:middle
our app.

00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:28.526 A:middle
Hmm. As you can see here, we

00:39:28.526 --> 00:39:30.236 A:middle
were in the editor, but now we

00:39:30.236 --> 00:39:31.576 A:middle
went back to the browser.

00:39:32.366 --> 00:39:34.016 A:middle
Your customer always expects to

00:39:34.016 --> 00:39:35.576 A:middle
be brought back to where they

00:39:35.576 --> 00:39:37.416 A:middle
were when they were using your

00:39:38.656 --> 00:39:38.726 A:middle
app.

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.426 A:middle
Let's try to understand what

00:39:40.426 --> 00:39:41.726 A:middle
happened in our previous

00:39:41.726 --> 00:39:42.166 A:middle
example.

00:39:42.976 --> 00:39:45.186 A:middle
Here's a diagram of our app's

00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:45.796 A:middle
lifecycle.

00:39:47.196 --> 00:39:48.586 A:middle
We started off in the foreground

00:39:48.846 --> 00:39:49.946 A:middle
while we were editing the app

00:39:49.946 --> 00:39:52.436 A:middle
particle system, and we then

00:39:52.806 --> 00:39:54.286 A:middle
were taken to the background

00:39:54.466 --> 00:39:56.726 A:middle
when we used the App Switcher to

00:39:56.846 --> 00:39:57.726 A:middle
switch to Safari.

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.816 A:middle
The system suspended our app
