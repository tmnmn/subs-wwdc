00:35:59.996 --> 00:36:01.586 A:middle
First, we make the

00:36:01.586 --> 00:36:03.716 A:middle
startAccessing call on that URL,

00:36:04.256 --> 00:36:05.706 A:middle
and so we can start interacting

00:36:05.706 --> 00:36:06.376 A:middle
with that document.

00:36:07.386 --> 00:36:09.036 A:middle
And, you notice in the defer

00:36:09.036 --> 00:36:10.856 A:middle
block, we make the stopAccessing

00:36:10.856 --> 00:36:12.416 A:middle
call once we're done using the

00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:12.886 A:middle
document.

00:36:14.546 --> 00:36:16.576 A:middle
You notice that these calls are

00:36:16.576 --> 00:36:19.476 A:middle
balanced, and that we only call

00:36:19.476 --> 00:36:21.946 A:middle
stopAccessing if startAccessing

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:25.116 A:middle
returns "true."

00:36:25.336 --> 00:36:27.166 A:middle
We keep resource access time as

00:36:27.166 --> 00:36:29.426 A:middle
small as possible, because when

00:36:29.426 --> 00:36:30.826 A:middle
we make this startAccessing

00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:33.196 A:middle
call, we consume limited system

00:36:33.196 --> 00:36:34.916 A:middle
resources, reserved just for

00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:35.266 A:middle
your app.

00:36:35.806 --> 00:36:37.276 A:middle
And so, we need to relinquish

00:36:37.276 --> 00:36:39.136 A:middle
these resources once we're done

00:36:39.136 --> 00:36:40.696 A:middle
using that document to make sure

00:36:40.696 --> 00:36:43.066 A:middle
that we can access additional

00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:45.496 A:middle
documents within our process.

00:36:47.376 --> 00:36:49.116 A:middle
If you know for sure that this

00:36:49.116 --> 00:36:50.906 A:middle
document exists inside of your

00:36:50.906 --> 00:36:52.626 A:middle
app container, you do not need

00:36:52.626 --> 00:36:53.436 A:middle
to make these calls.

00:36:54.206 --> 00:36:56.376 A:middle
But, in case of doubt, make

00:36:56.376 --> 00:36:57.036 A:middle
these calls.

00:36:57.736 --> 00:36:59.196 A:middle
If they're not actually needed,

00:36:59.366 --> 00:37:01.126 A:middle
they'll simply be a no-op.
