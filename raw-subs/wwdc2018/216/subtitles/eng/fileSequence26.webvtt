00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:00.226 A:middle
And, I need to conform to

00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.196 A:middle
public.content either directly,

00:26:02.506 --> 00:26:03.786 A:middle
or indirectly through

00:26:03.786 --> 00:26:06.326 A:middle
public.spreadsheet or .image if

00:26:06.326 --> 00:26:07.956 A:middle
I want my files to show up in

00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:11.616 A:middle
Recents and in Search.

00:26:12.456 --> 00:26:13.766 A:middle
Then you have a second tree,

00:26:14.166 --> 00:26:15.446 A:middle
which we call the physical tree,

00:26:16.046 --> 00:26:17.706 A:middle
which lets iOS know how the

00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:19.316 A:middle
files are represented on-disk.

00:26:20.216 --> 00:26:21.706 A:middle
And, here this is much simpler,

00:26:22.036 --> 00:26:23.556 A:middle
because you only have two

00:26:23.556 --> 00:26:23.926 A:middle
choices.

00:26:25.406 --> 00:26:27.556 A:middle
In most cases, you will be

00:26:27.556 --> 00:26:29.286 A:middle
dealing with a single file on

00:26:29.286 --> 00:26:31.496 A:middle
disk for your document.

00:26:32.136 --> 00:26:35.956 A:middle
If you need to group multiple

00:26:35.956 --> 00:26:38.446 A:middle
resources together, and you have

00:26:38.446 --> 00:26:40.446 A:middle
the file package, you're going

00:26:40.446 --> 00:26:42.006 A:middle
to use com.apple.package.

00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:43.536 A:middle
But, in most cases, you have a

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:44.576 A:middle
single file disk, so it's

00:26:44.576 --> 00:26:45.926 A:middle
public.data.

00:26:47.656 --> 00:26:49.146 A:middle
This is because I am in with

00:26:49.186 --> 00:26:50.846 A:middle
particles, so I'm going to

00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:52.156 A:middle
conform to public.data.

00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:55.936 A:middle
Now, because this is a tree,

00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:58.666 A:middle
.data and .package both iterate

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
from our root type from the
