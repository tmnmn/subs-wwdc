00:32:58.816 --> 00:33:00.906 A:middle
copies in import mode that

00:33:00.906 --> 00:33:03.236 A:middle
Thomas has described, or if you

00:33:03.296 --> 00:33:04.506 A:middle
want to edit your document

00:33:04.506 --> 00:33:04.956 A:middle
directly.

00:33:05.376 --> 00:33:06.816 A:middle
For this you'd need to invoke

00:33:06.816 --> 00:33:08.076 A:middle
the Picker in Open Mode.

00:33:09.536 --> 00:33:11.096 A:middle
In this example, we're in the

00:33:11.096 --> 00:33:13.476 A:middle
Particles app, and we've created

00:33:13.476 --> 00:33:15.476 A:middle
and presented a Picker in Open

00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:15.726 A:middle
Mode.

00:33:16.366 --> 00:33:17.616 A:middle
We're going to pick an image

00:33:17.616 --> 00:33:19.146 A:middle
file to change our particle

00:33:19.146 --> 00:33:19.936 A:middle
system's image.

00:33:21.436 --> 00:33:23.936 A:middle
Once we've picked a document, we

00:33:23.936 --> 00:33:25.406 A:middle
receive a callback at one of

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:26.686 A:middle
these two delegate methods.

00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:29.616 A:middle
The first one, if we're picking

00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:32.126 A:middle
our document in the Browser, or

00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:34.216 A:middle
the second one if we're picking

00:33:34.216 --> 00:33:35.916 A:middle
it in the Picker, like our

00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:36.326 A:middle
example.

00:33:36.326 --> 00:33:40.716 A:middle
We see the document here, and we

00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:43.466 A:middle
see actually the Document Picker

00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:46.076 A:middle
here, serving our app the URL

00:33:46.076 --> 00:33:46.956 A:middle
that we've just picked.

00:33:48.066 --> 00:33:50.036 A:middle
If we attempt to access the

00:33:50.036 --> 00:33:52.536 A:middle
document directly, we risk

00:33:52.536 --> 00:33:53.756 A:middle
running into a permissions

00:33:53.756 --> 00:33:53.976 A:middle
error.

00:33:55.356 --> 00:33:57.036 A:middle
Let's try to understand why this

00:33:57.036 --> 00:33:57.546 A:middle
could happen.

00:33:58.546 --> 00:34:00.376 A:middle
As you may know, your apps on
