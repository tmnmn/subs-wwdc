00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.816 A:middle
The system suspended our app

00:40:00.816 --> 00:40:01.906 A:middle
while it was in the background.

00:40:02.716 --> 00:40:04.486 A:middle
It turns out that at the time,

00:40:04.716 --> 00:40:06.236 A:middle
our system was under some memory

00:40:06.236 --> 00:40:08.126 A:middle
pressure, and so the system

00:40:08.586 --> 00:40:09.566 A:middle
terminated our app.

00:40:10.776 --> 00:40:12.866 A:middle
When we used the App Switcher to

00:40:12.866 --> 00:40:14.866 A:middle
switch back to our app, our app

00:40:14.866 --> 00:40:15.546 A:middle
was relaunched.

00:40:16.246 --> 00:40:18.046 A:middle
What we failed to do here was

00:40:18.046 --> 00:40:19.176 A:middle
restore the UI state.

00:40:19.726 --> 00:40:21.196 A:middle
And, that time was a good time

00:40:21.196 --> 00:40:22.956 A:middle
to restore the UI state, to

00:40:22.956 --> 00:40:24.386 A:middle
bring back our customer to where

00:40:24.386 --> 00:40:24.736 A:middle
they were.

00:40:26.206 --> 00:40:28.116 A:middle
So, how do we implement state

00:40:28.116 --> 00:40:28.736 A:middle
restoration?

00:40:29.136 --> 00:40:31.266 A:middle
A simple and easy way would be

00:40:31.266 --> 00:40:32.686 A:middle
to persist the URL we've

00:40:32.726 --> 00:40:34.146 A:middle
received from the Document

00:40:34.146 --> 00:40:35.726 A:middle
Browser, or the Document Picker,

00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:37.856 A:middle
and restore it at app relaunch.

00:40:39.246 --> 00:40:40.846 A:middle
That wouldn't work though, for

00:40:40.846 --> 00:40:41.586 A:middle
two reasons.

00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:44.856 A:middle
First, the document that the URL

00:40:44.926 --> 00:40:46.726 A:middle
points to could have been moved

00:40:46.726 --> 00:40:47.306 A:middle
or renamed.

00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:48.826 A:middle
And so, we'd end up with a

00:40:48.826 --> 00:40:50.406 A:middle
broken link at app relaunch.

00:40:51.266 --> 00:40:53.286 A:middle
And second, the security scoped

00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:55.436 A:middle
resource that is attached to our

00:40:55.436 --> 00:40:58.436 A:middle
URL is not encoded when that URL

00:40:58.436 --> 00:40:59.166 A:middle
is persistent.

00:40:59.866 --> 00:41:01.446 A:middle
And so, when we relaunch our
