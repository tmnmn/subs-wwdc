00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:00.506 A:middle
your app to instruct the system

00:38:00.586 --> 00:38:02.576 A:middle
to download this document if

00:38:02.576 --> 00:38:03.886 A:middle
it's not available locally.

00:38:04.146 --> 00:38:05.856 A:middle
Because as you may know, a lot

00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:07.306 A:middle
of these documents could be in

00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:08.606 A:middle
the cloud, and not on the

00:38:08.606 --> 00:38:09.136 A:middle
device.

00:38:10.896 --> 00:38:12.566 A:middle
So, you might find yourself

00:38:12.566 --> 00:38:14.496 A:middle
writing a lot of boilerplate and

00:38:14.496 --> 00:38:16.056 A:middle
error-prone code to handle

00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:17.896 A:middle
sandboxing, to handle file

00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:18.756 A:middle
coordination.

00:38:19.846 --> 00:38:21.556 A:middle
If you're simply interested in

00:38:21.976 --> 00:38:23.456 A:middle
displaying and editing your

00:38:23.456 --> 00:38:25.456 A:middle
documents, the solution is much

00:38:25.456 --> 00:38:25.936 A:middle
simpler.

00:38:26.176 --> 00:38:27.986 A:middle
And, on iOS, it comes in the

00:38:27.986 --> 00:38:29.376 A:middle
form of UIDocument.

00:38:30.346 --> 00:38:32.006 A:middle
UIDocument has been available

00:38:32.006 --> 00:38:32.956 A:middle
since iOS 5.

00:38:33.946 --> 00:38:36.016 A:middle
It is the recommended way for

00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:37.576 A:middle
your app to display and edit

00:38:37.576 --> 00:38:38.246 A:middle
documents.

00:38:39.256 --> 00:38:40.946 A:middle
It handles sandboxing for you,

00:38:41.256 --> 00:38:42.666 A:middle
so there's no need to make the

00:38:42.666 --> 00:38:44.466 A:middle
start- and stopAccessing calls.

00:38:45.336 --> 00:38:46.696 A:middle
And, it handles file

00:38:46.696 --> 00:38:47.736 A:middle
coordination for you.

00:38:47.986 --> 00:38:49.246 A:middle
So, there's no need for you to

00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.896 A:middle
manually coordinate access to

00:38:50.896 --> 00:38:51.706 A:middle
these documents.

00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:55.646 A:middle
For more information on file

00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:58.186 A:middle
coordination and UIDocument, we
