00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:01.516 A:middle
So, here I have a new item, of

00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:01.996 A:middle
particles.

00:28:02.656 --> 00:28:06.396 A:middle
And, with this, our declaration

00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:07.286 A:middle
is done.

00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:11.176 A:middle
There's just one more thing I

00:28:11.176 --> 00:28:11.876 A:middle
didn't mention.

00:28:12.406 --> 00:28:15.786 A:middle
It is if you-- if this was the

00:28:15.786 --> 00:28:18.466 A:middle
case where we were declaring our

00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:19.056 A:middle
own type.

00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:21.026 A:middle
But, you might also want to use

00:28:21.026 --> 00:28:22.306 A:middle
type defined by another

00:28:22.306 --> 00:28:22.926 A:middle
application.

00:28:23.476 --> 00:28:26.286 A:middle
If that is the case, you also

00:28:26.286 --> 00:28:28.616 A:middle
need to declare the type so that

00:28:28.616 --> 00:28:30.706 A:middle
iOS knows about it, in case that

00:28:30.706 --> 00:28:31.596 A:middle
app is not [inaudible].

00:28:32.486 --> 00:28:34.486 A:middle
And, because this is an imported

00:28:34.636 --> 00:28:39.096 A:middle
type declaration, this means

00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:41.856 A:middle
that if iOS finds an extra

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:42.956 A:middle
definition of that type

00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:44.856 A:middle
somewhere else, it will prefer

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.366 A:middle
that definition over yours.

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:48.826 A:middle
This is also what you need to do

00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:50.606 A:middle
if you want to use a common file

00:28:50.606 --> 00:28:52.456 A:middle
type which is not declared by

00:28:52.456 --> 00:28:53.396 A:middle
iOS yet.

00:28:54.536 --> 00:28:55.736 A:middle
Now, do not freak out, it is the

00:28:55.736 --> 00:28:58.976 A:middle
same UI as what we've just went

00:28:58.976 --> 00:29:02.136 A:middle
through, except that it is in
