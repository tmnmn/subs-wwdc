00:46:00.856 --> 00:46:03.106 A:middle
What this means is as soon as we

00:46:03.106 --> 00:46:04.726 A:middle
tap on our app icon in the Share

00:46:04.726 --> 00:46:06.456 A:middle
sheet, the system will make a

00:46:06.456 --> 00:46:09.096 A:middle
copy of this document, and serve

00:46:09.096 --> 00:46:10.986 A:middle
this copy to our app.

00:46:10.986 --> 00:46:12.596 A:middle
And, practically this means that

00:46:12.596 --> 00:46:14.326 A:middle
the customer would start editing

00:46:14.326 --> 00:46:15.616 A:middle
a copy of the document.

00:46:17.096 --> 00:46:19.056 A:middle
To allow your customers to open

00:46:19.056 --> 00:46:20.816 A:middle
and edit the original document

00:46:21.756 --> 00:46:23.696 A:middle
that we wish to access in your

00:46:23.696 --> 00:46:26.206 A:middle
app, you need to adopt an iOS

00:46:26.206 --> 00:46:28.106 A:middle
feature called Open in Place.

00:46:28.636 --> 00:46:32.066 A:middle
If you do adopt Open in Place,

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.276 A:middle
you see the "Open in" your app

00:46:34.536 --> 00:46:35.856 A:middle
in the Share sheet, instead of

00:46:35.856 --> 00:46:38.576 A:middle
the previous "Copy to."

00:46:38.826 --> 00:46:40.676 A:middle
Adopting Open in Place is very

00:46:40.676 --> 00:46:41.076 A:middle
simple.

00:46:41.816 --> 00:46:43.676 A:middle
If you use the document-based

00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:45.586 A:middle
app Xcode template, you'll get

00:46:45.586 --> 00:46:47.656 A:middle
this behavior for free, as Open

00:46:47.656 --> 00:46:49.286 A:middle
in Place is already enabled by

00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:49.856 A:middle
default there.

00:46:50.876 --> 00:46:52.676 A:middle
Otherwise, you'll need to add

00:46:52.756 --> 00:46:52.966 A:middle
the

00:46:52.966 --> 00:46:55.026 A:middle
LSSupportsOpeningDocumentInPlace

00:46:55.026 --> 00:46:57.756 A:middle
to your info.plist.

00:46:57.756 --> 00:46:58.806 A:middle
Once you've declared to the

00:46:58.806 --> 00:47:00.956 A:middle
system that your app handles
