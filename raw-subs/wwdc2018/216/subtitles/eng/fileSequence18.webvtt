00:18:00.086 --> 00:18:02.386 A:middle
So, they've asked the designers

00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:03.926 A:middle
to design some better-looking

00:18:03.976 --> 00:18:05.586 A:middle
particle images, and the

00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:07.336 A:middle
designers have shared these

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.476 A:middle
images over iCloud.

00:18:09.346 --> 00:18:11.456 A:middle
So, how do we get these images

00:18:11.746 --> 00:18:12.496 A:middle
to customize them?

00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:15.726 A:middle
What we're going to do, is add a

00:18:15.726 --> 00:18:17.146 A:middle
Choose Image button in the

00:18:17.146 --> 00:18:19.866 A:middle
navigation bar here to pick a

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:22.546 A:middle
file from iCloud, and customize

00:18:22.816 --> 00:18:23.496 A:middle
these particles.

00:18:25.196 --> 00:18:26.476 A:middle
So, you can open your

00:18:26.476 --> 00:18:29.246 A:middle
storyboard, and here I am

00:18:29.246 --> 00:18:29.946 A:middle
[inaudible] the controller.

00:18:30.836 --> 00:18:32.306 A:middle
I'm going to drag a new bar

00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:34.966 A:middle
button item to that editor.

00:18:40.616 --> 00:18:43.896 A:middle
And, I'm going to animate Choose

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:44.846 A:middle
Image.

00:18:51.156 --> 00:18:51.526 A:middle
[inaudible] Choose Image.

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:54.586 A:middle
OK. Now, I get to write some

00:18:55.066 --> 00:18:59.206 A:middle
code to present to the document

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
picker of the controller.
