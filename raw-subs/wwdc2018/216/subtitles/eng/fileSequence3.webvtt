00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.256 A:middle
Controllers, under the Locations

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:01.616 A:middle
tab-- under the Locations

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:01.896 A:middle
section.

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:06.526 A:middle
Also, because sign-in is

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:07.746 A:middle
implemented using FPUI

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:09.596 A:middle
ActionExtensionViewController,

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:11.646 A:middle
you'll want to use this so you

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:12.646 A:middle
can reduce friction for your

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:14.306 A:middle
customers by making logging into

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:15.206 A:middle
your service easier.

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:17.206 A:middle
Let's go through a few examples

00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:19.696 A:middle
of that.

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:23.126 A:middle
First, in this example, what you

00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:24.136 A:middle
can do-- or, what the user is

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:25.796 A:middle
able to do, is sign into their

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:27.016 A:middle
service, without being

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:28.286 A:middle
interrupted from their workflow.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:29.196 A:middle
They don't have to leave the

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:29.456 A:middle
app.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.566 A:middle
They can just sign in and

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:31.616 A:middle
continue going along their

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:32.326 A:middle
business.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:35.056 A:middle
An example of what to try and

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:37.066 A:middle
avoid, would be something like

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.096 A:middle
this, where there's redundant UI

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:40.576 A:middle
elements or branding onscreen.

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:41.766 A:middle
You can see the example of two

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.516 A:middle
nav bars, or two Cancel buttons.

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
And, another example to try and

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.906 A:middle
avoid, is having a simple Sign

00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:50.616 A:middle
In button, where all it does is

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.186 A:middle
launch to your application.

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.116 A:middle
This interrupts the customer's

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:54.656 A:middle
workflow.

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:58.256 A:middle
So, try to avoid doing that.

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
Lastly, we've seen great
