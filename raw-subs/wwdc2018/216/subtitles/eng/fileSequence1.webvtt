00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.136 A:middle
and tricks for raising the bar

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
in your application.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.385 A:middle
So, let's get started with a

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:05.686 A:middle
refresher about what document

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:07.026 A:middle
management on iOS is.

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:09.206 A:middle
It's a collection of

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:10.096 A:middle
technologies.

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:11.846 A:middle
First, there's an API for

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:13.056 A:middle
application developers.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:15.206 A:middle
For cloud vendors, there's also

00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:16.286 A:middle
the File Provider API.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:19.406 A:middle
And, there's also the Files app.

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:22.976 A:middle
In iOS 11, we introduced

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.766 A:middle
UIDocumentBrowserViewController.

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:26.686 A:middle
And, also significantly revamped

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:28.266 A:middle
UIDocumentPickerViewController.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.406 A:middle
Using this new controller in

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.776 A:middle
your app, your customers will be

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:35.186 A:middle
able to manage and browse their

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.716 A:middle
files from all of their favorite

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:37.466 A:middle
cloud vendors.

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:39.836 A:middle
There's also powerful Search

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:41.146 A:middle
that searches across all of

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:42.046 A:middle
these cloud vendors.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.236 A:middle
They'll be able to favorite

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:46.276 A:middle
Folders, and those favorite

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:47.036 A:middle
Folders will appear in the

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:47.586 A:middle
sidebar.

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:49.966 A:middle
And, they'll be able to organize

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.946 A:middle
their files using Tags.

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.196 A:middle
Recently used files also appear

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:55.946 A:middle
in the Recents tab.
