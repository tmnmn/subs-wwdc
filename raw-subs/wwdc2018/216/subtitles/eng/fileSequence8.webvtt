00:07:58.536 --> 00:08:01.686 A:middle
Document Browser are, when and

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:02.476 A:middle
how to use them.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.356 A:middle
Then, we'll add a document

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:06.786 A:middle
picker to our demo app,

00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:07.676 A:middle
Particles.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:11.266 A:middle
And, finally, we talk about

00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:13.016 A:middle
document types, and how to

00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:14.376 A:middle
configure them properly in

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:14.696 A:middle
Xcode.

00:08:17.256 --> 00:08:18.936 A:middle
So, what does interacting with

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:21.146 A:middle
documents mean nowadays?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.766 A:middle
Of course, it means that you

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:26.926 A:middle
need to provide UI to let your

00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:28.816 A:middle
customers organize their

00:08:28.816 --> 00:08:29.356 A:middle
documents.

00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:31.816 A:middle
Starting with the ones in your

00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:32.246 A:middle
app container.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.846 A:middle
But, because most documents are

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:38.265 A:middle
in the cloud nowadays, it means

00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:39.556 A:middle
that you need to let them access

00:08:39.556 --> 00:08:41.246 A:middle
documents stored in the cloud,

00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:43.946 A:middle
and in other apps.

00:08:44.876 --> 00:08:47.346 A:middle
How do you do this?

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.026 A:middle
Well, we have two solutions for

00:08:50.026 --> 00:08:50.196 A:middle
you.

00:08:50.966 --> 00:08:53.336 A:middle
The Document Picker and the

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:55.136 A:middle
Document Browser.

00:08:55.246 --> 00:08:56.936 A:middle
What are the differences between

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:57.936 A:middle
these two?

00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:02.956 A:middle
Well, both let you browse files
