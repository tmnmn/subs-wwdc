00:20:59.446 --> 00:21:01.136 A:middle
And, as you see, again, we have

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:02.006 A:middle
all the pictures of the Files

00:21:02.006 --> 00:21:02.296 A:middle
app.

00:21:02.296 --> 00:21:03.286 A:middle
We can search our files, you

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:03.926 A:middle
have Tags.

00:21:04.256 --> 00:21:06.476 A:middle
You can browse.

00:21:06.476 --> 00:21:07.696 A:middle
All of this comes for free.

00:21:09.266 --> 00:21:12.146 A:middle
Now, my particle image is

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:13.066 A:middle
[inaudible] shared to me over

00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:14.576 A:middle
iCloud, so they show up in

00:21:14.576 --> 00:21:15.536 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:21:15.536 --> 00:21:17.686 A:middle
And, again, use this little star

00:21:17.686 --> 00:21:18.166 A:middle
image here.

00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:21.376 A:middle
Pick it, and my particles are

00:21:21.376 --> 00:21:21.976 A:middle
little stars.

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:28.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:29.116 --> 00:21:30.126 A:middle
This was easy.

00:21:30.736 --> 00:21:32.646 A:middle
And, when you are back at work,

00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:33.816 A:middle
you will be able to add a

00:21:33.816 --> 00:21:36.136 A:middle
Document Picker to your app in

00:21:36.136 --> 00:21:36.796 A:middle
no time.

00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:39.836 A:middle
It simply has very little code,

00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:41.806 A:middle
and does not depend on any

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:42.736 A:middle
third-party library.

00:21:43.576 --> 00:21:45.416 A:middle
Your customers simply get access

00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:47.356 A:middle
to their files, no matter where

00:21:47.356 --> 00:21:47.916 A:middle
they are stored.

00:21:48.446 --> 00:21:51.116 A:middle
Now, you noticed that during the

00:21:51.116 --> 00:21:52.996 A:middle
demo, we have again talked about

00:21:52.996 --> 00:21:53.536 A:middle
file types.

00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:55.596 A:middle
And, many among you probably

00:21:55.596 --> 00:21:56.866 A:middle
don't know what these are.

00:21:57.246 --> 00:22:01.296 A:middle
So, let's talk about file types.
