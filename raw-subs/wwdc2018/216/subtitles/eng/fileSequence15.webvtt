00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:01.056 A:middle
And, by default, you do not add

00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:03.576 A:middle
access to these.

00:15:03.796 --> 00:15:06.226 A:middle
So, you need something to let

00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:08.586 A:middle
you access, copy, and move

00:15:08.586 --> 00:15:10.236 A:middle
documents between these

00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:13.186 A:middle
locations, and this is what the

00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:16.986 A:middle
Document Picker does.

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:19.676 A:middle
It goes away once the files get

00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:21.756 A:middle
chosen, so if you want something

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:23.566 A:middle
which stays onscreen for a long

00:15:23.566 --> 00:15:24.986 A:middle
time, you should check out

00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:25.916 A:middle
Document Browser instead.

00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:32.916 A:middle
What can you do with Document

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:33.136 A:middle
Picker?

00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:35.156 A:middle
You can use it for multiple

00:15:35.156 --> 00:15:35.466 A:middle
things.

00:15:36.346 --> 00:15:38.216 A:middle
You can use it to access files

00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:39.466 A:middle
in the cloud directly.

00:15:42.536 --> 00:15:45.646 A:middle
Now, creating copies, you can

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:50.106 A:middle
use it to move files to the

00:15:50.106 --> 00:15:52.366 A:middle
cloud to implement a safety

00:15:52.366 --> 00:15:52.956 A:middle
cloud feature.

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:56.556 A:middle
And, getting copies of documents

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:59.106 A:middle
is often confusing, but if you

00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:00.896 A:middle
really want to, you can use it
