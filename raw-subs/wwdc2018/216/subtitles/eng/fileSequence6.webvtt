00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:00.736 A:middle
You'll also be able to-- your

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:01.796 A:middle
customer will also be able to

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:04.076 A:middle
make shortcuts that are synced

00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:05.096 A:middle
across devices.

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:06.436 A:middle
And, it's important to note that

00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:07.686 A:middle
they're synced across devices,

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:10.526 A:middle
because in order to support

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:12.396 A:middle
this, your file provider will

00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:14.376 A:middle
need to use unique identifiers

00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:16.656 A:middle
for each file across all of the

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:18.616 A:middle
devices for a given customer.

00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:21.266 A:middle
If this is true, or you can make

00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:22.976 A:middle
this happen, all you need to do

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:24.456 A:middle
to support Siri shortcuts in

00:06:24.456 --> 00:06:26.366 A:middle
your file provider extension is

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:27.986 A:middle
to add NSFileProvider

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:30.136 A:middle
UsesUniqueItemIdentifiers

00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:32.296 A:middle
AcrossDevices to your file

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:34.076 A:middle
provider extension's info.plist

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
file.

00:06:35.126 --> 00:06:36.026 A:middle
Once you've done that, and

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.646 A:middle
submitted to the Store, you're

00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:37.846 A:middle
done.

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:40.476 A:middle
For application developers,

00:06:40.476 --> 00:06:41.416 A:middle
there's nothing you need to do.

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:44.196 A:middle
For information about Siri

00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:45.736 A:middle
shortcuts, check out yesterday's

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:47.246 A:middle
session, "Introduction to Siri

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:47.836 A:middle
Shortcuts."

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:54.176 A:middle
Also this year, we're happy to

00:06:54.176 --> 00:06:55.256 A:middle
announce that we're releasing

00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:56.426 A:middle
the Particle Sample app.

00:06:57.206 --> 00:06:58.196 A:middle
This was sample code that we

00:06:58.196 --> 00:06:59.516 A:middle
used in last year's session to

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:00.516 A:middle
demonstrate how to use
