00:27:58.926 --> 00:28:01.016 A:middle
The first thing they need is a

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:01.766 A:middle
destination.

00:28:02.486 --> 00:28:03.516 A:middle
This could be something that is

00:28:03.656 --> 00:28:05.146 A:middle
surfaced by your app through a

00:28:05.146 --> 00:28:05.986 A:middle
navigation alert.

00:28:06.786 --> 00:28:07.626 A:middle
Or perhaps, they've done a

00:28:07.626 --> 00:28:09.096 A:middle
search and found a destination

00:28:09.096 --> 00:28:09.876 A:middle
they want to travel to.

00:28:11.136 --> 00:28:12.606 A:middle
They may want to, then, preview

00:28:12.606 --> 00:28:13.686 A:middle
the route and see important

00:28:13.686 --> 00:28:14.926 A:middle
information about it, such as

00:28:15.136 --> 00:28:16.416 A:middle
how long it might take to get

00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:17.806 A:middle
there and what their estimated

00:28:17.806 --> 00:28:18.556 A:middle
arrival time is.

00:28:19.636 --> 00:28:20.806 A:middle
If there are multiple route

00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:21.866 A:middle
choices for the trip they're

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.436 A:middle
about to take they'll probably

00:28:23.436 --> 00:28:24.566 A:middle
want to preview each of those

00:28:24.566 --> 00:28:26.116 A:middle
routes and make a choice that

00:28:26.116 --> 00:28:26.826 A:middle
suits them best.

00:28:28.176 --> 00:28:29.746 A:middle
They'll then select a route and

00:28:29.746 --> 00:28:30.796 A:middle
begin navigation.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.176 A:middle
This is when your app will begin

00:28:33.176 --> 00:28:35.066 A:middle
providing turn by turn updates

00:28:35.106 --> 00:28:35.606 A:middle
to the user.

00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:38.096 A:middle
Eventually, they'll arrive at

00:28:38.096 --> 00:28:39.686 A:middle
their destination or cancel

00:28:39.686 --> 00:28:40.246 A:middle
navigation.

00:28:41.356 --> 00:28:42.496 A:middle
And let's take a look at how you

00:28:42.496 --> 00:28:44.206 A:middle
can accomplish this same flow

00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:45.686 A:middle
using the CarPlay framework.

00:28:46.146 --> 00:28:48.316 A:middle
Let's start by talking about

00:28:48.316 --> 00:28:49.096 A:middle
Route Preview.

00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:51.666 A:middle
Your app can provide data that

00:28:52.226 --> 00:28:53.656 A:middle
will appear in a way that the

00:28:53.656 --> 00:28:56.776 A:middle
user can see and visualize all

00:28:56.776 --> 00:28:57.746 A:middle
the important details about

00:28:57.746 --> 00:28:58.556 A:middle
their upcoming trip.

00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:01.596 A:middle
You can provide destination
