00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:00.876 A:middle
your information on somewhere in

00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:01.196 A:middle
your app.

00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:02.536 A:middle
So, then that when we ask for

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:03.766 A:middle
your content information you're

00:11:03.766 --> 00:11:05.206 A:middle
able to provide us information

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.826 A:middle
quickly and makes your app

00:11:06.826 --> 00:11:07.406 A:middle
responsive.

00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:10.416 A:middle
Next, let's discuss some ways to

00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:12.036 A:middle
further optimize your audio

00:11:12.036 --> 00:11:13.136 A:middle
app's performance in CarPlay.

00:11:14.426 --> 00:11:16.456 A:middle
So, Srirocka, already, has a bit

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:17.626 A:middle
of an implementation and is

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:18.556 A:middle
partially implemented.

00:11:18.556 --> 00:11:19.986 A:middle
And the user has decided to make

00:11:19.986 --> 00:11:21.386 A:middle
a selection on the Heating

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:22.486 A:middle
Habaneros playlist.

00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:24.666 A:middle
It is one of the top playlists

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:25.426 A:middle
that's super-hot.

00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:28.246 A:middle
But it seems to be stuck

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:28.616 A:middle
loading.

00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:29.676 A:middle
We're not entirely sure what's

00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:30.346 A:middle
going on, here.

00:11:30.716 --> 00:11:32.046 A:middle
And CarPlay, actually, will

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:33.486 A:middle
timeout if the app doesn't

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:34.646 A:middle
provide content in time.

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:35.796 A:middle
Because it doesn't call

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:36.856 A:middle
completion handlers or just

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:37.906 A:middle
simply isn't returning its

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:38.496 A:middle
information.

00:11:38.716 --> 00:11:40.486 A:middle
But what's going on, on the

00:11:40.486 --> 00:11:41.016 A:middle
phone, here?

00:11:42.266 --> 00:11:44.166 A:middle
So, CarPlay users are, usually,

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:46.066 A:middle
driving in areas where there's

00:11:46.066 --> 00:11:47.986 A:middle
not a speedy connection or their

00:11:47.986 --> 00:11:48.716 A:middle
screen is locked.

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:50.666 A:middle
A vast majority of CarPlay users

00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:51.716 A:middle
are driving with the screen

00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:52.776 A:middle
locked and with a passcode.

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:53.986 A:middle
After all, they're driving.

00:11:55.456 --> 00:11:57.016 A:middle
If your app has data protection

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.466 A:middle
policies that are dependent on

00:11:58.466 --> 00:12:00.256 A:middle
the phone being unlocked, you
