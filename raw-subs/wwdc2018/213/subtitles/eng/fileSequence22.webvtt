00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:01.476 A:middle
And then, return our map

00:22:01.476 --> 00:22:01.856 A:middle
template.

00:22:02.606 --> 00:22:03.786 A:middle
Great. Now, that we have a

00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:05.746 A:middle
button on our map template, we

00:22:05.746 --> 00:22:07.106 A:middle
want a way to display those

00:22:07.106 --> 00:22:08.006 A:middle
favorite categories to our

00:22:08.006 --> 00:22:08.466 A:middle
users.

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:10.206 A:middle
The CarPlay framework has a

00:22:10.206 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
great template for this.

00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:12.896 A:middle
And that is the grid template.

00:22:13.556 --> 00:22:15.176 A:middle
The grid template will display

00:22:15.176 --> 00:22:17.276 A:middle
an array of up to eight buttons

00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:18.456 A:middle
in a grid format.

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:22.036 A:middle
These buttons appear here and

00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:23.526 A:middle
can be configured with an image

00:22:23.636 --> 00:22:24.506 A:middle
and a title.

00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:27.246 A:middle
The grid template also has a

00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:28.586 A:middle
navigation bar, where you can

00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:29.906 A:middle
place the same leading and

00:22:29.906 --> 00:22:30.716 A:middle
trailing buttons.

00:22:31.186 --> 00:22:32.256 A:middle
But you can also create a grid

00:22:32.256 --> 00:22:34.126 A:middle
template with a title that will

00:22:34.126 --> 00:22:35.346 A:middle
appear in the navigation bar.

00:22:36.556 --> 00:22:37.756 A:middle
Let's jump over the code and

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:39.366 A:middle
let's create a grid template.

00:22:41.476 --> 00:22:43.006 A:middle
We'll start by retrieving an

00:22:43.006 --> 00:22:44.656 A:middle
image for our grid button.

00:22:45.506 --> 00:22:47.266 A:middle
We're going to add a Parks

00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:48.526 A:middle
button.

00:22:48.676 --> 00:22:49.756 A:middle
We'll then create an instance of

00:22:49.816 --> 00:22:51.536 A:middle
CPGridButton with a title of

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.286 A:middle
Parks and the image we just

00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:53.706 A:middle
retrieved.

00:22:55.276 --> 00:22:56.706 A:middle
That, with the other buttons,

00:22:56.706 --> 00:22:58.166 A:middle
we'll assign to an array.

00:22:58.376 --> 00:22:59.556 A:middle
And then, create an instance of

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.926 A:middle
CPGridTemplate with a title of
