00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:00.196 A:middle
screen sizes, and so on.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:02.426 A:middle
So, your audio app just needs to

00:07:02.426 --> 00:07:04.036 A:middle
be able to display information

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:05.766 A:middle
onto the CarPlay display and

00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:06.916 A:middle
provide the best content.

00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:09.076 A:middle
This is, usually, done by using

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:10.956 A:middle
a table view or tabs, depending

00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:12.216 A:middle
on how you want to present your

00:07:12.216 --> 00:07:12.566 A:middle
data.

00:07:13.826 --> 00:07:14.676 A:middle
You'll need to focus on

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:15.546 A:middle
delivering the appropriate

00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:16.916 A:middle
content to a CarPlay user.

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:18.636 A:middle
And if you're already developing

00:07:18.636 --> 00:07:20.516 A:middle
an audio app, it uses existing

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:21.906 A:middle
APIs you may be already familiar

00:07:21.906 --> 00:07:22.136 A:middle
with.

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:24.916 A:middle
So, let's take a look at this in

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:26.226 A:middle
detail.

00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:27.726 A:middle
So, these are the three APIs

00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:28.966 A:middle
that you'll need to know to

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:30.606 A:middle
launch your app in CarPlay.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.626 A:middle
If you want to learn more about

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:34.366 A:middle
this in detail, we had a session

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:35.476 A:middle
last year that goes through the

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:36.956 A:middle
details of each single API.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.146 A:middle
But I'll go through a brief

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:39.346 A:middle
summary of every single one of

00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:39.636 A:middle
these.

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:42.036 A:middle
To browse your content on the

00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:43.496 A:middle
CarPlay display, you'll need to

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.936 A:middle
use MPPlayableContent.

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:47.366 A:middle
MPPlayableContent has a data

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.946 A:middle
source and a delegate, so that

00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:50.226 A:middle
you or your audio app can

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:51.826 A:middle
populate your app's information

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.056 A:middle
onto the CarPlay display.

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:55.086 A:middle
As well as a delegate to receive

00:07:55.086 --> 00:07:56.426 A:middle
callbacks whenever the user

00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:57.586 A:middle
selects something on the CarPlay

00:07:57.586 --> 00:07:58.046 A:middle
display.

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:00.996 A:middle
Now, if you already set Now
