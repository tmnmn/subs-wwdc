00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:01.136 A:middle
your audio plays well with other

00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:02.146 A:middle
iOS audio sources.

00:33:03.346 --> 00:33:04.526 A:middle
So, what happens next?

00:33:04.996 --> 00:33:06.586 A:middle
Well, your users will continue

00:33:06.586 --> 00:33:07.106 A:middle
to drive.

00:33:08.066 --> 00:33:08.956 A:middle
You'll want to continue to

00:33:08.956 --> 00:33:10.746 A:middle
provide updated maneuvers and

00:33:10.746 --> 00:33:12.276 A:middle
estimates and help them make

00:33:12.276 --> 00:33:15.656 A:middle
those turns when they need to.

00:33:15.886 --> 00:33:16.916 A:middle
What happens if they veer off

00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:17.176 A:middle
route?

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:18.976 A:middle
Well, you might want to

00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:20.596 A:middle
calculate a new route.

00:33:21.056 --> 00:33:22.496 A:middle
You can set a pause reason which

00:33:22.496 --> 00:33:23.946 A:middle
will display a rerouting status

00:33:23.946 --> 00:33:24.396 A:middle
to the user.

00:33:25.556 --> 00:33:26.646 A:middle
Perhaps, a new route is

00:33:26.646 --> 00:33:28.316 A:middle
available or something has

00:33:28.316 --> 00:33:29.346 A:middle
occurred along the route.

00:33:29.346 --> 00:33:30.326 A:middle
And you can use a navigation

00:33:30.326 --> 00:33:31.406 A:middle
alert to present that

00:33:31.406 --> 00:33:32.946 A:middle
information to them, right there

00:33:32.946 --> 00:33:33.706 A:middle
on the map template.

00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:36.716 A:middle
And ultimately, they'll arrive

00:33:36.716 --> 00:33:38.026 A:middle
at their destination, thanks to

00:33:38.026 --> 00:33:38.466 A:middle
your app.

00:33:39.696 --> 00:33:40.836 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about

00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:42.146 A:middle
what your apps can look like

00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:43.496 A:middle
while frontmost on the car

00:33:43.496 --> 00:33:43.886 A:middle
screen.

00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:45.946 A:middle
But we know that our users in

00:33:45.946 --> 00:33:47.716 A:middle
CarPlay often switch between

00:33:47.716 --> 00:33:49.546 A:middle
their mapping app and an audio

00:33:49.546 --> 00:33:50.916 A:middle
app, like our favorite audio app

00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:51.406 A:middle
Srirocka.

00:33:52.566 --> 00:33:53.506 A:middle
What happens when your app is

00:33:53.506 --> 00:33:54.646 A:middle
backgrounded and you need to

00:33:54.646 --> 00:33:55.996 A:middle
present important information to

00:33:55.996 --> 00:33:56.626 A:middle
your users?

00:33:57.576 --> 00:33:58.866 A:middle
You will have an opportunity to

00:33:58.866 --> 00:34:00.356 A:middle
provide banner notifications
