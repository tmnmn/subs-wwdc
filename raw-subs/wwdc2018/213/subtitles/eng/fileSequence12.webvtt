00:11:58.466 --> 00:12:00.256 A:middle
the phone being unlocked, you

00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:01.336 A:middle
won't be able to access your

00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:02.496 A:middle
app's information and,

00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:03.726 A:middle
ultimately, CarPlay will

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:04.226 A:middle
timeout.

00:12:04.676 --> 00:12:06.196 A:middle
So, if your data needs to be

00:12:06.196 --> 00:12:07.106 A:middle
accessed while the phone is

00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:08.536 A:middle
unlocked, you'll need to audit

00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:10.066 A:middle
your app's data intergradation

00:12:10.066 --> 00:12:10.616 A:middle
policies.

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:16.526 A:middle
The other issue is that you may

00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:18.246 A:middle
be driving in areas, or CarPlay

00:12:18.246 --> 00:12:19.686 A:middle
users are driving in areas with

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:20.756 A:middle
little to no cellular

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:21.406 A:middle
network-tivity [phonetic].

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:23.776 A:middle
Drivers are driving everywhere,

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.806 A:middle
from the country roads and rural

00:12:25.806 --> 00:12:27.146 A:middle
areas, to big cities.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:30.876 A:middle
And these are very varied areas

00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:31.976 A:middle
with different CarPlay,

00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:33.666 A:middle
different data service.

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:35.286 A:middle
And you need to test for

00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:36.476 A:middle
situations that are not just the

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:37.476 A:middle
constant WIFI network

00:12:37.476 --> 00:12:37.926 A:middle
connection.

00:12:39.086 --> 00:12:40.656 A:middle
Now, Srirocka does account for

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:41.546 A:middle
all of this, as well.

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.566 A:middle
But it uses some very advanced

00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:45.816 A:middle
machine learning to see what are

00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:46.686 A:middle
the hottest tracks.

00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:48.006 A:middle
And after all, all of this

00:12:48.006 --> 00:12:49.586 A:middle
happens on device, since privacy

00:12:49.586 --> 00:12:50.666 A:middle
is a very important issue.

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.056 A:middle
And this just takes some time to

00:12:52.056 --> 00:12:52.656 A:middle
process.

00:12:53.286 --> 00:12:54.516 A:middle
Well, what happens in this case?

00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:57.186 A:middle
We have an API called

00:12:57.266 --> 00:12:58.676 A:middle
beginLoadingChildItems at

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:00.546 A:middle
indexPath to initiate fetching
