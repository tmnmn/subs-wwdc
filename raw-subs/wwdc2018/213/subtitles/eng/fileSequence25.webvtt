00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:00.596 A:middle
framework presenting a

00:25:00.596 --> 00:25:01.806 A:middle
touchscreen keyboard.

00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:03.546 A:middle
But one thing we've learned is

00:25:03.546 --> 00:25:05.156 A:middle
that not all CarPlay systems

00:25:05.236 --> 00:25:06.016 A:middle
have a touchscreen.

00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:08.596 A:middle
Many only have a rotary knob or

00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:10.126 A:middle
touchpad for user interaction.

00:25:10.966 --> 00:25:11.956 A:middle
On those systems, when

00:25:11.956 --> 00:25:13.436 A:middle
appropriate, the CarPlay

00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:14.886 A:middle
framework will display a linear

00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:15.666 A:middle
style keyboard.

00:25:16.636 --> 00:25:17.616 A:middle
And of course, for those

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.716 A:middle
touchpads that do support

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:20.366 A:middle
character recognition, through

00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:21.776 A:middle
the same search template API

00:25:22.366 --> 00:25:23.856 A:middle
your app will receive those

00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:25.746 A:middle
characters as entered for free.

00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:28.246 A:middle
You may, also, want to present

00:25:28.246 --> 00:25:29.396 A:middle
information to your users in a

00:25:29.396 --> 00:25:30.856 A:middle
way that demands a little bit

00:25:30.856 --> 00:25:31.776 A:middle
more of their attention.

00:25:32.446 --> 00:25:33.666 A:middle
For that, you can present a

00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:36.656 A:middle
CPAlert in ActionSheetStyle or

00:25:36.656 --> 00:25:38.076 A:middle
for information that truly

00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:39.166 A:middle
commands their attention, you

00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:41.086 A:middle
can use a full screen template.

00:25:42.296 --> 00:25:44.646 A:middle
And lastly, since voice is such

00:25:44.646 --> 00:25:47.436 A:middle
a huge part of your apps, we'll

00:25:47.436 --> 00:25:48.996 A:middle
be providing a template that

00:25:48.996 --> 00:25:50.166 A:middle
will help you manage voice

00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:50.566 A:middle
control.

00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:52.416 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to

00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:53.646 A:middle
invite Jonathan back up to give

00:25:53.646 --> 00:25:55.056 A:middle
you a demo of our Country Roads

00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:55.226 A:middle
app.

00:25:55.656 --> 00:25:55.976 A:middle
Jonathan.

00:25:56.516 --> 00:26:00.500 A:middle
