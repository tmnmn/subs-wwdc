00:35:59.416 --> 00:36:00.356 A:middle
that CarPlay needs for

00:36:00.356 --> 00:36:01.006 A:middle
navigation.

00:36:01.486 --> 00:36:05.516 A:middle
When our user has selected a

00:36:05.516 --> 00:36:07.146 A:middle
route and started navigation,

00:36:07.316 --> 00:36:08.646 A:middle
first we can hide the route

00:36:08.696 --> 00:36:09.796 A:middle
previews that our user was

00:36:09.796 --> 00:36:10.266 A:middle
browsing.

00:36:10.956 --> 00:36:12.736 A:middle
We'll tell our map template to

00:36:12.736 --> 00:36:14.086 A:middle
start a navigation session.

00:36:14.446 --> 00:36:15.716 A:middle
And we can move the session to

00:36:15.716 --> 00:36:16.826 A:middle
the loading state while we're

00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:17.986 A:middle
calculating maneuvers.

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.096 A:middle
We'll build a list of CP

00:36:20.096 --> 00:36:21.876 A:middle
maneuver objects from our

00:36:21.876 --> 00:36:22.856 A:middle
navigation engine.

00:36:23.206 --> 00:36:24.786 A:middle
And last but not least, we'll

00:36:24.786 --> 00:36:26.606 A:middle
provide the first instruction to

00:36:26.606 --> 00:36:27.736 A:middle
our navigation session.

00:36:27.876 --> 00:36:29.306 A:middle
And now, we're ready to drive.

00:36:29.576 --> 00:36:30.606 A:middle
Let's see it in action.

00:36:38.526 --> 00:36:38.986 A:middle
All right.

00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:40.546 A:middle
Let's browse to our Favorites

00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:42.826 A:middle
list and choose Parks.

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:45.726 A:middle
When we tap one of these

00:36:45.726 --> 00:36:47.676 A:middle
locations we'll see our app pops

00:36:47.676 --> 00:36:49.346 A:middle
back to the map template and

00:36:49.346 --> 00:36:50.786 A:middle
presents a route guidance card.

00:36:51.616 --> 00:36:53.316 A:middle
If we choose to start guidance

00:36:53.316 --> 00:36:54.536 A:middle
by tapping on the Go button

00:36:54.536 --> 00:36:56.376 A:middle
here, we'll see the app enter

00:36:56.376 --> 00:36:57.296 A:middle
navigation mode.

00:36:58.076 --> 00:36:59.886 A:middle
Your app can also update the Nav

00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:01.826 A:middle
bar if needed to show custom
