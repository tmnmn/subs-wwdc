button and my app can zoom in or

00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:03.026 A:middle
out or take any other

00:27:03.026 --> 00:27:04.586 A:middle
appropriate action in response.

00:27:05.756 --> 00:27:07.146 A:middle
That new Favorites button that

00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:08.656 A:middle
Mike just added shows up in the

00:27:08.656 --> 00:27:10.376 A:middle
navigation bar on the trailing

00:27:10.376 --> 00:27:10.726 A:middle
side.

00:27:11.476 --> 00:27:13.266 A:middle
When we tap it our app has

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:15.496 A:middle
created, configured, and pushed

00:27:15.496 --> 00:27:17.316 A:middle
a grid template that lets us

00:27:17.316 --> 00:27:18.466 A:middle
navigate to certain very

00:27:18.466 --> 00:27:19.736 A:middle
important destinations.

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:22.976 A:middle
If we select Parks our app

00:27:22.976 --> 00:27:24.826 A:middle
creates, configures, and pushes

00:27:24.826 --> 00:27:26.706 A:middle
a list template where we can

00:27:26.706 --> 00:27:27.966 A:middle
visualize search results for

00:27:27.966 --> 00:27:29.336 A:middle
interesting nearby parks.

00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:31.076 A:middle
We'll revisit Country Roads,

00:27:31.076 --> 00:27:31.536 A:middle
shortly.

00:27:31.836 --> 00:27:32.976 A:middle
But for now, back to Mike.

00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:39.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:41.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:41.716 A:middle
Thanks, Jonathan.

00:27:43.576 --> 00:27:44.886 A:middle
So, let's talk about one of the

00:27:44.886 --> 00:27:46.106 A:middle
most important functions that

00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:47.646 A:middle
your apps will provide to your

00:27:47.646 --> 00:27:48.586 A:middle
users while driving.

00:27:48.966 --> 00:27:50.236 A:middle
And that, of course, is

00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:51.346 A:middle
turn-by-turn guidance.

00:27:52.116 --> 00:27:53.516 A:middle
Let's start by walking through a

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:56.016 A:middle
typical flow your users may see

00:27:56.436 --> 00:27:57.766 A:middle
while beginning a navigation

00:27:57.766 --> 00:27:58.166 A:middle
session.

00:27:58.926 --> 00:28:01.016 A:middle
The first thing they need is a
