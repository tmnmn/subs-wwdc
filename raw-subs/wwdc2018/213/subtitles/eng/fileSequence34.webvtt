00:33:58.866 --> 00:34:00.356 A:middle
provide banner notifications

00:34:00.446 --> 00:34:02.276 A:middle
that will display when the user

00:34:02.276 --> 00:34:03.166 A:middle
is away from your app.

00:34:03.986 --> 00:34:06.036 A:middle
And this will work for maneuver

00:34:06.036 --> 00:34:07.966 A:middle
updates, as well as navigation

00:34:07.966 --> 00:34:08.426 A:middle
alerts.

00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:11.156 A:middle
On your map template delegate

00:34:11.156 --> 00:34:12.706 A:middle
there are three methods you'll

00:34:12.706 --> 00:34:13.366 A:middle
want to implement.

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.386 A:middle
The first is mapTemplate,

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.585 A:middle
ShouldShowNotificationFor

00:34:16.585 --> 00:34:16.996 A:middle
maneuver.

00:34:17.565 --> 00:34:19.696 A:middle
When you set a new maneuver and

00:34:19.696 --> 00:34:21.565 A:middle
your app is backgrounded this

00:34:21.565 --> 00:34:22.456 A:middle
method will be called.

00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.295 A:middle
And if you return true, the

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:26.266 A:middle
system will take that maneuver

00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:27.576 A:middle
and translate it into a banner

00:34:27.576 --> 00:34:28.176 A:middle
notification.

00:34:29.366 --> 00:34:30.636 A:middle
If you're already presenting a

00:34:30.636 --> 00:34:31.666 A:middle
banner notification for a

00:34:31.666 --> 00:34:32.585 A:middle
maneuver, and simply are

00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:33.835 A:middle
updating the travel estimates,

00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:34.985 A:middle
mapTemplate

00:34:34.985 --> 00:34:36.556 A:middle
shouldUpdateNotificationFor

00:34:36.556 --> 00:34:38.106 A:middle
maneuver with travelEstimates

00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:38.636 A:middle
will be called.

00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:40.025 A:middle
Allowing you to update the

00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:41.206 A:middle
content that appears in that

00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:41.576 A:middle
banner.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:43.085 A:middle
So, instead of rolling a new

00:34:43.085 --> 00:34:45.016 A:middle
notification, you can simply

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:46.206 A:middle
update the contents that are

00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:46.746 A:middle
already there.

00:34:47.545 --> 00:34:49.946 A:middle
And for navigation alerts, you

00:34:49.946 --> 00:34:51.025 A:middle
will have an opportunity to

00:34:51.025 --> 00:34:52.485 A:middle
display those, as well, using

00:34:52.485 --> 00:34:53.156 A:middle
mapTemplate

00:34:53.156 --> 00:34:54.696 A:middle
shouldShowNotificationFor

00:34:54.696 --> 00:34:55.505 A:middle
navigationAlert.

00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:57.846 A:middle
With that, I'd like to invite

00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:59.086 A:middle
Jonathan up one more time to

00:34:59.086 --> 00:35:00.566 A:middle
give you a demo of how we've
