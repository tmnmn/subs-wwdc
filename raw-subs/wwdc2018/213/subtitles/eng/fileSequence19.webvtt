00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:00.216 A:middle
CPBarButton and are created

00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:02.526 A:middle
either with text or images and

00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:04.046 A:middle
are automatically sized and

00:19:04.046 --> 00:19:05.296 A:middle
styled by the system.

00:19:06.086 --> 00:19:08.186 A:middle
There's no notion of predefined

00:19:08.186 --> 00:19:09.536 A:middle
button actions in the CarPlay

00:19:09.536 --> 00:19:10.006 A:middle
framework.

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:11.696 A:middle
But when you create a button,

00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:13.046 A:middle
you provide a custom action

00:19:13.046 --> 00:19:13.506 A:middle
handler.

00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:15.176 A:middle
And when the user interacts with

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:16.716 A:middle
your button on the car screen

00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:18.566 A:middle
your custom action handler will

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:20.386 A:middle
be called in your app.

00:19:20.806 --> 00:19:22.166 A:middle
You may also place up to four

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:23.936 A:middle
buttons that appear above your

00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:24.626 A:middle
map window.

00:19:25.126 --> 00:19:26.476 A:middle
And these are map buttons.

00:19:26.856 --> 00:19:27.786 A:middle
You can create them with an

00:19:27.786 --> 00:19:29.526 A:middle
image, and unlike the bar

00:19:29.526 --> 00:19:31.366 A:middle
buttons, these are not styled by

00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:31.756 A:middle
the system.

00:19:32.656 --> 00:19:34.646 A:middle
The map template is also home to

00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:36.546 A:middle
a lot of other mapping and

00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:37.416 A:middle
navigational related

00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:38.056 A:middle
functionality.

00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:40.096 A:middle
Such as panning the map,

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:42.666 A:middle
providing important contextual

00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:44.096 A:middle
information to your users using

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:45.226 A:middle
navigation alerts.

00:19:45.716 --> 00:19:47.296 A:middle
And of course, turn by turn

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
guidance.

00:19:48.736 --> 00:19:49.426 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:50.416 A:middle
guidance in a little bit.

00:19:50.826 --> 00:19:51.826 A:middle
So, let's get started by going

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:53.796 A:middle
over panning and navigation

00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:54.246 A:middle
alerts.

00:19:54.936 --> 00:19:56.596 A:middle
If your app supports panning the

00:19:56.596 --> 00:19:58.866 A:middle
map, we require that you present

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.386 A:middle
a button on the map template,
