00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:01.826 A:middle
bar if needed to show custom

00:37:01.826 --> 00:37:03.136 A:middle
buttons for navigation mode,

00:37:03.326 --> 00:37:05.056 A:middle
like a Cancel button or a toggle

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:05.896 A:middle
for voice prompts.

00:37:06.396 --> 00:37:07.326 A:middle
Looks like we're making pretty

00:37:07.326 --> 00:37:07.906 A:middle
good time, here.

00:37:09.156 --> 00:37:10.096 A:middle
When we arrive at our

00:37:10.096 --> 00:37:11.876 A:middle
destination our app transitions

00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:13.886 A:middle
back out of navigation mode.

00:37:14.956 --> 00:37:16.846 A:middle
That's it for maps with the

00:37:16.846 --> 00:37:17.686 A:middle
CarPlay framework.

00:37:18.316 --> 00:37:19.716 A:middle
Let's review the roads that

00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:21.176 A:middle
we've driven together today.

00:37:22.236 --> 00:37:24.056 A:middle
We've shown you some big CarPlay

00:37:24.056 --> 00:37:25.586 A:middle
audio performance improvements

00:37:25.616 --> 00:37:27.206 A:middle
and optimizations for a better

00:37:27.206 --> 00:37:28.576 A:middle
experience for your users.

00:37:29.266 --> 00:37:31.156 A:middle
We introduced the brand new

00:37:31.156 --> 00:37:33.326 A:middle
CarPlay framework for navigation

00:37:33.326 --> 00:37:34.816 A:middle
and guidance apps in CarPlay.

00:37:35.526 --> 00:37:37.406 A:middle
Your app can work seamlessly on

00:37:37.406 --> 00:37:38.646 A:middle
different strings and input

00:37:38.646 --> 00:37:39.266 A:middle
devices.

00:37:39.516 --> 00:37:41.056 A:middle
You're the navigation experts

00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:42.426 A:middle
and you only have to do what you

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:44.686 A:middle
do best; draw beautiful maps in

00:37:44.686 --> 00:37:45.756 A:middle
your beautiful apps.

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:47.546 A:middle
And we'll take care of the rest.

00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:49.836 A:middle
You can draw your map template,

00:37:50.066 --> 00:37:51.576 A:middle
use CPMapTemplate and

00:37:51.576 --> 00:37:53.366 A:middle
CPNavigationSession to manage

00:37:53.366 --> 00:37:54.076 A:middle
navigation.

00:37:54.366 --> 00:37:55.746 A:middle
And show other templates as

00:37:55.746 --> 00:37:57.506 A:middle
needed to present information

00:37:57.636 --> 00:37:59.036 A:middle
and handle user interactions.
