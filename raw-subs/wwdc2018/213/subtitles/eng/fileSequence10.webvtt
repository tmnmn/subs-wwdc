00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.606 A:middle
communication to your app to

00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:02.046 A:middle
anticipate whatever the user may

00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:03.736 A:middle
want to play or to browse on the

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:04.506 A:middle
CarPlay display.

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:06.876 A:middle
Now, there's lots of room to

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:08.076 A:middle
improve on your audio app.

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:09.226 A:middle
And let's see how we can do

00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:09.566 A:middle
this.

00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:11.006 A:middle
The first of which, is that we

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:12.306 A:middle
looked into the implementation

00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:13.206 A:middle
of reloadData.

00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:14.186 A:middle
Which, is a call in

00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:15.656 A:middle
MPPlayableContent, and figured

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:17.246 A:middle
out how to better optimize this

00:10:17.246 --> 00:10:18.286 A:middle
for your audio app.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.276 A:middle
What we found is that you should

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:22.876 A:middle
really only call reloadData when

00:10:22.916 --> 00:10:23.956 A:middle
absolutely needed.

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:26.236 A:middle
What it does is that it

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:27.976 A:middle
deconstructs the entire apps'

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:29.556 A:middle
hierarchy on the CarPlay display

00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:31.306 A:middle
and asks your audio app to

00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:32.636 A:middle
reconstruct everything again.

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.056 A:middle
And this can be a very expensive

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:35.706 A:middle
operation, leaving your app not

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:36.486 A:middle
very responsive.

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:38.996 A:middle
Instead, if you just have

00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:40.216 A:middle
content that just needs to be

00:10:40.216 --> 00:10:41.436 A:middle
updated, you should wrap them

00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:42.366 A:middle
together inside of a

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.216 A:middle
beginUpdates and an endUpdates

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:45.866 A:middle
call, so then that content can

00:10:45.866 --> 00:10:47.006 A:middle
be updated, appropriately.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.596 A:middle
Now, these calls that

00:10:50.596 --> 00:10:52.036 A:middle
MPPlayableContent has are

00:10:52.096 --> 00:10:53.636 A:middle
asynchronous operations when we

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:55.006 A:middle
ask you app for your data.

00:10:55.436 --> 00:10:56.976 A:middle
So, keep an internal

00:10:56.976 --> 00:10:58.746 A:middle
representation or a cache of

00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:00.876 A:middle
your information on somewhere in
