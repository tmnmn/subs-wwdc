00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.496 A:middle
When connected to CarPlay, a

00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:01.826 A:middle
navigation app will be given a

00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:03.276 A:middle
window to draw content on the

00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:03.846 A:middle
car screen.

00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:06.576 A:middle
This window is your canvas for

00:17:06.576 --> 00:17:08.156 A:middle
displaying all that beautiful

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:09.955 A:middle
noninteractive mapping and

00:17:09.955 --> 00:17:11.316 A:middle
navigation related content.

00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:14.086 A:middle
Then, as the app used templates

00:17:14.396 --> 00:17:16.136 A:middle
iOS will take those templates

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.626 A:middle
and translate it into a UI

00:17:17.626 --> 00:17:19.606 A:middle
presented on top of your app.

00:17:20.326 --> 00:17:21.116 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:17:21.116 --> 00:17:23.296 A:middle
code on what happens when your

00:17:23.296 --> 00:17:24.316 A:middle
app is connected to CarPlay.

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:26.496 A:middle
The first thing you'll need to

00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:28.195 A:middle
note is that your application

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.086 A:middle
delegate will need to conform to

00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:31.756 A:middle
the CarPlay application delegate

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:33.466 A:middle
protocol, CP Application

00:17:33.466 --> 00:17:33.846 A:middle
Delegate.

00:17:35.106 --> 00:17:36.736 A:middle
One function in that protocol is

00:17:36.736 --> 00:17:38.496 A:middle
application didConnectCar

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:40.106 A:middle
InterfaceController to window.

00:17:41.136 --> 00:17:42.426 A:middle
This function will provide two

00:17:42.426 --> 00:17:43.806 A:middle
very important objects to your

00:17:43.806 --> 00:17:44.216 A:middle
apps.

00:17:44.756 --> 00:17:46.396 A:middle
The first is an instance of

00:17:46.496 --> 00:17:47.846 A:middle
CPInterfaceController.

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:50.416 A:middle
CPInterfaceController is your

00:17:50.416 --> 00:17:51.876 A:middle
connection to the template world

00:17:52.186 --> 00:17:53.276 A:middle
and what your apps will use to

00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:54.656 A:middle
manage what is displaying on the

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:55.176 A:middle
car screen.

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:57.096 A:middle
Additionally, you're given the

00:17:57.096 --> 00:17:58.426 A:middle
window I just mentioned, which

00:17:58.426 --> 00:17:59.686 A:middle
is where you can draw all your

00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:00.486 A:middle
mapping content.
