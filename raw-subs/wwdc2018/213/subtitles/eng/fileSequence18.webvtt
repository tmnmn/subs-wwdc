00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:00.486 A:middle
mapping content.

00:18:01.376 --> 00:18:02.836 A:middle
You want to be sure to keep a

00:18:02.836 --> 00:18:03.776 A:middle
reference to both of these

00:18:03.776 --> 00:18:05.106 A:middle
objects throughout the duration

00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:05.986 A:middle
of the CarPlay session.

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:08.786 A:middle
Next, you can create a new view

00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:10.236 A:middle
controller to populate that

00:18:10.236 --> 00:18:11.746 A:middle
window with content and assign

00:18:11.746 --> 00:18:12.906 A:middle
it to windows review controller.

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:14.736 A:middle
And then, create a root

00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:15.166 A:middle
template.

00:18:15.416 --> 00:18:16.456 A:middle
And using that interface

00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:17.406 A:middle
controller object, you can

00:18:17.406 --> 00:18:18.696 A:middle
setRootTemplate on the car

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:19.036 A:middle
screen.

00:18:19.806 --> 00:18:21.376 A:middle
So, let's talk about some of

00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:22.136 A:middle
these templates that are

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.336 A:middle
available in the CarPlay

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:23.826 A:middle
framework.

00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:26.156 A:middle
And we'll start with one you've

00:18:26.156 --> 00:18:27.816 A:middle
already seen and where your

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:29.276 A:middle
users will spend a majority of

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:29.856 A:middle
their time.

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:31.956 A:middle
And that is on the map template.

00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:34.476 A:middle
The map template is unique from

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:35.626 A:middle
all the other templates in that

00:18:35.626 --> 00:18:37.426 A:middle
it is transparent to your app

00:18:37.476 --> 00:18:37.916 A:middle
window.

00:18:38.566 --> 00:18:40.356 A:middle
So, the content that you draw on

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:42.136 A:middle
that window will be displayed

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.526 A:middle
underneath the content provided

00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:44.396 A:middle
by the map template.

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:46.256 A:middle
The map template can be

00:18:46.256 --> 00:18:47.676 A:middle
configured in a few different

00:18:47.676 --> 00:18:48.176 A:middle
places.

00:18:48.616 --> 00:18:49.646 A:middle
You can place buttons in the

00:18:49.646 --> 00:18:50.446 A:middle
navigation bar.

00:18:51.076 --> 00:18:52.946 A:middle
You can place up to four; two on

00:18:52.946 --> 00:18:54.966 A:middle
the leading side and two on the

00:18:54.966 --> 00:18:55.606 A:middle
trailing side.

00:18:56.246 --> 00:18:57.836 A:middle
These are instances of

00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:00.216 A:middle
CPBarButton and are created
