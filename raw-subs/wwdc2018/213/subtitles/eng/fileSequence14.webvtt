00:13:58.826 --> 00:14:00.246 A:middle
logged out and will need to log

00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:00.496 A:middle
in.

00:14:01.526 --> 00:14:02.356 A:middle
But how does this look on

00:14:02.356 --> 00:14:02.836 A:middle
CarPlay?

00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:05.376 A:middle
Well, Srirocka, actually,

00:14:05.376 --> 00:14:06.716 A:middle
doesn't provide data when logged

00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:07.066 A:middle
out.

00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:08.986 A:middle
And this leads to a very poor

00:14:08.986 --> 00:14:10.026 A:middle
user experience.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.286 A:middle
The user doesn't really know

00:14:11.286 --> 00:14:13.226 A:middle
what's going on here and isn't

00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:15.716 A:middle
able to interact with your app.

00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:17.726 A:middle
You should make sure that you

00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:19.036 A:middle
should provide some type of

00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:20.966 A:middle
experience, so that the user can

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.346 A:middle
at least interact with your app,

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:23.826 A:middle
even if your app is logged out.

00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:25.456 A:middle
So, this leads to a very good

00:14:25.456 --> 00:14:26.936 A:middle
user experience for your audio

00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:28.286 A:middle
app.

00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:30.366 A:middle
So, wrapping all this up, we can

00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:31.696 A:middle
say that CarPlay audio apps have

00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:32.596 A:middle
its greatest hits.

00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:35.766 A:middle
MPPlayableContent allows your

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:37.086 A:middle
app to provide templates to the

00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:38.686 A:middle
CarPlay display so that your app

00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:40.586 A:middle
can provide users a good user

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:41.516 A:middle
experience to the CarPlay

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:41.946 A:middle
display.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:43.916 A:middle
You should account for real

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:45.096 A:middle
world scenarios, such as when

00:14:45.096 --> 00:14:46.556 A:middle
your app is logged out or your

00:14:46.556 --> 00:14:48.326 A:middle
screen is locked, so then that

00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:49.506 A:middle
your app can still function

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:50.476 A:middle
beautifully in CarPlay.

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:53.626 A:middle
And with iOS 12, we made some

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:54.836 A:middle
great optimizations and

00:14:54.836 --> 00:14:56.366 A:middle
performance improvements to make

00:14:56.366 --> 00:14:57.826 A:middle
your app even better in CarPlay.

00:14:58.146 --> 00:14:59.126 A:middle
So, you should run your app

00:14:59.126 --> 00:15:00.516 A:middle
again and see if there's any
