00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
CPManeuver you will set upcoming

00:32:01.896 --> 00:32:03.726 A:middle
maneuvers and the system will

00:32:03.726 --> 00:32:05.076 A:middle
automatically display a primary

00:32:05.076 --> 00:32:05.526 A:middle
maneuver.

00:32:05.866 --> 00:32:07.306 A:middle
And if you provide a second

00:32:07.306 --> 00:32:08.476 A:middle
maneuver it can display a

00:32:08.476 --> 00:32:09.596 A:middle
secondary maneuver on that

00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:10.126 A:middle
guidance card.

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:12.856 A:middle
You will then use update

00:32:12.856 --> 00:32:14.276 A:middle
estimates for maneuver to

00:32:14.276 --> 00:32:15.926 A:middle
continually update what is being

00:32:16.156 --> 00:32:17.436 A:middle
shown in that guidance card.

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:19.286 A:middle
And let your users know when

00:32:19.386 --> 00:32:20.446 A:middle
their maneuver is approaching.

00:32:21.276 --> 00:32:22.786 A:middle
And most likely, your app will

00:32:22.786 --> 00:32:24.306 A:middle
be playing back audio prompts to

00:32:24.306 --> 00:32:25.186 A:middle
let them know, as well.

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.246 A:middle
For this, you'll want to make

00:32:27.246 --> 00:32:28.496 A:middle
sure that your audio session is

00:32:28.496 --> 00:32:29.856 A:middle
configured appropriately for

00:32:29.856 --> 00:32:30.326 A:middle
CarPlay.

00:32:31.156 --> 00:32:32.966 A:middle
We have to remember that when in

00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:34.676 A:middle
the car your users may be

00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:35.686 A:middle
listening to an audio source

00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:37.596 A:middle
from iOS or they may be

00:32:37.596 --> 00:32:38.606 A:middle
listening to an audio source

00:32:38.606 --> 00:32:40.156 A:middle
from the car, such as FM radio.

00:32:41.036 --> 00:32:42.246 A:middle
You want to configure your audio

00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:43.066 A:middle
session with

00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:45.436 A:middle
AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt as

00:32:45.436 --> 00:32:47.366 A:middle
this will let the CarPlay system

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:49.326 A:middle
know when to appropriately duck

00:32:49.376 --> 00:32:50.766 A:middle
the audio source, regardless of

00:32:50.766 --> 00:32:51.446 A:middle
where it's coming from.

00:32:51.776 --> 00:32:52.676 A:middle
You can, also, configure your

00:32:52.676 --> 00:32:54.496 A:middle
session with the category

00:32:54.496 --> 00:32:56.186 A:middle
options duckOthers and

00:32:56.186 --> 00:32:57.436 A:middle
interruptSpokenAudio

00:32:57.436 --> 00:32:58.126 A:middle
AndMixWithOthers.

00:32:58.186 --> 00:32:59.216 A:middle
And this will help ensure that

00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:01.136 A:middle
your audio plays well with other
