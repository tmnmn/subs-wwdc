00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:00.996 A:middle
Now, if you already set Now

00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:02.446 A:middle
Playing metadata to Control

00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:03.976 A:middle
Center or Lock Screen, or you're

00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:05.196 A:middle
already working on this on your

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:06.696 A:middle
existing audio app, you're

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:08.016 A:middle
already familiar with these two

00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:08.576 A:middle
APIs.

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:12.706 A:middle
MPNowPlayingInfo Center allows

00:08:12.706 --> 00:08:14.006 A:middle
you to populate your now playing

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:16.016 A:middle
metadata and things such as

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:17.586 A:middle
title and album artwork and

00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:19.556 A:middle
etcetera onto the CarPlay's now

00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:20.276 A:middle
playing screen.

00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:21.676 A:middle
As well as Control Center and

00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:22.566 A:middle
Lock Screen if you've already

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:23.176 A:middle
been doing so.

00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:26.006 A:middle
MPRemoteCommandCenter allows

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.436 A:middle
your app to respond to remote

00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:29.246 A:middle
command events, such as the Play

00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:31.046 A:middle
command, Next Track, and so on.

00:08:32.116 --> 00:08:33.346 A:middle
We want to allow your CarPlay

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.966 A:middle
app for a seamless Now Playing

00:08:34.966 --> 00:08:35.655 A:middle
experience.

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:36.716 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at how

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.885 A:middle
this is done in code.

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:40.566 A:middle
So, when Srirocka is launched,

00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:41.506 A:middle
I'm going to use Srirocka as an

00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:42.166 A:middle
example, here.

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:43.606 A:middle
This is what is needed at a

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.226 A:middle
minimum to support CarPlay audio

00:08:45.226 --> 00:08:45.526 A:middle
apps.

00:08:46.036 --> 00:08:47.436 A:middle
Srirocka will provide a data

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:49.366 A:middle
source and a delegate to

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.086 A:middle
MPPlayableContentManager, so

00:08:51.086 --> 00:08:52.306 A:middle
that Srirocka can provide

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:53.446 A:middle
information to the CarPlay

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:55.076 A:middle
display and respond when

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:55.986 A:middle
absolutely necessary.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.506 A:middle
Next, I've set

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.916 A:middle
NowPlayingInfoCenter to let
