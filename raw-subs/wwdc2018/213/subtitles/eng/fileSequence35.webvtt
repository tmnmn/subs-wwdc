00:34:59.086 --> 00:35:00.566 A:middle
give you a demo of how we've

00:35:00.566 --> 00:35:01.886 A:middle
integrated our Country Roads app

00:35:01.886 --> 00:35:03.296 A:middle
with the CarPlay framework to do

00:35:03.296 --> 00:35:04.726 A:middle
route preview and turn-by-turn

00:35:04.726 --> 00:35:05.216 A:middle
guidance.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:13.586 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at some

00:35:13.586 --> 00:35:15.326 A:middle
code for how your navigation

00:35:15.326 --> 00:35:16.676 A:middle
apps can provide guidance in

00:35:16.676 --> 00:35:18.596 A:middle
CarPlay using our sample Country

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:19.116 A:middle
Roads app.

00:35:20.306 --> 00:35:21.766 A:middle
When the user selects a

00:35:21.766 --> 00:35:23.436 A:middle
destination, we're going to grab

00:35:23.436 --> 00:35:25.116 A:middle
that placemark and hand the

00:35:25.116 --> 00:35:27.156 A:middle
current location and destination

00:35:27.356 --> 00:35:28.826 A:middle
to our navigation engine to

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.246 A:middle
calculate some route choices.

00:35:30.616 --> 00:35:32.546 A:middle
For our purposes here, we have

00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:34.256 A:middle
only a single route choice, but

00:35:34.256 --> 00:35:35.726 A:middle
your navigation engine can

00:35:35.726 --> 00:35:37.566 A:middle
provide multiple alternative

00:35:37.566 --> 00:35:38.986 A:middle
routing options when available.

00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:40.696 A:middle
Plus, we can include some extra

00:35:40.696 --> 00:35:42.476 A:middle
details to help the user make an

00:35:42.476 --> 00:35:44.706 A:middle
informed decision about a route.

00:35:44.786 --> 00:35:46.886 A:middle
We'll create a CPTrip and call

00:35:46.886 --> 00:35:49.116 A:middle
showTripPreviews to inform

00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:50.146 A:middle
CarPlay that we're starting

00:35:50.146 --> 00:35:51.256 A:middle
navigation guidance.

00:35:51.886 --> 00:35:53.376 A:middle
Lastly, we'll update the

00:35:53.376 --> 00:35:55.326 A:middle
estimates to provide our user an

00:35:55.326 --> 00:35:56.496 A:middle
ETA for this trip.

00:35:57.036 --> 00:35:58.166 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at how

00:35:58.166 --> 00:35:59.416 A:middle
we can provide the maneuvers

00:35:59.416 --> 00:36:00.356 A:middle
that CarPlay needs for
