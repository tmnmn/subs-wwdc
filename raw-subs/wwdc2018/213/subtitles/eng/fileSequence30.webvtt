00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:01.886 A:middle
As the user toggles through

00:30:01.886 --> 00:30:03.576 A:middle
individual routes you have an

00:30:03.576 --> 00:30:04.736 A:middle
opportunity to update the

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.066 A:middle
content that is being displayed

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:06.746 A:middle
in your window.

00:30:07.636 --> 00:30:09.396 A:middle
MapTemplate selectedPreviewFor

00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:11.056 A:middle
trip using routeChoice will be

00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:12.236 A:middle
called and you can change what

00:30:12.236 --> 00:30:12.916 A:middle
is being displayed.

00:30:13.776 --> 00:30:15.406 A:middle
This is a great opportunity to

00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:17.366 A:middle
mention how the map template is

00:30:17.396 --> 00:30:19.606 A:middle
drawing content that covers up

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:20.286 A:middle
your window.

00:30:21.366 --> 00:30:22.276 A:middle
And you'll want to make sure

00:30:22.276 --> 00:30:23.556 A:middle
that the content you're drawing

00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:25.166 A:middle
is visible to your users.

00:30:26.096 --> 00:30:27.516 A:middle
For this, we've leveraged the

00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:29.436 A:middle
existing safeArea API you may

00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:30.466 A:middle
already be familiar with.

00:30:31.336 --> 00:30:33.226 A:middle
As the content changes from the

00:30:33.226 --> 00:30:35.146 A:middle
map template it will update the

00:30:35.146 --> 00:30:37.446 A:middle
safeArea insets on your window

00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:38.626 A:middle
to let you know where it is safe

00:30:38.626 --> 00:30:39.016 A:middle
to draw.

00:30:39.226 --> 00:30:40.496 A:middle
You'll just want to implement

00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:42.666 A:middle
safeAreaInsetsDidChange and pay

00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:44.036 A:middle
close attention to those insets

00:30:44.036 --> 00:30:45.456 A:middle
and make sure your content is

00:30:45.456 --> 00:30:47.546 A:middle
drawn within them.

00:30:47.756 --> 00:30:48.696 A:middle
Now, let's talk about turn by

00:30:48.696 --> 00:30:49.406 A:middle
turn guidance.

00:30:50.486 --> 00:30:52.226 A:middle
Similar to our preview, your app

00:30:52.256 --> 00:30:54.156 A:middle
can provide data to the CarPlay

00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:55.656 A:middle
framework that will cause it to

00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:58.256 A:middle
draw a guidance card populated

00:30:58.256 --> 00:30:59.366 A:middle
with information, such as an

00:30:59.396 --> 00:31:00.716 A:middle
image representing the maneuver.
