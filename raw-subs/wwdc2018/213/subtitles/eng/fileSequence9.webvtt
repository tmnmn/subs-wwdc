00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.916 A:middle
NowPlayingInfoCenter to let

00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:02.756 A:middle
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter know that

00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:03.886 A:middle
my app will be providing

00:09:03.886 --> 00:09:05.386 A:middle
NowPlaying metadata when it

00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:06.386 A:middle
becomes a Now Playing app.

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:09.506 A:middle
And finally, I've responded to

00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:10.916 A:middle
MPRemoteCommandCenter events.

00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:12.046 A:middle
Specifically, just a Play

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.716 A:middle
command in this case, so that

00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:15.576 A:middle
when Srirocka becomes the Now

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:16.856 A:middle
Playing app it can respond to

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:17.476 A:middle
these events.

00:09:18.656 --> 00:09:21.216 A:middle
So, we can see here that the one

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:23.256 A:middle
API that was needed for CarPlay

00:09:23.256 --> 00:09:24.426 A:middle
is MPPlayableContent.

00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:27.006 A:middle
And for iOS 12, we took a good

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:28.316 A:middle
look at how to better optimize

00:09:28.316 --> 00:09:30.116 A:middle
this and we can safely say, for

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:32.006 A:middle
iOS 12, we've remastered

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:32.826 A:middle
MPPlayableContent.

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:38.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:40.836 A:middle
We took a deep dive into

00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:42.566 A:middle
MPPlayableContent and we pushed

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:43.866 A:middle
for performance improvements in

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:45.396 A:middle
how the data source and delegate

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:46.206 A:middle
calls are made.

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.516 A:middle
Without changing your current

00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:49.726 A:middle
audio app's implementation in

00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:51.686 A:middle
CarPlay, we sped up the startup

00:09:51.686 --> 00:09:53.006 A:middle
sequence and provided much

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:54.336 A:middle
smoother animations whenever

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:55.546 A:middle
content is changed on the

00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:56.246 A:middle
CarPlay display.

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:58.746 A:middle
We've also provided much better

00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.606 A:middle
communication to your app to
