00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:00.546 A:middle
indexPath to initiate fetching

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:01.046 A:middle
content.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.006 A:middle
This API will be called whenever

00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:05.316 A:middle
any of your index paths are

00:13:05.316 --> 00:13:06.856 A:middle
visible on the CarPlay display.

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.406 A:middle
So, when the user is scrolling

00:13:08.406 --> 00:13:10.106 A:middle
through table cells or selecting

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:10.906 A:middle
different tabs,

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:12.946 A:middle
beginLoadingChildItems will be

00:13:12.946 --> 00:13:14.366 A:middle
called for every single index

00:13:14.366 --> 00:13:15.666 A:middle
path that shows on the display.

00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:18.626 A:middle
This gives your app a chance to

00:13:18.626 --> 00:13:20.136 A:middle
start loading before the user,

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:21.536 A:middle
actually, selects the content.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:23.896 A:middle
And here's a code example inside

00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:26.036 A:middle
of Srirocka, where when the user

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:28.116 A:middle
sees that the Heating Habaneros

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:29.396 A:middle
playlist is visible on the

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:31.086 A:middle
CarPlay display, we start

00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:32.726 A:middle
processing that playlist.

00:13:32.726 --> 00:13:33.876 A:middle
And when the user makes a

00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:35.426 A:middle
selection, will have either been

00:13:35.426 --> 00:13:36.496 A:middle
midway through the network

00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:39.036 A:middle
request or ready to go and able

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:39.946 A:middle
to provide content.

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:42.906 A:middle
So, let's take a look at some

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:45.446 A:middle
app scenarios that may occur

00:13:45.766 --> 00:13:47.106 A:middle
when developing your app for

00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:47.516 A:middle
CarPlay.

00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:50.226 A:middle
Now, Srirocka provides a very

00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:52.926 A:middle
rich user experience when logged

00:13:52.926 --> 00:13:53.176 A:middle
out.

00:13:53.426 --> 00:13:54.646 A:middle
It's very clear here, with

00:13:54.816 --> 00:13:56.436 A:middle
beautiful typography and great

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:58.826 A:middle
graphic design, that the user is

00:13:58.826 --> 00:14:00.246 A:middle
logged out and will need to log
