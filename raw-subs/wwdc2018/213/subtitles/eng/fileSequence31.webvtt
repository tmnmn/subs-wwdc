00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:02.676 A:middle
How much farther it is until you

00:31:02.676 --> 00:31:03.136 A:middle
arrive there.

00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:05.936 A:middle
And of course, instructions on

00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:06.806 A:middle
what to do when you get there,

00:31:06.806 --> 00:31:08.366 A:middle
such as turn left or continue

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:08.706 A:middle
straight.

00:31:09.186 --> 00:31:12.616 A:middle
Let's take a look at what you'll

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:15.026 A:middle
need to learn to use turn by

00:31:15.026 --> 00:31:16.046 A:middle
turn guidance in the CarPlay

00:31:16.046 --> 00:31:16.416 A:middle
framework.

00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:20.826 A:middle
The CPMapTemplateDelegate and

00:31:20.826 --> 00:31:22.436 A:middle
the mapTemplate are two places

00:31:22.436 --> 00:31:23.126 A:middle
you'll need to start.

00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:24.716 A:middle
First, when the user hits that

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:25.926 A:middle
go button from Route Preview

00:31:26.686 --> 00:31:28.426 A:middle
mapTemplate startedTrip using

00:31:28.426 --> 00:31:29.656 A:middle
routeChoice will be called on

00:31:29.656 --> 00:31:30.636 A:middle
your template delegate.

00:31:31.226 --> 00:31:33.166 A:middle
This is your indication to begin

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.966 A:middle
navigation to that destination

00:31:34.966 --> 00:31:36.436 A:middle
using the route choice the user

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:36.996 A:middle
has selected.

00:31:37.656 --> 00:31:39.276 A:middle
This is when you would begin

00:31:39.386 --> 00:31:41.276 A:middle
navigation in your app, and

00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:42.686 A:middle
also, begin providing turn by

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:43.796 A:middle
turn updates to the CarPlay

00:31:43.796 --> 00:31:44.186 A:middle
framework.

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:46.066 A:middle
You'll want to call

00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:48.126 A:middle
startNavigationSession for trip

00:31:48.356 --> 00:31:49.226 A:middle
on your map template.

00:31:49.456 --> 00:31:50.536 A:middle
And this will provide you with

00:31:50.536 --> 00:31:51.456 A:middle
an instance of

00:31:51.516 --> 00:31:52.886 A:middle
CPNavigationSession.

00:31:52.886 --> 00:31:54.636 A:middle
And this is where you manage

00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:55.966 A:middle
those upcoming maneuvers.

00:31:56.406 --> 00:31:59.836 A:middle
Using CPNavigationSession and

00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
CPManeuver you will set upcoming
