00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:00.486 A:middle
Let's start with a quick review

00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:02.936 A:middle
of CarPlay.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.696 A:middle
CarPlay is a smarter safer way

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:07.206 A:middle
to use iPhone in the car.

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.266 A:middle
You can seamlessly perform

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.976 A:middle
common scenarios while driving

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:12.486 A:middle
using your car's built-in

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:12.946 A:middle
display.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.666 A:middle
You can make calls, send and

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.446 A:middle
receive messages, listen to

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:20.006 A:middle
audio, podcasts, and radio, and

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:21.956 A:middle
now, get directions with your

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.926 A:middle
navigation apps, all while

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:25.136 A:middle
staying focused on the road.

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:27.666 A:middle
You can think of the car screen

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.896 A:middle
like a second external display

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:31.206 A:middle
for your phone.

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.176 A:middle
Your app can present a version

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.486 A:middle
of itself on the car screen with

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:37.816 A:middle
UI and features optimized for

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:38.666 A:middle
use in the car.

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.306 A:middle
There are some special design

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:43.076 A:middle
considerations for your app when

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:45.846 A:middle
presented in CarPlay.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.056 A:middle
CarPlay vehicles have a wide

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:49.566 A:middle
variety of input styles.

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:51.586 A:middle
Some cars have touchscreens.

00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:53.726 A:middle
Others have a rotary knob that

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:55.296 A:middle
lets you move focus around and

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:56.176 A:middle
select elements.

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:58.156 A:middle
And some have a touchpad that

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.856 A:middle
allows for swipe gestures, and

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:01.346 A:middle
you can even do character entry
