00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:01.376 A:middle
And such incredible and

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:02.276 A:middle
immersive navigation

00:16:02.276 --> 00:16:02.916 A:middle
experiences.

00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:04.646 A:middle
And your users will expect to

00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:06.306 A:middle
see that on the car screen.

00:16:07.206 --> 00:16:09.356 A:middle
So, new in iOS 12, we're

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:10.576 A:middle
introducing the CarPlay

00:16:10.576 --> 00:16:11.096 A:middle
framework.

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:13.436 A:middle
The CarPlay framework is your

00:16:13.436 --> 00:16:15.196 A:middle
toolkit for building great

00:16:15.426 --> 00:16:17.216 A:middle
interactive experiences on the

00:16:17.216 --> 00:16:17.916 A:middle
car screen.

00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:20.246 A:middle
It uses a fixed set of template

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:21.926 A:middle
objects that your apps can build

00:16:21.926 --> 00:16:23.726 A:middle
and use, and that iOS will

00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:25.766 A:middle
translate into a UI presented on

00:16:25.766 --> 00:16:26.556 A:middle
top of your app.

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:28.916 A:middle
With this and a little bit of

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:30.916 A:middle
effort on your part, your apps

00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:32.686 A:middle
will support all CarPlay

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:33.236 A:middle
systems.

00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:35.606 A:middle
So, let's take a look at an app

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:36.156 A:middle
in CarPlay.

00:16:36.906 --> 00:16:37.776 A:middle
We've been building our own

00:16:37.776 --> 00:16:39.226 A:middle
navigation app that we call

00:16:39.226 --> 00:16:40.166 A:middle
Country Roads.

00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:41.636 A:middle
It takes us to our favorite

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:43.276 A:middle
destinations using the scenic

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:43.496 A:middle
route.

00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:45.216 A:middle
And let's see what it looks like

00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:45.816 A:middle
on CarPlay.

00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:48.436 A:middle
We're looking at the CarPlay

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:49.626 A:middle
home screen and you can see our

00:16:49.626 --> 00:16:51.266 A:middle
Country Roads app icon right

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:52.486 A:middle
there with the rest of the apps

00:16:52.486 --> 00:16:53.096 A:middle
on iOS.

00:16:53.976 --> 00:16:55.566 A:middle
As we launch it, the first thing

00:16:55.566 --> 00:16:57.186 A:middle
you'll be greeted with is our

00:16:57.186 --> 00:16:58.356 A:middle
beautiful map tiles.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.496 A:middle
When connected to CarPlay, a
