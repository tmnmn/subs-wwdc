00:14:59.126 --> 00:15:00.516 A:middle
again and see if there's any

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:01.636 A:middle
performance improvements you can

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:02.706 A:middle
make to your app, to make it

00:15:02.706 --> 00:15:03.196 A:middle
even better.

00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:05.626 A:middle
Now, to make us sure that we're

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:06.916 A:middle
steering in the right direction,

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:08.226 A:middle
I'd like to invite my colleague,

00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:09.866 A:middle
Mike, to talk about navigating

00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:10.656 A:middle
with the CarPlay framework.

00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:11.366 A:middle
Thank you.

00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:16.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:17.096 --> 00:15:17.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:18.356 A:middle
Thank you, Albert.

00:15:19.356 --> 00:15:20.796 A:middle
I am thrilled to share with you,

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.246 A:middle
today, how to add CarPlay

00:15:22.246 --> 00:15:24.406 A:middle
support to your navigation apps.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.686 A:middle
Navigation is such a huge part

00:15:27.686 --> 00:15:29.466 A:middle
of the CarPlay experience and

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:31.556 A:middle
your users will be so happy to

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.176 A:middle
see their favorite apps on the

00:15:33.176 --> 00:15:33.726 A:middle
car screen.

00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:36.016 A:middle
As Jonathan and Albert have

00:15:36.016 --> 00:15:37.456 A:middle
previously mentioned, we've

00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:39.056 A:middle
employed a template based

00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:40.206 A:middle
approach for previous app

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:40.896 A:middle
categories.

00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:42.946 A:middle
Your apps have been able to

00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:45.036 A:middle
provide data and metadata that

00:15:45.036 --> 00:15:46.386 A:middle
iOS will display on the car

00:15:46.386 --> 00:15:47.626 A:middle
screen and manage these

00:15:47.626 --> 00:15:48.826 A:middle
interactions on your app's

00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:49.246 A:middle
behalf.

00:15:49.486 --> 00:15:51.456 A:middle
And this has worked extremely

00:15:51.456 --> 00:15:51.836 A:middle
well.

00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:54.416 A:middle
But, we realize that navigation

00:15:54.416 --> 00:15:56.136 A:middle
apps are a little bit different.

00:15:56.816 --> 00:15:59.716 A:middle
Your apps have beautiful maps.
