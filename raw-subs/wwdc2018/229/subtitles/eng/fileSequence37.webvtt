indeed the culprit for whatever

00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:01.546 A:middle
performance problems you may be

00:37:01.546 --> 00:37:01.906 A:middle
seeing.

00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:05.076 A:middle
And now, we've reached the end

00:37:05.076 --> 00:37:06.416 A:middle
of today's dive into the

00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:07.906 A:middle
incredible power of our world's

00:37:07.906 --> 00:37:08.786 A:middle
collections in Swift.

00:37:08.836 --> 00:37:10.946 A:middle
I want you to use this new-found

00:37:10.946 --> 00:37:12.356 A:middle
understanding to review your

00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:13.656 A:middle
existing use of collections.

00:37:14.046 --> 00:37:15.086 A:middle
Look for places where you can

00:37:15.086 --> 00:37:16.316 A:middle
improve your code through more

00:37:16.316 --> 00:37:17.716 A:middle
effective use of indices and

00:37:17.716 --> 00:37:18.196 A:middle
slices.

00:37:18.926 --> 00:37:19.756 A:middle
Measure your code.

00:37:20.656 --> 00:37:21.716 A:middle
And look for places where you

00:37:21.716 --> 00:37:23.586 A:middle
could benefit by being lazy or

00:37:24.196 --> 00:37:25.786 A:middle
by tuning how you bridge.

00:37:26.966 --> 00:37:28.526 A:middle
Use the thread sanitizer to help

00:37:28.556 --> 00:37:30.766 A:middle
audit your mutable state, and

00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:31.866 A:middle
further hone your mastery of

00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:33.066 A:middle
collections by apply all the

00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:34.256 A:middle
concepts discussed today in

00:37:34.306 --> 00:37:36.646 A:middle
Playgrounds and you own apps.

00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:38.986 A:middle
Be sure to visit our last few

00:37:38.986 --> 00:37:39.946 A:middle
labs today if you have any

00:37:39.946 --> 00:37:41.016 A:middle
questions about collections.

00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:41.796 A:middle
We're here to help.

00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:43.666 A:middle

00:37:43.836 --> 00:37:44.856 A:middle
Now go out and be effective.
