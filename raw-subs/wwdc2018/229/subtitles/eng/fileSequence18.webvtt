00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:00.176 A:middle
We already know that they're

00:18:00.176 --> 00:18:00.706 A:middle
bears.

00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:01.796 A:middle
They don't need to tell us

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:02.336 A:middle
again.

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.576 A:middle
So let's write some code to find

00:18:04.576 --> 00:18:05.756 A:middle
those silly, redundant bears,

00:18:05.756 --> 00:18:07.356 A:middle
and we'll do this using a lazy

00:18:07.356 --> 00:18:08.366 A:middle
filter, as before.

00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:11.996 A:middle
And in this case, producing a

00:18:11.996 --> 00:18:13.206 A:middle
lazy filter is going to be a

00:18:13.206 --> 00:18:14.676 A:middle
lazy filter collection that

00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:16.156 A:middle
wraps an array of strings.

00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:17.946 A:middle
In our closer here, were going

00:18:17.946 --> 00:18:19.396 A:middle
to print out which bear we're

00:18:19.396 --> 00:18:21.056 A:middle
currently iterating on before we

00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:21.836 A:middle
do our predicate check.

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.006 A:middle
And we're doing this because I

00:18:23.006 --> 00:18:24.146 A:middle
want to understand how filter

00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:25.096 A:middle
works a little better, and then

00:18:25.096 --> 00:18:26.806 A:middle
we'll call first, and when we do

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.116 A:middle
this, we'll defer to the lazy

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:31.446 A:middle
filter collection, and then the

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:32.726 A:middle
lazy filter collection will in

00:18:32.776 --> 00:18:33.966 A:middle
turn defer to the original

00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:37.226 A:middle
storage where we'll print out

00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:41.476 A:middle
Grizzly, check the predicate,

00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:43.496 A:middle
which in this case is false,

00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:44.406 A:middle
Grizzly does not contain the

00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:45.636 A:middle
word bear, and advance on to

00:18:45.636 --> 00:18:45.976 A:middle
panda.

00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:51.046 A:middle
When we get to panda, when we

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:52.456 A:middle
get to panda, we'll again print

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:54.596 A:middle
out panda, check to see if it

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:55.936 A:middle
contains the word bear, and

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:56.926 A:middle
advance on to spectacle.

00:18:57.996 --> 00:19:00.006 A:middle
Spectacle gets printed, also
