00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:03.146 A:middle
And in this world, we may not

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.816 A:middle
have arrays, but it still has

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:07.796 A:middle
bears, but every time we need

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:10.136 A:middle
another bear, we're going to

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.436 A:middle
need to define another variable,

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:13.296 A:middle
and we want to do things with

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:13.726 A:middle
these bears.

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:14.666 A:middle
We're going to need to repeat

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.266 A:middle
ourselves.

00:01:16.306 --> 00:01:17.106 A:middle
Pretty scary, right?

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:19.236 A:middle
It gets worse though.

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:20.596 A:middle
This world also doesn't have

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:23.196 A:middle
dictionaries, but thankfully

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:25.016 A:middle
being clever developers, we can

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:25.766 A:middle
work around that with the

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.936 A:middle
function, where we painstakingly

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:29.246 A:middle
define each case that we care

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:31.586 A:middle
about, and using this function

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:32.546 A:middle
is very similar to using a

00:01:32.546 --> 00:01:34.716 A:middle
dictionary, except none of those

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:35.926 A:middle
dynamic capabilities that we

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:36.136 A:middle
need.

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.676 A:middle
But who likes a mutable state,

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:37.906 A:middle
right?

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:40.536 A:middle
Fortunately for us though, we

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:41.356 A:middle
don't live in this world.

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:43.816 A:middle
Thankfully our world has bears

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:45.586 A:middle
and collections along with a

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:47.016 A:middle
rich first-class syntax for

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:47.546 A:middle
defining them.

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:51.086 A:middle
And APIs that help us not repeat

00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:53.666 A:middle
ourselves when we iterate or

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:55.316 A:middle
retrieve the elements that they

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:55.886 A:middle
may store.

00:01:57.336 --> 00:01:58.916 A:middle
Collections are so pervasive and

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:00.506 A:middle
share so many common features
