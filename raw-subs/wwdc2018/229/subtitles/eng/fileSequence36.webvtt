00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:00.346 A:middle
but we're still bridging.

00:36:01.406 --> 00:36:03.456 A:middle
Brown here is a Swift value type

00:36:03.456 --> 00:36:03.786 A:middle
string.

00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:07.976 A:middle
And every time we call into the

00:36:07.976 --> 00:36:09.526 A:middle
objective-C API range of

00:36:09.606 --> 00:36:10.376 A:middle
[inaudible] NSString, we're

00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:11.896 A:middle
actually going to bridge that

00:36:11.896 --> 00:36:13.236 A:middle
teeny, tiny string back to an

00:36:13.236 --> 00:36:13.686 A:middle
NSString.

00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:15.886 A:middle
This is inexpensive in this

00:36:15.886 --> 00:36:16.066 A:middle
case.

00:36:16.066 --> 00:36:17.546 A:middle
I'm only doing it once, but you

00:36:17.606 --> 00:36:18.696 A:middle
can imagine, if this was in a

00:36:18.696 --> 00:36:20.206 A:middle
loop, that small amount would

00:36:20.206 --> 00:36:21.006 A:middle
add up over time.

00:36:21.156 --> 00:36:23.246 A:middle
And so you want to take care to

00:36:23.476 --> 00:36:24.486 A:middle
avoid bridging the same small

00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:25.246 A:middle
strings repeatedly.

00:36:25.546 --> 00:36:26.446 A:middle
However, before you do such

00:36:26.446 --> 00:36:28.056 A:middle
optimizations, always measure.

00:36:29.476 --> 00:36:30.516 A:middle
And so now that we've seen the

00:36:30.516 --> 00:36:31.406 A:middle
details of bridging, I want to

00:36:31.406 --> 00:36:32.346 A:middle
offer a little bit of advice

00:36:32.346 --> 00:36:33.616 A:middle
about when to use Foundation

00:36:33.616 --> 00:36:34.196 A:middle
collections.

00:36:34.686 --> 00:36:36.836 A:middle
You should consider using them

00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:38.106 A:middle
explicitly when you need a

00:36:38.106 --> 00:36:39.096 A:middle
collection with reference

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:39.756 A:middle
semantics.

00:36:40.606 --> 00:36:41.496 A:middle
Don't need to write one of those

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:42.596 A:middle
for yourself, we already have

00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:43.326 A:middle
many great ones.

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:44.956 A:middle
You should also use it when

00:36:44.956 --> 00:36:45.796 A:middle
you're working with types that

00:36:45.796 --> 00:36:46.876 A:middle
you know to be reference types.

00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:48.636 A:middle
Things like NS proxies or core

00:36:48.636 --> 00:36:49.716 A:middle
data managed objects.

00:36:49.956 --> 00:36:52.066 A:middle
And the final time to consider

00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:53.386 A:middle
using them is when you're round

00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:54.816 A:middle
tripping with objective-C code,

00:36:55.216 --> 00:36:56.486 A:middle
but I'd recommend strongly doing

00:36:56.486 --> 00:36:58.416 A:middle
this only after you've measured

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.506 A:middle
and identified that bridging is

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:00.516 A:middle
indeed the culprit for whatever
