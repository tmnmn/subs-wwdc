00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:01.146 A:middle
And you have to be able to do

00:21:01.146 --> 00:21:01.976 A:middle
this in constant time.

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:07.846 A:middle
The next is called a Range

00:21:07.846 --> 00:21:08.856 A:middle
Replaceable Collection, and this

00:21:08.856 --> 00:21:09.726 A:middle
is the kind of collection that

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:11.196 A:middle
you get when you can remove

00:21:11.196 --> 00:21:13.596 A:middle
elements from a collection or

00:21:13.596 --> 00:21:14.196 A:middle
insert them.

00:21:14.326 --> 00:21:16.916 A:middle
And now I want to talk about one

00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:18.326 A:middle
of the questions I get asked all

00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:20.206 A:middle
the time.

00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:21.806 A:middle
Why does my perfectly reasonable

00:21:21.806 --> 00:21:22.646 A:middle
collection code crash?

00:21:23.736 --> 00:21:24.796 A:middle
And like all good question

00:21:24.796 --> 00:21:26.066 A:middle
answers, I almost always follow

00:21:26.066 --> 00:21:26.986 A:middle
up with a few questions of my

00:21:26.986 --> 00:21:27.206 A:middle
own.

00:21:28.436 --> 00:21:29.246 A:middle
Sometimes I start with the

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.186 A:middle
classic, well what are you

00:21:30.186 --> 00:21:30.706 A:middle
trying to do?

00:21:30.896 --> 00:21:32.986 A:middle
And I usually quickly follow up

00:21:32.986 --> 00:21:34.026 A:middle
with, well how are you using

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:34.756 A:middle
your collections?

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:36.056 A:middle
Are you mutating them?

00:21:36.236 --> 00:21:36.786 A:middle
Are you sure you aren't

00:21:36.786 --> 00:21:37.806 A:middle
accessing your collections for

00:21:37.806 --> 00:21:38.366 A:middle
multiple threads?

00:21:38.976 --> 00:21:40.366 A:middle
And I ask these questions

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:42.836 A:middle
because their answers often lead

00:21:42.836 --> 00:21:44.186 A:middle
to the root cause of the

00:21:44.456 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
problem.

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:46.696 A:middle
Well, let's begin with the

00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:47.556 A:middle
assumption that threads aren't

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:47.866 A:middle
involved.

00:21:48.276 --> 00:21:49.146 A:middle
I'm not ready to think about

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:49.516 A:middle
threads yet.

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:51.996 A:middle
It's not even 9:30.

00:21:52.176 --> 00:21:54.026 A:middle
Suppose we had an array, and we

00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:55.716 A:middle
get the index of an element that

00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.576 A:middle
we know is there, in this case

00:21:57.576 --> 00:21:58.076 A:middle
the value e.

00:21:58.346 --> 00:21:59.396 A:middle
And then we mutate the

00:21:59.396 --> 00:22:00.546 A:middle
collection, say by removing its
