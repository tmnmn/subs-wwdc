00:33:59.306 --> 00:34:01.416 A:middle
And the reason for that is that

00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:02.256 A:middle
we're actually bridging our

00:34:02.256 --> 00:34:03.766 A:middle
string multiple times across

00:34:03.766 --> 00:34:04.306 A:middle
languages.

00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:05.976 A:middle
Mutable attributed string is an

00:34:05.976 --> 00:34:08.295 A:middle
objective-C reference type, and

00:34:08.295 --> 00:34:09.766 A:middle
so when we're asking for the

00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:10.826 A:middle
string property, we're actually

00:34:10.826 --> 00:34:11.646 A:middle
having to convert from an

00:34:11.646 --> 00:34:12.366 A:middle
NSString to a string.

00:34:12.585 --> 00:34:15.326 A:middle
And we're doing it once here

00:34:15.326 --> 00:34:16.335 A:middle
when we calculated the first

00:34:16.335 --> 00:34:17.505 A:middle
range, and we're doing it a

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:18.466 A:middle
second time when we convert for

00:34:18.466 --> 00:34:19.166 A:middle
the NSRange.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:21.726 A:middle
You can imagine how expensive

00:34:21.766 --> 00:34:22.996 A:middle
this would be if we did this in

00:34:22.996 --> 00:34:24.505 A:middle
a loop looking for all the text

00:34:24.505 --> 00:34:24.886 A:middle
to color.

00:34:24.886 --> 00:34:26.556 A:middle
Now let's look into why this is

00:34:26.556 --> 00:34:26.946 A:middle
happening.

00:34:27.556 --> 00:34:28.876 A:middle
Every time I call text.string,

00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:30.545 A:middle
we start in a Swift execution

00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:31.106 A:middle
context.

00:34:31.795 --> 00:34:33.025 A:middle
However, the implementation of

00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:34.056 A:middle
NSMutableAttributedString is

00:34:34.056 --> 00:34:35.496 A:middle
objective-C, and so in order to

00:34:35.496 --> 00:34:37.076 A:middle
provide the result, we actually

00:34:37.076 --> 00:34:38.466 A:middle
have to consult the original

00:34:38.466 --> 00:34:39.085 A:middle
implementation.

00:34:40.436 --> 00:34:41.716 A:middle
The original implementation

00:34:41.716 --> 00:34:43.596 A:middle
returns an NSString, which is

00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:44.856 A:middle
the reference type, and so when

00:34:44.856 --> 00:34:46.606 A:middle
return to string, it needs to be

00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:48.996 A:middle
bridged, graphing cluster by

00:34:48.996 --> 00:34:51.295 A:middle
graphing cluster, character by

00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:51.775 A:middle
character.

00:34:51.775 --> 00:34:55.085 A:middle
And bridging happens whether

00:34:55.646 --> 00:34:57.596 A:middle
it's a return type or a

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.000 A:middle
parameter.
