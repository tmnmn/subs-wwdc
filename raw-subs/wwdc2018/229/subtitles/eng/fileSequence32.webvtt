00:31:58.466 --> 00:32:00.206 A:middle
They remain reference types in

00:32:00.206 --> 00:32:00.516 A:middle
Swift.

00:32:00.516 --> 00:32:02.556 A:middle
And so an NSArray of NSViews

00:32:03.186 --> 00:32:04.186 A:middle
will be lazily bridged.

00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:05.436 A:middle
The bridging won't happen until

00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:07.626 A:middle
you first access or try to use

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:08.806 A:middle
that array.

00:32:10.556 --> 00:32:13.066 A:middle
And finally, an NSDictionary

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:15.336 A:middle
with keys that are NS strings

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:17.666 A:middle
will be bridged eagerly because

00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:18.756 A:middle
the strings need to come across

00:32:18.846 --> 00:32:21.346 A:middle
in Swift as value-type strings.

00:32:22.336 --> 00:32:22.996 A:middle
So now that we know what

00:32:22.996 --> 00:32:24.616 A:middle
bridging is, how it works, and

00:32:24.616 --> 00:32:26.166 A:middle
when it happens, we can move on

00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:27.146 A:middle
to the most important question

00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
of all, which is when should you

00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:29.586 A:middle
care about it.

00:32:29.736 --> 00:32:30.506 A:middle
And the answer is really

00:32:30.506 --> 00:32:31.116 A:middle
straightforward.

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:32.466 A:middle
When you measure it negatively

00:32:32.466 --> 00:32:33.966 A:middle
impacting your app.

00:32:35.676 --> 00:32:36.906 A:middle
Specifically, when you take a

00:32:37.026 --> 00:32:37.856 A:middle
time profile or trace an

00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:39.206 A:middle
instrument, pay special

00:32:39.206 --> 00:32:40.416 A:middle
attention to where your code

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:41.736 A:middle
crosses between the languages,

00:32:41.946 --> 00:32:42.956 A:middle
especially when this happens

00:32:42.956 --> 00:32:44.236 A:middle
inside a loop.

00:32:44.956 --> 00:32:45.736 A:middle
Some bridging is going to

00:32:45.736 --> 00:32:47.196 A:middle
happen, and that's totally okay.

00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:48.586 A:middle
What you're looking for though

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:50.456 A:middle
is a disproportionate amount of

00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:51.626 A:middle
time or a surprising amount of

00:32:51.696 --> 00:32:53.106 A:middle
time spent in code that you

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:54.486 A:middle
didn't write that has the word

00:32:54.486 --> 00:32:55.026 A:middle
bridge in it.

00:32:56.556 --> 00:32:57.346 A:middle
Let's look at a concrete

00:32:57.406 --> 00:32:58.376 A:middle
example.

00:32:58.886 --> 00:33:00.186 A:middle
Suppose I have a manuscript for
