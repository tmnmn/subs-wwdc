00:21:59.396 --> 00:22:00.546 A:middle
collection, say by removing its

00:22:00.546 --> 00:22:03.146 A:middle
first element, and we go ahead

00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:04.796 A:middle
and print the element associated

00:22:04.796 --> 00:22:05.576 A:middle
with that index.

00:22:06.206 --> 00:22:07.076 A:middle
Well when we do this,

00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:09.526 A:middle
unfortunately this will produce

00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:10.366 A:middle
a fatal error.

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:13.226 A:middle
The index is no longer valid.

00:22:13.326 --> 00:22:14.826 A:middle
In fact, the index became

00:22:14.826 --> 00:22:16.306 A:middle
invalid the moment we mutated

00:22:16.306 --> 00:22:16.946 A:middle
our collection.

00:22:17.466 --> 00:22:20.676 A:middle
A far safer approach would be to

00:22:20.676 --> 00:22:22.586 A:middle
mutate our collection first and

00:22:22.586 --> 00:22:24.196 A:middle
then calculate the index.

00:22:24.196 --> 00:22:27.356 A:middle
It's worth pointing out that

00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:28.566 A:middle
mutation always invalidates

00:22:28.566 --> 00:22:29.006 A:middle
indices.

00:22:29.066 --> 00:22:30.116 A:middle
This doesn't just apply to

00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:30.496 A:middle
arrays.

00:22:31.146 --> 00:22:32.206 A:middle
Let's take a look at how this

00:22:32.376 --> 00:22:33.266 A:middle
problem could manifest with

00:22:33.266 --> 00:22:33.866 A:middle
dictionaries.

00:22:35.036 --> 00:22:35.816 A:middle
Let's suppose that we have a

00:22:35.816 --> 00:22:36.936 A:middle
dictionary showing a few of a

00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:37.966 A:middle
bear's favorite things.

00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.056 A:middle
We'll grab the index of our

00:22:40.056 --> 00:22:41.586 A:middle
bear's favorite food and print

00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:43.316 A:middle
it out, confirming that, indeed,

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:43.706 A:middle
it's salmon.

00:22:45.036 --> 00:22:46.486 A:middle
Next, we'll add a couple more

00:22:46.486 --> 00:22:47.466 A:middle
favorite things that this bear

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:49.226 A:middle
has, and then we'll make sure

00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:50.106 A:middle
that our favorite food is still

00:22:50.106 --> 00:22:50.376 A:middle
salmon.

00:22:50.376 --> 00:22:52.446 A:middle
And we'll see that, wait a

00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:53.836 A:middle
minute, our favorite good isn't

00:22:53.886 --> 00:22:55.136 A:middle
hibernation, it's salmon.

00:22:55.436 --> 00:22:58.076 A:middle
And just like arrays, we

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.576 A:middle
invalidated our index the moment

00:22:59.576 --> 00:23:00.646 A:middle
we mutated the dictionary.
