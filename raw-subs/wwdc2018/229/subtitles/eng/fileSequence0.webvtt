00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:22.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.346 A:middle
My name is Michael LeHew, and I

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:26.436 A:middle
worked on the collections for

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:27.726 A:middle
the foundations team at Apple.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.876 A:middle
And today, I want to talk about

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:31.946 A:middle
specific things that you should

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:33.036 A:middle
know about to ensure that your

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:34.526 A:middle
use of collections in Swift is

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:35.656 A:middle
as effective as possible.

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.276 A:middle
I'm going to cover a lot of

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:39.856 A:middle
territory today about details

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:42.046 A:middle
and all aspects of collections

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:43.136 A:middle
available for use in Swift.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:44.596 A:middle
We're going to explore some

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.616 A:middle
common pitfalls and how to avoid

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:47.506 A:middle
them including performance

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.756 A:middle
issues, and I'm also going to

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:50.676 A:middle
offer very specific advice about

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:51.936 A:middle
when to choose to use specific

00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:52.366 A:middle
collections.

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:53.996 A:middle
So let's begin.

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:57.336 A:middle
I want you to imagine a world, a

00:00:57.696 --> 00:00:59.176 A:middle
world without collections.

00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:03.146 A:middle
And in this world, we may not
