00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
thread identifier are all

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:01.826 A:middle
grouped together.

00:21:02.296 --> 00:21:02.756 A:middle
That's it.

00:21:03.016 --> 00:21:03.646 A:middle
Super simple.

00:21:06.456 --> 00:21:07.556 A:middle
So, threads make a lot of sense

00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:08.256 A:middle
and you have separate

00:21:08.256 --> 00:21:09.756 A:middle
conversations to group together.

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:11.096 A:middle
But what about other types of

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:11.646 A:middle
content?

00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:12.936 A:middle
How should we handle grouping in

00:21:12.936 --> 00:21:13.436 A:middle
those cases?

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:14.946 A:middle
Well, let's look at news.

00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:16.636 A:middle
Each source is broken out into a

00:21:16.636 --> 00:21:17.346 A:middle
separate thread.

00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:19.426 A:middle
You can see there's a group from

00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:20.406 A:middle
"The New York Times."

00:21:21.356 --> 00:21:23.946 A:middle
A group for Quartz, and a group

00:21:23.946 --> 00:21:25.026 A:middle
from "The Washington Post."

00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:27.746 A:middle
And it's a really helpful way to

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:29.596 A:middle
find and organize content

00:21:29.596 --> 00:21:32.196 A:middle
delivered from the news app.

00:21:32.386 --> 00:21:33.546 A:middle
And let's look at another

00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:33.976 A:middle
example.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.946 A:middle
Podcasts. They really do the

00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:36.716 A:middle
smart thing with their

00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:37.526 A:middle
notifications.

00:21:37.826 --> 00:21:39.946 A:middle
They create a special thread

00:21:39.946 --> 00:21:41.376 A:middle
that groups together all of your

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:42.486 A:middle
new episodes.

00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:44.076 A:middle
And what they do is they

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:45.616 A:middle
resisted the temptation to

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.876 A:middle
declare each individual Podcast

00:21:48.226 --> 00:21:48.936 A:middle
a separate thread.

00:21:49.846 --> 00:21:51.076 A:middle
Because remember, threading is

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:52.186 A:middle
about consolidating and

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:53.406 A:middle
organizing your content.

00:21:54.016 --> 00:21:54.776 A:middle
So, when scrolling through your

00:21:54.776 --> 00:21:56.046 A:middle
notification history, I think

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:57.596 A:middle
it's a much better experience to

00:21:57.596 --> 00:21:59.976 A:middle
see all new Podcast episodes in

00:21:59.976 --> 00:22:01.776 A:middle
a single group, rather than a
