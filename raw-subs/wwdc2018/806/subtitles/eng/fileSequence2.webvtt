00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.466 A:middle
glance and choose the specific

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.786 A:middle
one they wanted to interact

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
with.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.796 A:middle
A swipe on that row would launch

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:05.346 A:middle
into the app but all the other

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:06.586 A:middle
ones would be dismissed from the

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:07.126 A:middle
lock screen.

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
And they all went up to

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.056 A:middle
notification center.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:11.536 A:middle
And that was a way to access all

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:12.526 A:middle
the other things you had missed.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:14.646 A:middle
So, because so many

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:15.646 A:middle
notifications were being

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
accumulated, this became a

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.766 A:middle
really useful place to go and to

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.616 A:middle
see all the other activity on

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:22.676 A:middle
your phone.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.506 A:middle
Next, we introduced rich

00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:25.196 A:middle
notifications.

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:27.606 A:middle
As the quantity of notifications

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.536 A:middle
was increasing, we wanted to

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:30.666 A:middle
increase their quality.

00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:32.786 A:middle
Rich notifications are a great

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.266 A:middle
way to provide more context and

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.806 A:middle
information around each

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:36.496 A:middle
notification.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:38.116 A:middle
That way you can see one,

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:39.996 A:middle
understand what it's for and get

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:41.176 A:middle
the extra information that you

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.526 A:middle
need to take action.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.116 A:middle
And it all happens right in

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:44.366 A:middle
line.

00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:45.976 A:middle
You don't need to launch into

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.226 A:middle
the app and lose the context of

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:47.826 A:middle
what you're doing.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.256 A:middle
And that leads us to where we

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:51.816 A:middle
are today and all the work that

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.836 A:middle
we've done to enhance the

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.786 A:middle
notification experience in iOS

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:55.036 A:middle
12.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.456 A:middle
So, we're going to talk about

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:58.266 A:middle
some features that make the

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.166 A:middle
world better for you, as app
