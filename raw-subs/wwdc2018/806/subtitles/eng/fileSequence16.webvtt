00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:00.806 A:middle
But with the new tuning features

00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:02.366 A:middle
we announced, if I get annoyed

00:16:02.366 --> 00:16:03.826 A:middle
by those notifications, I can

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:05.666 A:middle
easily turn them all off.

00:16:06.346 --> 00:16:07.936 A:middle
So, for them, doing the right

00:16:07.976 --> 00:16:09.846 A:middle
thing in the short term, while

00:16:09.846 --> 00:16:11.046 A:middle
it might seem like the harder

00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:12.686 A:middle
decision to make, I think it's

00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:13.676 A:middle
going to pay off in the long

00:16:13.676 --> 00:16:13.896 A:middle
run.

00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:16.586 A:middle
So, in all cases, it's really

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
important to consider how and

00:16:18.536 --> 00:16:19.656 A:middle
when you're delivering

00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:20.506 A:middle
notifications.

00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:23.746 A:middle
And finally, we want to make

00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:25.116 A:middle
sure your people are in control

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:26.186 A:middle
of the content that they're

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:26.726 A:middle
receiving.

00:16:26.946 --> 00:16:28.136 A:middle
I mean there's a real trust

00:16:28.136 --> 00:16:29.376 A:middle
relationship that's created when

00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:30.546 A:middle
someone allows notifications

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:31.106 A:middle
from your app.

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:33.186 A:middle
They're making space for you to

00:16:33.186 --> 00:16:33.986 A:middle
interrupt them with your

00:16:33.986 --> 00:16:34.856 A:middle
content, right?

00:16:35.296 --> 00:16:36.356 A:middle
And as we've discussed, it

00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:37.856 A:middle
should be really valuable.

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:40.446 A:middle
But not all things have that

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:41.716 A:middle
same level of value or

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:43.606 A:middle
importance to all people.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:45.396 A:middle
So, let's talk about giving

00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:46.706 A:middle
everyone control on how their

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:48.086 A:middle
content is delivered, right?

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:49.486 A:middle
So, we've redesigned settings

00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:50.786 A:middle
this year to more clearly

00:16:50.786 --> 00:16:52.676 A:middle
visualize the different delivery

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:53.856 A:middle
methods of notifications.

00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:55.736 A:middle
We hope that with more clear and

00:16:55.736 --> 00:16:57.876 A:middle
graphic UI, it will make it

00:16:57.876 --> 00:16:59.306 A:middle
easier for people to adjust how

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:00.246 A:middle
they're receiving your different
