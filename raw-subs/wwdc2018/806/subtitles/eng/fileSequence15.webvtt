00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.296 A:middle
So, I think it's appropriate

00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:02.026 A:middle
that they let me choose when a

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:02.916 A:middle
reminder comes through.

00:15:03.156 --> 00:15:03.956 A:middle
Because it would be terribly

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:05.766 A:middle
ironic if they were the ones

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:06.716 A:middle
sending me frustrating

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.586 A:middle
notifications at inopportune

00:15:08.586 --> 00:15:09.556 A:middle
times throughout the day.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.046 A:middle
Headspace is really great.

00:15:12.276 --> 00:15:13.486 A:middle
And here, I love this screen

00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:14.326 A:middle
with CNN, right.

00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:16.516 A:middle
After you allow alerts, they ask

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:17.536 A:middle
you to choose the alert

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:18.226 A:middle
frequency.

00:15:18.726 --> 00:15:20.006 A:middle
So, it's up to me to decide how

00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.336 A:middle
often I would like to receive

00:15:21.336 --> 00:15:21.996 A:middle
their content.

00:15:22.246 --> 00:15:23.656 A:middle
It's such as smart way to manage

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.026 A:middle
and configure your notifications

00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:25.276 A:middle
you know.

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:26.856 A:middle
Because as a user, now I have

00:15:26.856 --> 00:15:28.276 A:middle
some expectations around what

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:29.576 A:middle
that notification experience

00:15:29.576 --> 00:15:29.916 A:middle
will be.

00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:32.746 A:middle
And here's a notifications from

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:33.326 A:middle
Duolingo.

00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:36.436 A:middle
So, I was trying to learn a new

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:36.926 A:middle
language.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:38.646 A:middle
I got a bit distracted here

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.986 A:middle
working on this presentation, so

00:15:39.986 --> 00:15:40.936 A:middle
I missed a few sessions.

00:15:41.446 --> 00:15:42.766 A:middle
And rather than continuing to

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.186 A:middle
send me notifications that I'm

00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:45.826 A:middle
not interacting with, they

00:15:45.826 --> 00:15:46.716 A:middle
decided to pause them.

00:15:47.736 --> 00:15:49.216 A:middle
And I just think that's really

00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:49.816 A:middle
considerate.

00:15:50.236 --> 00:15:51.326 A:middle
Because I could totally

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.546 A:middle
understand the argument right,

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.776 A:middle
why they might want to send me

00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:55.586 A:middle
more notifications at a time

00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:56.936 A:middle
like this and really encourage

00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:58.416 A:middle
me to get back and re-engage

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:58.976 A:middle
with the app.

00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:00.806 A:middle
But with the new tuning features
