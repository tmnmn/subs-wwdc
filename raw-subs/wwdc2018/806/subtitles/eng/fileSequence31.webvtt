00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:01.626 A:middle
You can add a sash color.

00:31:02.066 --> 00:31:03.636 A:middle
You can add a background color.

00:31:04.626 --> 00:31:06.646 A:middle
You can add images, icons and

00:31:06.646 --> 00:31:08.476 A:middle
even inline video to make your

00:31:08.476 --> 00:31:09.976 A:middle
notifications more visually

00:31:10.706 --> 00:31:10.826 A:middle
rich.

00:31:12.626 --> 00:31:14.406 A:middle
Okay, and now if you have a

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:15.896 A:middle
WatchKit app you can create

00:31:15.896 --> 00:31:17.176 A:middle
interactive notifications.

00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:19.016 A:middle
Interactive notifications are a

00:31:19.016 --> 00:31:20.826 A:middle
new feature in WatchOS 5.

00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:21.986 A:middle
They allow for more

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:23.206 A:middle
interactivity right in the

00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:24.896 A:middle
notification, so you don't even

00:31:24.896 --> 00:31:25.636 A:middle
have to launch the app.

00:31:25.986 --> 00:31:26.816 A:middle
We're really excited about this

00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:26.956 A:middle
one.

00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:31.536 A:middle
Okay, so here's a notification

00:31:31.536 --> 00:31:32.986 A:middle
from a fictitious ride sharing

00:31:32.986 --> 00:31:33.226 A:middle
app.

00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:34.496 A:middle
You guys know this.

00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:35.846 A:middle
We all get these after every

00:31:35.846 --> 00:31:36.516 A:middle
single ride.

00:31:36.896 --> 00:31:38.166 A:middle
And occasionally I'll open the

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:39.546 A:middle
app and rate the ride right

00:31:39.546 --> 00:31:40.776 A:middle
after the ride is over.

00:31:41.336 --> 00:31:43.836 A:middle
But sometimes, actually a lot of

00:31:43.836 --> 00:31:45.566 A:middle
times, I forget to do it.

00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:49.246 A:middle
So, now in WatchOS 5 apps can

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:49.956 A:middle
create interactive

00:31:49.996 --> 00:31:50.826 A:middle
notifications.

00:31:51.356 --> 00:31:52.926 A:middle
Here's one from DiDi, I ride

00:31:52.926 --> 00:31:53.406 A:middle
sharing app.

00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:55.446 A:middle
So, they've included the ability

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:56.986 A:middle
to rate and pay right in the

00:31:56.986 --> 00:31:57.726 A:middle
notification.

00:31:58.056 --> 00:32:00.316 A:middle
I just have to rotate the
