&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.066 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:28.956 A:middle
How's it going.

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:31.106 A:middle
It's nice to see everyone today.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.336 A:middle
Hopefully you've enjoyed the

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:33.256 A:middle
conference this week.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:35.896 A:middle
We're really happy to be here to

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:36.966 A:middle

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:40.356 A:middle
later I'll be joined by my

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:41.716 A:middle
colleague Heena Ko.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.366 A:middle

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:51.416 A:middle

notification experience, both

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:57.636 A:middle
