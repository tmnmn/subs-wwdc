00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
At the same time, they're

00:34:00.256 --> 00:34:00.866 A:middle
succinct.

00:34:03.236 --> 00:34:04.476 A:middle
They were visually rich.

00:34:04.596 --> 00:34:06.386 A:middle
These used images, videos, and

00:34:06.386 --> 00:34:08.146 A:middle
icons to make the notifications

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.166 A:middle
much visually richer.

00:34:11.576 --> 00:34:12.606 A:middle
They're actionable.

00:34:12.606 --> 00:34:14.656 A:middle
I was able to accomplish a tone

00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:16.156 A:middle
of things without even having to

00:34:16.156 --> 00:34:19.106 A:middle
open the app.

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:21.096 A:middle
And lastly, interactions on the

00:34:21.096 --> 00:34:22.136 A:middle
watch are best when they're

00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:22.255 A:middle
quick.

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:23.255 A:middle
We're going to make

00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:24.716 A:middle
notifications richer, but we

00:34:24.716 --> 00:34:25.676 A:middle
don't want to recreate the app

00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:25.976 A:middle
experience.

00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:31.686 A:middle
Okay, something you can do to

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:33.085 A:middle
make notifications even more

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.755 A:middle
effective is to get to know your

00:34:34.755 --> 00:34:34.985 A:middle
audience.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:38.036 A:middle
And tailor notifications to

00:34:38.036 --> 00:34:38.636 A:middle
individuals.

00:34:38.636 --> 00:34:40.085 A:middle
It can make a huge difference in

00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:43.366 A:middle
how they experience your app.

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.216 A:middle
My Weather is an adorable app

00:34:45.295 --> 00:34:46.295 A:middle
that sends me forecast

00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:48.025 A:middle
notifications every morning and

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.596 A:middle
it's customized to my location.

00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:54.376 A:middle
I really love receiving

00:34:54.376 --> 00:34:55.996 A:middle
notifications from Wallet on my

00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:56.456 A:middle
watch.

00:34:57.025 --> 00:34:57.986 A:middle
It's especially great, when

00:34:57.986 --> 00:34:58.896 A:middle
you're at the airport, and

00:34:58.896 --> 00:34:59.686 A:middle
you're dealing with lots of

00:34:59.686 --> 00:34:59.946 A:middle
luggage.

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.226 A:middle
Or you're at the store dealing
