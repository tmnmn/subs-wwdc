00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.136 A:middle
But remember, only create

00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:02.396 A:middle
threads when necessary.

00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:04.106 A:middle
Don't overdo it.

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.886 A:middle
And finally, rich notifications

00:27:07.296 --> 00:27:08.496 A:middle
should be created to provide

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:10.036 A:middle
that extra bit of content around

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:10.786 A:middle
the notification.

00:27:12.206 --> 00:27:13.336 A:middle
Each notification should be a

00:27:13.336 --> 00:27:14.926 A:middle
specific task to complete.

00:27:16.076 --> 00:27:18.096 A:middle
You can add images, video,

00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:19.816 A:middle
audio, and custom content.

00:27:20.146 --> 00:27:22.986 A:middle
And now, interactivity to create

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:24.606 A:middle
a holistic notification

00:27:24.606 --> 00:27:25.156 A:middle
experience.

00:27:25.296 --> 00:27:29.496 A:middle
So, I mean that was a lot,

00:27:29.496 --> 00:27:29.736 A:middle
right?

00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:30.956 A:middle
That was a lot to take in, a lot

00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:32.566 A:middle
to do, a lot to consider.

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:33.896 A:middle
But, it's not everything.

00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:35.336 A:middle
There's still something else to

00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:35.896 A:middle
consider.

00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:38.106 A:middle
And for a lot of people it's the

00:27:38.106 --> 00:27:39.066 A:middle
most important.

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.546 A:middle
And it's definitely the most

00:27:40.706 --> 00:27:41.886 A:middle
personal part of the

00:27:41.886 --> 00:27:43.096 A:middle
notification experience.

00:27:44.146 --> 00:27:44.786 A:middle
The Apple Watch.

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.496 A:middle
So, I'd like to invite my fellow

00:27:46.496 --> 00:27:48.366 A:middle
designer, Heena Ko here, to talk

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.006 A:middle
about making great notifications

00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:50.986 A:middle
on the Apple Watch.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:51.896 A:middle
Thank you.

00:27:52.516 --> 00:27:57.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:57.636 --> 00:27:58.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jon.

00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:03.826 A:middle
Okay. So, we just heard about
