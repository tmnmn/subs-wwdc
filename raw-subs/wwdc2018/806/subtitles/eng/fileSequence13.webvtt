[ding].

00:13:01.036 --> 00:13:01.736 A:middle
You're interrupted.

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.126 A:middle
And you stop.

00:13:03.126 --> 00:13:04.416 A:middle
And you lose focus.

00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:06.246 A:middle
And when the wrong thing comes

00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:07.366 A:middle
at the wrong time it's

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:07.946 A:middle
frustrating.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.306 A:middle
So, you've got to be extra

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.736 A:middle
considerate when we're sending

00:13:10.736 --> 00:13:11.426 A:middle
notifications.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.386 A:middle
First off, we need to make sure

00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:17.206 A:middle
we're sending great content and

00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:18.686 A:middle
providing the highest quality of

00:13:18.686 --> 00:13:19.196 A:middle
information.

00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:20.216 A:middle
Everything you said in a

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.696 A:middle
notification has got to be

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:22.216 A:middle
meaningful.

00:13:22.956 --> 00:13:23.946 A:middle
Every notification should

00:13:23.946 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
provide a specific purpose.

00:13:25.726 --> 00:13:26.726 A:middle
Each notification should have a

00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:28.426 A:middle
specific message to communicate

00:13:28.426 --> 00:13:29.566 A:middle
or a task to complete.

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.306 A:middle
Notifications are not just a

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:32.696 A:middle
reason to get people to launch

00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:33.346 A:middle
into your app.

00:13:34.916 --> 00:13:36.256 A:middle
So, Dark Sky, it's a really

00:13:36.256 --> 00:13:37.666 A:middle
lovely weather app that sends

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:38.626 A:middle
particularly meaningful

00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:39.356 A:middle
notifications.

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:41.826 A:middle
See, I think the interesting

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:43.786 A:middle
thing about the weather is you

00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:45.756 A:middle
really need to know about the

00:13:45.756 --> 00:13:47.346 A:middle
weather once it's different.

00:13:47.436 --> 00:13:48.516 A:middle
You know, if there's a change in

00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:49.136 A:middle
conditions.

00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:50.916 A:middle
And that's when Dark Sky sends

00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:51.946 A:middle
these notifications, right?

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:52.986 A:middle
Rain is starting soon.

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:54.056 A:middle
That's what I need to know.

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:54.986 A:middle
Just really smart.

00:13:56.316 --> 00:13:57.996 A:middle
Door Dash is another great

00:13:57.996 --> 00:13:58.436 A:middle
example.

00:13:59.016 --> 00:14:01.566 A:middle
You get your notification when
