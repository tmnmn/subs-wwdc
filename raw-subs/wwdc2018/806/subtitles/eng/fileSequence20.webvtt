00:19:58.466 --> 00:20:01.016 A:middle
A simple tap on each group

00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:02.496 A:middle
expands it open and you can

00:20:02.496 --> 00:20:04.206 A:middle
interact with each notification

00:20:04.426 --> 00:20:04.956 A:middle
individually.

00:20:05.386 --> 00:20:07.196 A:middle
And by default, notifications

00:20:07.196 --> 00:20:08.646 A:middle
will group together by app.

00:20:09.246 --> 00:20:11.226 A:middle
And for most cases, that make

00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:11.796 A:middle
sense.

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:13.716 A:middle
But you know there's some

00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:14.946 A:middle
circumstances when sorting them

00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:16.736 A:middle
out in a more detailed way can

00:20:16.736 --> 00:20:17.286 A:middle
be helpful.

00:20:17.376 --> 00:20:19.236 A:middle
And messages is a perfect

00:20:19.236 --> 00:20:19.686 A:middle
example.

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:21.136 A:middle
I don't think it would be the

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:22.646 A:middle
most useful thing to see every

00:20:22.646 --> 00:20:23.916 A:middle
missed message from every

00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:25.376 A:middle
conversation thread and group

00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:26.786 A:middle
chat you're having all lumped

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:28.176 A:middle
together into a single group.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.356 A:middle
So, to more clearly organize

00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:32.136 A:middle
everything we create a new group

00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:33.486 A:middle
for each conversation.

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:34.836 A:middle
And we call each individual

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:35.866 A:middle
group a thread.

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.696 A:middle
So, let's take a moment and talk

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.556 A:middle
about notification threads and

00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:41.896 A:middle
what the best ways may be to

00:20:41.896 --> 00:20:42.886 A:middle
organize your content.

00:20:43.336 --> 00:20:44.686 A:middle
So, notification grouping uses

00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:46.276 A:middle
the existing thread identifier

00:20:46.276 --> 00:20:46.636 A:middle
API.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.016 A:middle
This API was introduced as part

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.326 A:middle
of the notification content

00:20:50.326 --> 00:20:50.956 A:middle
extensions.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:53.366 A:middle
We expanded its use to create

00:20:53.366 --> 00:20:54.326 A:middle
notification groups.

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:56.736 A:middle
The thread identifier can be any

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:58.256 A:middle
string that you want and the

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.626 A:middle
notifications with the same

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
thread identifier are all
