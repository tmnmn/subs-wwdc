00:33:00.406 --> 00:33:03.096 A:middle
So, here's an interactive

00:33:03.096 --> 00:33:04.586 A:middle
notification from Yelp, letting

00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:06.096 A:middle
me know that my table is ready.

00:33:06.666 --> 00:33:09.746 A:middle
And these new notifications,

00:33:09.856 --> 00:33:11.166 A:middle
they allow me to extend my

00:33:11.216 --> 00:33:12.736 A:middle
checking time and in this one,

00:33:12.736 --> 00:33:14.586 A:middle
for up to 45 minutes right in

00:33:14.586 --> 00:33:15.366 A:middle
the notification.

00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:16.806 A:middle
So, we don't need to give up our

00:33:16.806 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
table if people are running

00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:18.396 A:middle
late.

00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:24.646 A:middle
Okay, so rich notifications are

00:33:24.646 --> 00:33:26.116 A:middle
particularly good for moments of

00:33:26.116 --> 00:33:27.126 A:middle
quick data input.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:28.786 A:middle
Here's a notification from a

00:33:28.786 --> 00:33:30.236 A:middle
fictitious medication reminder

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:30.476 A:middle
app.

00:33:31.046 --> 00:33:31.976 A:middle
It's reminding me to take my

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:33.386 A:middle
medication before the end of the

00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:33.676 A:middle
day.

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:37.186 A:middle
So, it not only reminds me to

00:33:37.186 --> 00:33:38.246 A:middle
take my medication at the right

00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.266 A:middle
time, but it also provides a

00:33:40.346 --> 00:33:41.606 A:middle
range of ways to respond.

00:33:41.716 --> 00:33:42.996 A:middle
I can say I took a single

00:33:42.996 --> 00:33:44.336 A:middle
medication, or I can tap the

00:33:44.336 --> 00:33:45.686 A:middle
take all button to say that I've

00:33:45.686 --> 00:33:46.246 A:middle
taken both.

00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:48.396 A:middle
So, this is really great,

00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:49.456 A:middle
because this is something that I

00:33:49.456 --> 00:33:50.736 A:middle
had to do every single day.

00:33:54.246 --> 00:33:55.596 A:middle
Okay, so what do these

00:33:55.596 --> 00:33:56.766 A:middle
notifications have in common?

00:33:57.266 --> 00:33:58.646 A:middle
Well, they were informative.

00:33:59.216 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
At the same time, they're
