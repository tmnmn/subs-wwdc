00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
So, at the top, the first option

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:03.246 A:middle
is to deliver quietly.

00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:05.066 A:middle
And these quiet notifications

00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:06.976 A:middle
will be send directly into your

00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:08.406 A:middle
notification center without

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:08.926 A:middle
interruption.

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:10.286 A:middle
It did not appear on the lock

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:10.696 A:middle
screen.

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:12.386 A:middle
It did not play a sound or

00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:14.386 A:middle
haptic, or present as banners.

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:15.666 A:middle
And I think this is a really

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
great option for an app that's

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:18.536 A:middle
sending you notifications that

00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:19.056 A:middle
you want.

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:20.816 A:middle
Content that you're interested

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:22.376 A:middle
in, but you don't necessarily

00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:24.246 A:middle
need to be interrupted by for

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:25.246 A:middle
every new post, right?

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:26.446 A:middle
So, you can access these

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:28.296 A:middle
notifications now on your own

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:28.736 A:middle
terms.

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.876 A:middle
But also, right here in the card

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:33.876 A:middle
is a button to turn off all

00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:35.236 A:middle
notifications from that

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:35.936 A:middle
particular app.

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:38.226 A:middle
And we think having that

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
shortcut is really handy.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:41.736 A:middle
But having to use it, it's not a

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:43.156 A:middle
great experience for anyone.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.646 A:middle
We don't want people to have to

00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:45.936 A:middle
turn off notifications because

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:47.436 A:middle
they're annoyed or frustrated.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.396 A:middle
And as developers you don't want

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:50.536 A:middle
to lose the privilege to reach

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:52.056 A:middle
out to those individuals, right?

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:53.676 A:middle
So, by the time we're done here,

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:54.476 A:middle
we want to make sure that you

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:55.406 A:middle
have all the tools and

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:56.936 A:middle
information you need to make

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:57.816 A:middle
sure you're sending only the

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.506 A:middle
most meaningful notifications

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
that you can.
