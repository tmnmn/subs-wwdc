00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:00.486 A:middle
your content, you can also have

00:25:00.486 --> 00:25:02.516 A:middle
a threaded or consolidated rich

00:25:02.516 --> 00:25:03.206 A:middle
notification.

00:25:03.796 --> 00:25:04.906 A:middle
So, if we look at Podcasts.

00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:06.566 A:middle
All of their new episodes are

00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:07.996 A:middle
grouped together here on the

00:25:07.996 --> 00:25:08.546 A:middle
lock screen.

00:25:09.326 --> 00:25:10.646 A:middle
When I press on that stack, I

00:25:10.646 --> 00:25:12.186 A:middle
get a single rich notification

00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:13.756 A:middle
that summarizes each of the new

00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:15.426 A:middle
Podcast episodes that have been

00:25:15.426 --> 00:25:15.846 A:middle
released.

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:17.856 A:middle
There's a custom design with

00:25:17.856 --> 00:25:18.806 A:middle
each show's artwork.

00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:21.376 A:middle
The episode title and a short

00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:21.906 A:middle
description.

00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:23.786 A:middle
And because we can have discrete

00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:25.416 A:middle
tap regions, there are separate

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:27.086 A:middle
play buttons for each episode.

00:25:27.636 --> 00:25:28.546 A:middle
I mean, I just think this

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:29.446 A:middle
example is great.

00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:30.756 A:middle
It checks all the boxes for

00:25:30.756 --> 00:25:32.196 A:middle
making a great rich

00:25:32.306 --> 00:25:32.976 A:middle
notification.

00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:35.086 A:middle
There's detailed content, nice

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.526 A:middle
images, custom controls, and

00:25:37.526 --> 00:25:38.376 A:middle
rich interactions.

00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:41.146 A:middle
It's a great way to finish the

00:25:41.146 --> 00:25:42.736 A:middle
notification experience.

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:47.116 A:middle
So, to summarize, when it comes

00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:48.646 A:middle
to that first run experience,

00:25:48.646 --> 00:25:50.416 A:middle
you have the question, did you

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:51.836 A:middle
ask for lock screen access, or

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:52.996 A:middle
deliver quietly in the

00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:53.836 A:middle
notification center.

00:25:54.226 --> 00:25:55.266 A:middle
Well, I think it depends on your

00:25:55.266 --> 00:25:55.766 A:middle
content.

00:25:56.176 --> 00:25:56.956 A:middle
Is it timely?

00:25:57.786 --> 00:25:59.216 A:middle
Does it require an urgent

00:25:59.216 --> 00:25:59.846 A:middle
response?
