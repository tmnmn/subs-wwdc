00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
apps, games.

00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:02.856 A:middle
And let's focus on a news app

00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:03.416 A:middle
for a moment.

00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:04.986 A:middle
Let's imagine we're creating a

00:09:04.986 --> 00:09:07.816 A:middle
new news service from scratch

00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:08.526 A:middle
and we're working out our

00:09:08.526 --> 00:09:09.286 A:middle
notifications.

00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:11.166 A:middle
Well, should we go to the

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:12.316 A:middle
directed notification center

00:09:12.316 --> 00:09:12.426 A:middle
route?

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:13.916 A:middle
I mean that seems like a good

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:14.586 A:middle
idea, right?

00:09:14.906 --> 00:09:15.816 A:middle
I mean there's a group of people

00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:16.876 A:middle
out there that are interested in

00:09:16.876 --> 00:09:17.326 A:middle
news.

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.476 A:middle
Maybe they're curious about

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:19.526 A:middle
what's going on in the world.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:20.856 A:middle
But they don't feel the need to

00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:22.356 A:middle
be interrupted for every single

00:09:22.356 --> 00:09:23.396 A:middle
article that's posted.

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:24.646 A:middle
You know, especially if they've

00:09:24.646 --> 00:09:25.676 A:middle
just downloaded the app and

00:09:25.676 --> 00:09:26.716 A:middle
they're unsure of the content

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:27.446 A:middle
they might receive.

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
I think the directed history

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:32.046 A:middle
route makes a lot of sense.

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:33.716 A:middle
But, you know I also see a very

00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:35.186 A:middle
clear use case to ask for lock

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:36.426 A:middle
screen access too, right?

00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:37.936 A:middle
People love breaking news.

00:09:38.136 --> 00:09:39.116 A:middle
They want to be on top of what's

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:40.666 A:middle
going on in the world, as soon

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:41.616 A:middle
as it happens, right?

00:09:41.776 --> 00:09:44.746 A:middle
I get it. So, what do we do?

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:46.926 A:middle
Well, if we start with the new

00:09:46.926 --> 00:09:48.206 A:middle
world and talk about the cases

00:09:48.206 --> 00:09:49.526 A:middle
that could be sent directly to

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:50.446 A:middle
notification center.

00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:53.536 A:middle
So, if your app is sending

00:09:53.536 --> 00:09:54.806 A:middle
content that can be consumed

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.706 A:middle
passively, and doesn't require

00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:58.386 A:middle
critical or timely responses,

00:09:58.626 --> 00:09:59.446 A:middle
then I think the directed

00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.766 A:middle
notification center route is
