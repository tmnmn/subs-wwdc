00:29:57.316 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
and stay connected.

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:02.996 A:middle
Okay, so you may ask, how do I

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.946 A:middle
make them look great on both

00:30:03.946 --> 00:30:04.556 A:middle
devices?

00:30:05.286 --> 00:30:07.186 A:middle
Well, we try to make it as easy

00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:08.886 A:middle
as possible for you by giving

00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:09.726 A:middle
you some stuff for free.

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:11.906 A:middle
So, let's take a look.

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:14.876 A:middle
Take this notification from one

00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:16.266 A:middle
of my favorite Podcast Apps

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:16.926 A:middle
Castro.

00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:20.396 A:middle
When that phone notification is

00:30:20.496 --> 00:30:21.826 A:middle
pushed to the watch, some

00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:23.036 A:middle
elements come with it with

00:30:23.206 --> 00:30:23.806 A:middle
minimal work.

00:30:24.336 --> 00:30:27.026 A:middle
Like, the image attachments, as

00:30:27.076 --> 00:30:34.166 A:middle
well as the title, the body, and

00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:36.156 A:middle
any relevant quick actions.

00:30:36.966 --> 00:30:39.246 A:middle
So, here I'm able to add this

00:30:39.356 --> 00:30:40.676 A:middle
Podcast app to my queue from my

00:30:40.676 --> 00:30:42.456 A:middle
watch, so it's right in my phone

00:30:42.456 --> 00:30:45.846 A:middle
when I want to listen to it.

00:30:46.356 --> 00:30:47.466 A:middle
By simply adding a few

00:30:47.466 --> 00:30:49.036 A:middle
additional elements, the watch's

00:30:49.106 --> 00:30:50.896 A:middle
notification experience is so

00:30:51.936 --> 00:30:54.906 A:middle
much better.

00:30:55.096 --> 00:30:56.406 A:middle
Okay, so there are additional

00:30:56.406 --> 00:30:57.766 A:middle
ways you can customize your

00:30:57.766 --> 00:30:58.706 A:middle
watch notifications.

00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:01.626 A:middle
You can add a sash color.
