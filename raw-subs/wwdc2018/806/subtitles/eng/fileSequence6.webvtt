00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:00.096 A:middle
that you can.

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:02.406 A:middle
Because if you send great

00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
notifications, you'll be, making

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.016 A:middle
everyone who uses your app

00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:05.376 A:middle
happy.

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:07.126 A:middle
And if you've got happy people

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:08.616 A:middle
using your app, that's going to

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:09.396 A:middle
make you happy.

00:06:10.066 --> 00:06:11.396 A:middle
And if you guys are all happy

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:12.416 A:middle
and they're happy, that's going

00:06:12.416 --> 00:06:13.666 A:middle
to make Heena and I real happy

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:14.026 A:middle
today.

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:15.996 A:middle
And being happy is good, right?

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:18.836 A:middle
So, let's get into it and talk

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.116 A:middle
through the notification journey

00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:21.216 A:middle
and how to create the best

00:06:21.216 --> 00:06:22.506 A:middle
notification experience.

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:24.146 A:middle
We're going to start with the

00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:25.336 A:middle
first run prompt, in that

00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:27.476 A:middle
initial agreement and talk about

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.616 A:middle
all the best ways for you to

00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:29.916 A:middle
make sure your notifications are

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:31.206 A:middle
allowed and delivered.

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:33.666 A:middle
Then we'll talk about the best

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:35.216 A:middle
ways to provide value with all

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:36.116 A:middle
the notifications that you're

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:36.526 A:middle
sending.

00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:39.016 A:middle
Better ways to organize your

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:40.526 A:middle
content with notification

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:40.926 A:middle
grouping.

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:42.516 A:middle
And finally, how to make the

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:44.386 A:middle
most of rich notifications to

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:45.826 A:middle
create a really useful and

00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:47.126 A:middle
holistic notification

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:47.706 A:middle
experience.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.916 A:middle
So, let's get started and talk

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:51.226 A:middle
about that first prompt in

00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:52.266 A:middle
asking for permission to send

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:52.896 A:middle
notifications.

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.006 A:middle
This is a familiar screen,

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:55.356 A:middle
right?

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:57.436 A:middle
It's your one and only

00:06:57.436 --> 00:06:58.666 A:middle
opportunity to receive

00:06:58.736 --> 00:06:59.516 A:middle
permission to send

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:00.176 A:middle
notifications.
