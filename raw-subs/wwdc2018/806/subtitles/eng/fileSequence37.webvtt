00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.766 A:middle
making human connections and

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:01.736 A:middle
conversation.

00:37:02.926 --> 00:37:04.276 A:middle
They're also about delivering

00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:05.586 A:middle
valuable information.

00:37:08.296 --> 00:37:09.686 A:middle
Consider delivery.

00:37:11.496 --> 00:37:12.986 A:middle
Consider providing ways for

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:14.016 A:middle
people to customizing

00:37:14.126 --> 00:37:15.786 A:middle
notifications and incorporate

00:37:15.786 --> 00:37:17.206 A:middle
things like time and location

00:37:17.206 --> 00:37:18.726 A:middle
when sending them.

00:37:19.486 --> 00:37:21.096 A:middle
Okay, notification grouping.

00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:25.666 A:middle
So, iOS and WatchOS will group

00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.756 A:middle
notifications by app by default.

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:28.986 A:middle
And most of the time, that

00:37:28.986 --> 00:37:30.086 A:middle
should be totally okay.

00:37:30.656 --> 00:37:32.316 A:middle
But consider threading related

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:33.546 A:middle
content to have discrete

00:37:33.546 --> 00:37:34.616 A:middle
meaningful groupings.

00:37:35.216 --> 00:37:36.426 A:middle
People are really excited about

00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:36.746 A:middle
this one.

00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:40.726 A:middle
Okay, rich notifications.

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:44.136 A:middle
Consider creating rich education

00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:45.566 A:middle
so people can accomplish more

00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:46.506 A:middle
right in the moment.

00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:50.796 A:middle
And last, but not least,

00:37:52.516 --> 00:37:54.126 A:middle
consider notifications on both

00:37:54.126 --> 00:37:54.686 A:middle
devices.

00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:56.056 A:middle
You'll be providing a great

00:37:56.056 --> 00:37:57.786 A:middle
experience in any circumstance.

00:37:58.316 --> 00:38:01.316 A:middle
So, the next time people hear
