00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:00.766 A:middle
notification center route is

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.656 A:middle
your best approach.

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.116 A:middle
It ensures that your content is

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:03.676 A:middle
delivered.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:04.856 A:middle
It won't interrupt people.

00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:06.686 A:middle
And most importantly, it gives

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:08.346 A:middle
them an opportunity to see your

00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:09.556 A:middle
content and try your

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:10.916 A:middle
notifications before they have

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:11.656 A:middle
to commit to it.

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:13.796 A:middle
So, if our news app is sending

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:15.616 A:middle
longform articles, I think that

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:16.416 A:middle
makes sense, right?

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:17.666 A:middle
Or, social apps.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:18.766 A:middle
I think they can deliver their

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.826 A:middle
likes and comments quietly.

00:10:21.236 --> 00:10:22.456 A:middle
Games that are sending out

00:10:22.506 --> 00:10:23.636 A:middle
promotional notification.

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:25.766 A:middle
Examples like that, I think they

00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:27.246 A:middle
make sense to go direct to

00:10:27.246 --> 00:10:28.036 A:middle
notification center.

00:10:28.036 --> 00:10:31.156 A:middle
Now let's take a moment and talk

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
about the traditional route.

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:34.056 A:middle
What sort of use cases make

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:34.586 A:middle
sense here?

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.366 A:middle
Well, if your apps need to

00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:37.996 A:middle
deliver notification content

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:39.846 A:middle
immediately, if people need to

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:40.996 A:middle
see your notifications the

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:42.436 A:middle
moment that they're posted.

00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:44.486 A:middle
Or your app requires an urgent

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.566 A:middle
response to notifications, ask

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:47.226 A:middle
for permission.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.716 A:middle
You know, maybe that news app is

00:10:49.906 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
breaking news.

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.796 A:middle
Or your social app has a big

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:54.776 A:middle
messaging component, or games

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:55.426 A:middle
where you need to see your

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:56.196 A:middle
friends online.

00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:57.586 A:middle
If you've got an app like that,

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:59.306 A:middle
then go for it.

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.316 A:middle
I think that makes a ton of
