00:11:58.316 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
Because in either scenario, with

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:02.026 A:middle
the direct to notification

00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:04.086 A:middle
center route or this one we want

00:12:04.086 --> 00:12:05.666 A:middle
you to have the best opportunity

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.086 A:middle
to deliver your notifications.

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:09.766 A:middle
So, that's what's new when

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.916 A:middle
asking for permission to send

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:11.686 A:middle
out notifications.

00:12:12.026 --> 00:12:13.046 A:middle
Remember, it's up to you.

00:12:13.486 --> 00:12:14.976 A:middle
Both approaches are valuable and

00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:16.086 A:middle
both should be considered.

00:12:16.446 --> 00:12:17.296 A:middle
It's a decision that you're

00:12:17.296 --> 00:12:19.026 A:middle
going to need based on your app

00:12:19.526 --> 00:12:20.856 A:middle
and your app's particular

00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:21.316 A:middle
content.

00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:24.586 A:middle
So, now that you've taken all

00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.136 A:middle
the right steps to make sure

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
people will be receiving your

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:28.016 A:middle
notifications.

00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:29.476 A:middle
Let's talk about how to make

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:30.536 A:middle
sure you're setting the best

00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:32.456 A:middle
content in making notifications

00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:34.476 A:middle
like extremely valuable for

00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:34.926 A:middle
everyone.

00:12:36.216 --> 00:12:37.636 A:middle
And why is it so important that

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:38.446 A:middle
we're sending out great

00:12:38.446 --> 00:12:39.246 A:middle
notifications?

00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:41.436 A:middle
It's because our attention is

00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:42.066 A:middle
valuable.

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:45.156 A:middle
Our attention is precious.

00:12:45.616 --> 00:12:47.036 A:middle
Right? Interrupting people, it's

00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:48.146 A:middle
a real privilege.

00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:49.836 A:middle
And we need to respect that.

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.456 A:middle
I mean you've all felt this

00:12:51.456 --> 00:12:51.716 A:middle
right?

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:52.986 A:middle
You're trying to focus on

00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:54.716 A:middle
something, you're in the zone.

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:56.006 A:middle
I mean maybe it's happened this

00:12:56.006 --> 00:12:56.996 A:middle
week, you're updating all your

00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.116 A:middle
apps to adopt these great new

00:12:58.116 --> 00:12:59.456 A:middle
APIs and then all the sudden

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:01.036 A:middle
[ding].
