00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:00.246 A:middle
they're receiving your different

00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:00.886 A:middle
notifications.

00:17:01.806 --> 00:17:02.966 A:middle
And if you notice at the bottom

00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:04.826 A:middle
here, we've also added a link to

00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:06.425 A:middle
your third-party custom

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:07.366 A:middle
notification settings.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:10.366 A:middle
And providing that link is even

00:17:10.366 --> 00:17:12.086 A:middle
more important now because of

00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:13.205 A:middle
our new tuning UI.

00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:14.846 A:middle
Because if someone decides to

00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:17.146 A:middle
tap turn off, we don't just

00:17:17.146 --> 00:17:18.496 A:middle
immediately stop all the

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.886 A:middle
notifications from that app, but

00:17:19.886 --> 00:17:21.356 A:middle
we present a confirmation step.

00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:23.356 A:middle
So, in this action sheet, you

00:17:23.356 --> 00:17:24.736 A:middle
could choose to turn off all

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.596 A:middle
notifications from the

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:28.106 A:middle
particular app, or tap a button,

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.316 A:middle
to go into that app's particular

00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:31.726 A:middle
custom notification settings.

00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:33.376 A:middle
And again, we want people to be

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:34.856 A:middle
in control of the types of

00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:36.116 A:middle
content that they receive.

00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:37.816 A:middle
So, while we hope that turn off

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:39.196 A:middle
everything button is a last

00:17:39.196 --> 00:17:40.926 A:middle
resort, we want to encourage

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:42.376 A:middle
people to get into your app

00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:44.276 A:middle
settings and customize the

00:17:44.276 --> 00:17:45.936 A:middle
notification categories you have

00:17:45.936 --> 00:17:47.016 A:middle
in a more granular way.

00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:49.176 A:middle
So, with this extra visibility

00:17:49.306 --> 00:17:51.076 A:middle
you know it's really important

00:17:51.076 --> 00:17:51.976 A:middle
to make sure these settings

00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:52.966 A:middle
pages are well-designed.

00:17:53.626 --> 00:17:54.296 A:middle
So, let's look at a few

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:54.686 A:middle
examples.

00:17:55.966 --> 00:17:58.066 A:middle
ESPN is an app with really

00:17:58.066 --> 00:17:58.836 A:middle
detailed settings.

00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:00.246 A:middle
And they've done a great job
