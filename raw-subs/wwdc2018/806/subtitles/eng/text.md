[So, this year in iOS 12, we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=48) [introduced a lot of great](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=51) [feature to really enhance the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=52) [notification experience, both](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=54) [for you and everyone that uses](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=56) [your apps.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=57) [And we think these features are](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=58) [really powerful, and could](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=59) [really powerful, and could](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=59) [create a meaningful, but also](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=61) [mindful experience for everyone.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=63) [But, before we get into what's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=67) [new, I think it would be helpful](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=68) [to take a trip down memory lane](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=70) [and see how the notification](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=72) [experience has evolved over the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=73) [years, because knowing how we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=74) [got here will help us make a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=76) [better future.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=78) [So, when iPhone launched, every](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=79) [alert was a blue box, model](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=81) [alert.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=83) [Do you guys remember this?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=83) [Every notification, every](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=85) [message, every invitation, it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=86) [was an interruption that needed](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=88) [to be dealt with immediately.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=90) [Nothing would be on the lock](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=92) [screen, so at times, it was](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=93) [pretty cumbersome when you'd](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=95) [unlock the phone, right?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=96) [Whatever missed messages you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=97) [received were backed up and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=98) [would appear a single box at a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=100) [time.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=101) [So, you could either ignore](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=102) [them, one at a time, or if you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=103) [wanted to reply, you launched](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=105) [into the app to take action.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=107) [Then, in iOS 4, as more apps](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=109) [were sending push notifications,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=112) [we started to queue them up on](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=113) [your lock screen.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=114) [So, now people could see all

[glance and choose the specific](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=118) [glance and choose the specific](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=118) [one they wanted to interact](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=120) [with.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=121) [A swipe on that row would launch](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=122) [into the app but all the other](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=123) [ones would be dismissed from the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=125) [lock screen.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=126) [And they all went up to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=128) [notification center.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=129) [And that was a way to access all](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=130) [the other things you had missed.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=131) [So, because so many](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=133) [notifications were being](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=134) [accumulated, this became a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=135) [really useful place to go and to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=137) [see all the other activity

of notifications](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=145) [was increasing, we wanted to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=147) [increase their quality.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=149) [Rich notifications are a great](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=151) [way to provide more context

[line.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=164) [You don't need to launch into](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=165)

doing.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=167) [And that leads us to where we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=168) [are today and all the work that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=170) [we've done to enhance

[12.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=174) [So, we're going to talk about](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=176)

we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=189) [take a moment and be candid?](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=192) [Can we talk about the current](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=194) [state of

right.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=203) [And we have way more apps than](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=204) [ever before.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/806/?time=206) [And they're sending
