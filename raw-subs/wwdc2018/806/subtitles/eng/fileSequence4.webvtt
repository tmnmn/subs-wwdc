00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.736 A:middle
new sneakers or something, that

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
could be super fun and really

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
useful.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.576 A:middle
But not all of these things all

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:05.136 A:middle
of the time.

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.446 A:middle
Again, all things in moderation.

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:09.836 A:middle
So, as more apps are continuing

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.576 A:middle
to send more notifications and

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.626 A:middle
taking more of our attention, we

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:14.496 A:middle
really have to make sure we're

00:04:14.496 --> 00:04:16.676 A:middle
doing the right thing.

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:17.736 A:middle
We need to remember that the

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:18.935 A:middle
best notifications are for

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:20.716 A:middle
connecting people and delivering

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.156 A:middle
meaningful information.

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:24.086 A:middle
Now, I know none of you here

00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:25.536 A:middle
would ever do any of this, but

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.146 A:middle
there are some app developers

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:28.466 A:middle
that maybe go a little bit

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:29.076 A:middle
overboard.

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.706 A:middle
And this year, we've created a

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:32.096 A:middle
UI that makes it easier for

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:33.006 A:middle
people to control how their

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.336 A:middle
notifications are delivered.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.516 A:middle
And there's even an option to

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:38.436 A:middle
turn off all the notifications

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.326 A:middle
from an unhelpful app.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.766 A:middle
So, in iOS 12, when you receive

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:43.756 A:middle
a notification on the lock

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:46.486 A:middle
screen, you could swipe left and

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.146 A:middle
access some actions, and you'll

00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:49.336 A:middle
notice this year, we've added a

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.066 A:middle
manage button.

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:52.726 A:middle
Tapping that brings in our newly

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.946 A:middle
designed quick tuning UI, which

00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:56.366 A:middle
allows you to configure how the

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:57.996 A:middle
notifications from that app are

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:58.686 A:middle
being delivered.

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:02.266 A:middle
So, at the top, the first option
