00:31:58.056 --> 00:32:00.316 A:middle
I just have to rotate the

00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:02.626 A:middle
digital crown, tap the stars,

00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:04.896 A:middle
hit pay, and I'm done.

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.646 A:middle
So, this is a great example of

00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:08.406 A:middle
an interface that clearly

00:32:08.406 --> 00:32:09.906 A:middle
communicates the purpose of that

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:11.506 A:middle
notification, which is to

00:32:11.506 --> 00:32:13.426 A:middle
encourage me to submit a rating

00:32:13.426 --> 00:32:14.156 A:middle
after my ride.

00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:18.576 A:middle
Pay By Phone is an app that

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:19.556 A:middle
allows you to pay for your

00:32:19.556 --> 00:32:20.566 A:middle
parking spot remotely.

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:22.196 A:middle
It's really convenient when I'm

00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:23.686 A:middle
still really far from my car and

00:32:23.686 --> 00:32:24.846 A:middle
I need to extend my time.

00:32:25.596 --> 00:32:26.816 A:middle
Here's a notification from them,

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:28.076 A:middle
letting me know that I only have

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.326 A:middle
10 minutes left on my parking

00:32:29.326 --> 00:32:29.666 A:middle
spot.

00:32:30.146 --> 00:32:31.636 A:middle
It allows me to extend my time

00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:32.696 A:middle
right in the long look.

00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:35.526 A:middle
I just have to rotate the

00:32:35.526 --> 00:32:36.966 A:middle
digital crown, and I tap

00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:38.906 A:middle
steppers, and that's all I have

00:32:38.906 --> 00:32:41.256 A:middle
to do to extend my time.

00:32:41.736 --> 00:32:43.206 A:middle
So, this is a great example of a

00:32:43.206 --> 00:32:43.986 A:middle
quick interaction.

00:32:43.986 --> 00:32:45.676 A:middle
I was able to extend my parking

00:32:45.676 --> 00:32:51.086 A:middle
time with just a couple of taps.

00:32:51.246 --> 00:32:52.856 A:middle
So, amongst my friends, I'm

00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:53.966 A:middle
oftentimes the person that

00:32:53.966 --> 00:32:55.146 A:middle
chooses the restaurant and makes

00:32:55.196 --> 00:32:56.126 A:middle
dinner reservations.

00:32:56.536 --> 00:32:57.796 A:middle
And because of traffic and

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:58.936 A:middle
weather, you name it, people are

00:32:58.936 --> 00:32:59.856 A:middle
always running late.
