00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:00.176 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:01.676 A:middle
And it's an important moment.

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:03.236 A:middle
And you should remember that

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:04.276 A:middle
you're asking someone to make

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:05.626 A:middle
the difficult decision here.

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:07.076 A:middle
I mean put yourself in their

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:07.746 A:middle
shoes right.

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:08.926 A:middle
They just downloaded your app.

00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:10.316 A:middle
They're excited to give it a run

00:07:10.316 --> 00:07:11.186 A:middle
for the first time.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:11.896 A:middle
And then all of the sudden,

00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:12.446 A:middle
they're interrupted.

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:14.096 A:middle
And then they're asked make this

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:15.476 A:middle
decision about receiving

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.246 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:18.256 A:middle
How are they supposed to know,

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:18.526 A:middle
right?

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:20.016 A:middle
Especially if it's presented

00:07:20.016 --> 00:07:21.656 A:middle
without any context and you're

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:22.656 A:middle
not letting them know why

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.996 A:middle
notifications are valuable, and

00:07:24.996 --> 00:07:26.416 A:middle
if they've really had any time

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.676 A:middle
to experience your app.

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:28.856 A:middle
I mean why should they tap

00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:29.286 A:middle
allow?

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.136 A:middle
So, this happens, right?

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:31.946 A:middle
They don't.

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:33.386 A:middle
And that was it.

00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:35.586 A:middle
You had one shot, one

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.026 A:middle
opportunity to send

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:37.676 A:middle
notifications.

00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:39.206 A:middle
And that was your only way to

00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:39.996 A:middle
ask for permission.

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:42.416 A:middle
Well, in iOS 12, that's no

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:43.116 A:middle
longer the case.

00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:45.456 A:middle
We've created a new feature that

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:46.886 A:middle
allows you to send notifications

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.616 A:middle
directly and only into

00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:50.236 A:middle
notification center, without

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.506 A:middle
running that initial prompt.

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:52.596 A:middle
It's your choice.

00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:54.186 A:middle
You can continue to show the

00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:55.866 A:middle
prompt and ask for the privilege

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:56.916 A:middle
to send notifications to the

00:07:56.916 --> 00:07:59.236 A:middle
lock screen with the risk of

00:07:59.236 --> 00:07:59.886 A:middle
being denied.
