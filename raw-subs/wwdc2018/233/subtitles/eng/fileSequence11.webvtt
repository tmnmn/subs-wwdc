00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:00.186 A:middle
in layout.

00:11:00.836 --> 00:11:02.606 A:middle
Let's look at a simple sample

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:03.996 A:middle
app that we wrote to highlight

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:04.366 A:middle
this.

00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:06.066 A:middle
Ben, can you take us through

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:06.456 A:middle
this app?

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:07.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Sure, Peter.

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:10.226 A:middle
So, there's a really simple

00:11:10.226 --> 00:11:11.776 A:middle
sample app, with this cool guy

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:12.206 A:middle
in the middle.

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:14.046 A:middle
He shows when we're feeling

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:14.356 A:middle
cool.

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.496 A:middle
When we're not, he hides away.

00:11:17.806 --> 00:11:18.976 A:middle
But, we're feeling quite cool

00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:19.616 A:middle
right now, Peter.

00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:20.666 A:middle
So, let's bring him back in.

00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:23.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. So, while this is a

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:25.666 A:middle
simple example, it's really

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:27.006 A:middle
important to walk through, so we

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:28.636 A:middle
can understand how layout-driven

00:11:28.636 --> 00:11:29.476 A:middle
UI works.

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.996 A:middle
So, let's go through a skeleton

00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:34.146 A:middle
of this app, and follow through

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.256 A:middle
the layout-driven UI recipe that

00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:37.306 A:middle
Ben showed us earlier.

00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:40.016 A:middle
So, here we've got our managing

00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:42.046 A:middle
view that hosts this cool guy

00:11:42.046 --> 00:11:43.846 A:middle
view, in our coolView, which I

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:45.056 A:middle
wrote ahead of time.

00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:47.296 A:middle
So, Ben, what's the first step

00:11:47.296 --> 00:11:47.966 A:middle
in our recipe?

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:50.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, we need to identify and

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.386 A:middle
track that state that affects

00:11:52.386 --> 00:11:52.766 A:middle
our UI.

00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:55.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, remember what Ben said.

00:11:55.456 --> 00:11:56.856 A:middle
The cool guy is there when we're

00:11:56.986 --> 00:11:57.986 A:middle
feeling cool.

00:11:57.986 --> 00:11:59.656 A:middle
And, he's not there when we're

00:11:59.656 --> 00:11:59.936 A:middle
not.
