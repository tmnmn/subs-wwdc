update your UI and handle user

00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:00.946 A:middle
input.

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:04.136 A:middle
Ben, what kind of work can we

00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:05.156 A:middle
push off the main queue?

00:30:06.186 --> 00:30:06.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, there's some usual

00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:08.086 A:middle
stuff that you might expect,

00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:10.696 A:middle
like network and file system

00:30:10.696 --> 00:30:11.216 A:middle
access.

00:30:11.566 --> 00:30:12.606 A:middle
These should never be running on

00:30:12.606 --> 00:30:13.156 A:middle
the main thread.

00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:15.116 A:middle
But, maybe some other stuff that

00:30:15.116 --> 00:30:16.836 A:middle
you might not expect, like image

00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:17.866 A:middle
drawing and text sizing.

00:30:18.996 --> 00:30:20.916 A:middle
UIGraphicsImageRenderer, and its

00:30:20.916 --> 00:30:22.826 A:middle
distributed string, both have

00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:24.456 A:middle
functions available that are

00:30:24.456 --> 00:30:25.606 A:middle
safe to use on a background

00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:27.216 A:middle
thread, that might just help you

00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:29.546 A:middle
move some of that complex

00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:31.236 A:middle
computation off of your main

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:31.506 A:middle
queue.

00:30:32.776 --> 00:30:34.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow, Ben, those are great

00:30:34.406 --> 00:30:34.756 A:middle
tips.

00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:35.946 A:middle
I never would have thought to do

00:30:35.946 --> 00:30:37.376 A:middle
that off of the main queue.

00:30:38.246 --> 00:30:40.396 A:middle
So, let's say I've run the Time

00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:40.996 A:middle
Profiler.

00:30:41.316 --> 00:30:42.896 A:middle
I've used prefetching, just like

00:30:42.896 --> 00:30:44.046 A:middle
those guys told me to.

00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:45.466 A:middle
And, I've pushed as much work as

00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:46.836 A:middle
possible off of the main queue,

00:30:47.816 --> 00:30:49.296 A:middle
but my app is still slow.

00:30:50.016 --> 00:30:51.516 A:middle
Surely this isn't my problem,

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:51.986 A:middle
right Ben?

00:30:53.056 --> 00:30:54.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, Peter, we may not be

00:30:54.226 --> 00:30:55.576 A:middle
out of the woods just yet.

00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:57.976 A:middle
While we may have optimized our

00:30:57.976 --> 00:31:00.276 A:middle
computation, we could still be
