00:46:59.026 --> 00:47:00.566 A:middle
And, right now one of our labels

00:47:00.566 --> 00:47:01.046 A:middle
is missing.

00:47:02.276 --> 00:47:03.286 A:middle
So, we're going to run dump on

00:47:03.286 --> 00:47:05.636 A:middle
our parent view, and take a look

00:47:05.636 --> 00:47:06.396 A:middle
at what's going on here.

00:47:07.906 --> 00:47:08.796 A:middle
So, we've found our missing

00:47:08.796 --> 00:47:09.246 A:middle
label.

00:47:09.246 --> 00:47:12.046 A:middle
It is here, but it's -- if we

00:47:12.046 --> 00:47:13.076 A:middle
bring up and look at the

00:47:13.116 --> 00:47:14.906 A:middle
imageView that's alongside it,

00:47:15.756 --> 00:47:18.236 A:middle
we notice that the frame of

00:47:18.236 --> 00:47:19.896 A:middle
these two things, they both have

00:47:19.896 --> 00:47:20.926 A:middle
the same origin.

00:47:22.126 --> 00:47:22.916 A:middle
So, what's likely happening

00:47:22.916 --> 00:47:24.366 A:middle
here, is that the label is

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:26.226 A:middle
obstructed by the imageView.

00:47:27.296 --> 00:47:28.086 A:middle
So, we need to go and look at

00:47:28.086 --> 00:47:29.826 A:middle
our layout code again, I think.

00:47:30.576 --> 00:47:34.136 A:middle
In addition to dump for Swift

00:47:34.136 --> 00:47:36.406 A:middle
objects, if you still have some

00:47:36.406 --> 00:47:37.816 A:middle
Objective-C code lying around,

00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:40.306 A:middle
NSObject also has the

00:47:40.366 --> 00:47:41.546 A:middle
ivarDescription method.

00:47:42.856 --> 00:47:44.146 A:middle
This will print all of the

00:47:44.146 --> 00:47:45.676 A:middle
instance variables of your

00:47:45.676 --> 00:47:46.806 A:middle
Objective-C objects.

00:47:48.546 --> 00:47:49.986 A:middle
We have another bug in our

00:47:49.986 --> 00:47:51.716 A:middle
screenshot's code, where our

00:47:51.716 --> 00:47:53.176 A:middle
crop handles aren't working for

00:47:53.176 --> 00:47:53.626 A:middle
some reason.

00:47:54.116 --> 00:47:57.786 A:middle
If we call ivarDescription on

00:47:57.786 --> 00:47:59.926 A:middle
our screenshot's view, we can

00:47:59.926 --> 00:48:02.826 A:middle
see by looking closely, that our
