00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:01.526 A:middle
So, I guess we'll have a

00:12:01.526 --> 00:12:03.256 A:middle
variable called feelingCool.

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:06.206 A:middle
OK. Ben, what's the second step

00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:06.846 A:middle
in the recipe?

00:12:07.536 --> 00:12:08.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, now, every time this

00:12:08.906 --> 00:12:10.626 A:middle
state changes, we need to dirty

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:12.066 A:middle
the layout system by calling

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:12.876 A:middle
setNeedsLayout.

00:12:13.696 --> 00:12:15.336 A:middle
But, we need to make sure that

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:16.586 A:middle
every time this state changes

00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:17.196 A:middle
this happens.

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:18.646 A:middle
And, this state could change

00:12:19.256 --> 00:12:20.426 A:middle
from various places in our

00:12:20.426 --> 00:12:21.076 A:middle
application.

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.016 A:middle
So, Peter, how can we ensure

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:24.196 A:middle
that we're always dirtying the

00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:25.066 A:middle
layout system when there's

00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:25.446 A:middle
changes?

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:27.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm happy you asked, because

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:28.386 A:middle
I think I've got a good idea for

00:12:28.386 --> 00:12:28.756 A:middle
this.

00:12:29.356 --> 00:12:30.506 A:middle
We can use a feature called

00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:32.456 A:middle
Swift property observers.

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:35.526 A:middle
These let us run code before or

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.106 A:middle
after a property is set.

00:12:37.106 --> 00:12:39.366 A:middle
So, we can use the didSet

00:12:39.396 --> 00:12:41.146 A:middle
property observer to call

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:42.046 A:middle
setNeedsLayout.

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:44.286 A:middle
This is a really excellent use

00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:45.776 A:middle
of Swift property observers in

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:47.276 A:middle
your app.

00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:49.076 A:middle
OK. So, we're almost done.

00:12:49.496 --> 00:12:50.766 A:middle
Ben, what's the last step in the

00:12:50.766 --> 00:12:51.286 A:middle
recipe?

00:12:51.766 --> 00:12:53.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well now, Peter, using this

00:12:53.056 --> 00:12:54.986 A:middle
state, we need to update our UI

00:12:55.226 --> 00:12:56.236 A:middle
in layoutSubviews.

00:12:57.396 --> 00:12:58.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; OK, easy.

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:00.876 A:middle
We'll override layoutSubviews,
