00:49:00.296 --> 00:49:00.386 A:middle
app.

00:49:01.296 --> 00:49:02.846 A:middle
But, sometimes we don't have an

00:49:02.846 --> 00:49:03.736 A:middle
issue with views or

00:49:03.736 --> 00:49:04.706 A:middle
viewControllers.

00:49:05.316 --> 00:49:06.656 A:middle
We don't have an issue with

00:49:06.656 --> 00:49:09.126 A:middle
state, instead we have a really

00:49:09.126 --> 00:49:11.036 A:middle
hairy memory management issue.

00:49:12.246 --> 00:49:13.626 A:middle
Ben, are there any tools we can

00:49:13.626 --> 00:49:14.316 A:middle
use for this?

00:49:15.416 --> 00:49:16.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad you asked

00:49:16.196 --> 00:49:17.826 A:middle
Peter, because yes, there is

00:49:17.826 --> 00:49:19.456 A:middle
another great tool built into

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:19.886 A:middle
Xcode.

00:49:20.486 --> 00:49:21.746 A:middle
The Xcode memory debugger.

00:49:22.346 --> 00:49:24.776 A:middle
This tool will help you

00:49:24.776 --> 00:49:26.396 A:middle
visualize exactly how your

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:27.806 A:middle
application is using memory.

00:49:29.296 --> 00:49:30.796 A:middle
Peter and I were debugging an

00:49:30.796 --> 00:49:31.666 A:middle
issue the other day, where we

00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:32.916 A:middle
had a leaking viewController.

00:49:33.816 --> 00:49:35.046 A:middle
And, we could see that here that

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:36.516 A:middle
it's being held onto by a block.

00:49:37.846 --> 00:49:39.106 A:middle
By enabling Malloc stack

00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:40.616 A:middle
logging, we were able to see the

00:49:40.616 --> 00:49:42.966 A:middle
full backtrace of exactly when

00:49:42.966 --> 00:49:44.066 A:middle
this block was allocated.

00:49:44.626 --> 00:49:47.486 A:middle
By zooming in, we can see that

00:49:47.486 --> 00:49:49.026 A:middle
this block was actually created

00:49:49.266 --> 00:49:50.356 A:middle
by that viewController.

00:49:51.406 --> 00:49:52.666 A:middle
And so, that block is holding

00:49:52.666 --> 00:49:53.696 A:middle
onto that viewController.

00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:55.246 A:middle
But that viewController is also

00:49:55.246 --> 00:49:56.076 A:middle
holding onto the block.

00:49:57.236 --> 00:49:58.316 A:middle
And, there's our retain cycle.

00:49:59.616 --> 00:49:59.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow.
