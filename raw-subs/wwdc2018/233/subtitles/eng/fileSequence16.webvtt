00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.516 A:middle
we didn't add any special case

00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:01.506 A:middle
for these animations.

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:03.296 A:middle
We just kind of got this

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.516 A:middle
animated layout for free by

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:07.466 A:middle
doing our layout inside of an

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:08.326 A:middle
animation block.

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:10.756 A:middle
This is really, really awesome.

00:16:11.526 --> 00:16:12.946 A:middle
So, that's how we can add

00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:14.356 A:middle
animations to our layout-driven

00:16:14.356 --> 00:16:15.426 A:middle
UI app.

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:17.856 A:middle
Finally, let's take about the

00:16:18.006 --> 00:16:20.136 A:middle
third core aspect of an iOS app,

00:16:20.306 --> 00:16:21.536 A:middle
and that's gestures.

00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:24.026 A:middle
And, of course, we can't talk

00:16:24.026 --> 00:16:25.516 A:middle
about gestures without talking

00:16:25.516 --> 00:16:27.386 A:middle
about UIGestureRecognizer,

00:16:27.876 --> 00:16:29.916 A:middle
UIKit's awesome API for adding

00:16:29.916 --> 00:16:31.386 A:middle
gestural interactions to your

00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:33.346 A:middle
app.

00:16:33.616 --> 00:16:35.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; UIKit provides a number of

00:16:35.226 --> 00:16:36.976 A:middle
great concrete subclasses of

00:16:36.976 --> 00:16:38.086 A:middle
UIgestureRecognizer.

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:40.646 A:middle
Everything from pans to pinches

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:41.876 A:middle
to swipes to rotation.

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:43.496 A:middle
You should be able to create the

00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:44.686 A:middle
kind of interactions you want,

00:16:44.686 --> 00:16:45.346 A:middle
using these.

00:16:45.856 --> 00:16:47.266 A:middle
And, they're highly customizable

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:47.656 A:middle
as well.

00:16:49.026 --> 00:16:50.366 A:middle
If you want something really

00:16:50.506 --> 00:16:52.366 A:middle
crazy, you can always subclass

00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:53.696 A:middle
UIGestureRecognizer yourself as

00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:53.936 A:middle
well.

00:16:55.876 --> 00:16:57.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; When looking between the

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:57.746 A:middle
built-in

00:16:57.746 --> 00:17:00.206 A:middle
UIKitGestureRecognizers, it's
