00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:01.106 A:middle
your view, even if it's

00:15:01.106 --> 00:15:02.946 A:middle
mid-animation, when doing

00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:03.576 A:middle
animation.

00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:06.116 A:middle
And so, this lets us do these

00:15:06.116 --> 00:15:07.926 A:middle
really wonderful, interruptible

00:15:07.926 --> 00:15:09.156 A:middle
interactive animations.

00:15:09.906 --> 00:15:11.636 A:middle
Let's look at an example in our

00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:13.266 A:middle
macOS The Gathering trading card

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:15.166 A:middle
game app.

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.036 A:middle
So, here we've got a variable

00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:18.846 A:middle
that tracks what cards are in

00:15:18.846 --> 00:15:19.406 A:middle
our deck.

00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:21.386 A:middle
And, using those Swift property

00:15:21.386 --> 00:15:22.406 A:middle
observers we talked about

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:24.236 A:middle
earlier, we're dirtying the

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:25.666 A:middle
layout system every time this

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:27.066 A:middle
changes by calling

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:27.896 A:middle
setNeedsLayout.

00:15:28.346 --> 00:15:32.326 A:middle
Next, when we want to put a card

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:34.106 A:middle
in the deck, all we have to do

00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:36.346 A:middle
is add that card to this array,

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:38.746 A:middle
which will dirty our layout, and

00:15:38.746 --> 00:15:40.546 A:middle
then inside of an animation

00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:41.546 A:middle
block, using this

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:43.746 A:middle
beginFromCurrentState option, we

00:15:43.746 --> 00:15:45.276 A:middle
call layoutIfNeeded.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.816 A:middle
This will trigger a call to our

00:15:47.816 --> 00:15:49.576 A:middle
code in layoutSubviews, which

00:15:49.576 --> 00:15:50.746 A:middle
will move all of our views

00:15:50.746 --> 00:15:52.606 A:middle
around, play the appropriate

00:15:52.606 --> 00:15:54.056 A:middle
animation state transitions.

00:15:54.316 --> 00:15:55.836 A:middle
And, what's really excellent

00:15:55.836 --> 00:15:57.056 A:middle
about this, that I really want

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.746 A:middle
to highlight here, is notice how

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.516 A:middle
we didn't add any special case
