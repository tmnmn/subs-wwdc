00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:01.796 A:middle
in your app.

00:43:01.956 --> 00:43:03.966 A:middle
Again, they're also great things

00:43:03.966 --> 00:43:05.326 A:middle
to not include when you submit

00:43:05.326 --> 00:43:06.006 A:middle
to the App Store.

00:43:07.436 --> 00:43:08.716 A:middle
It's important to note that

00:43:08.716 --> 00:43:10.646 A:middle
these are Objective-C selectors.

00:43:11.146 --> 00:43:12.466 A:middle
So, before using them, you'll

00:43:12.466 --> 00:43:14.316 A:middle
want to put your debugger into

00:43:14.316 --> 00:43:16.706 A:middle
Objective-C mode, using this

00:43:16.706 --> 00:43:17.166 A:middle
command.

00:43:18.276 --> 00:43:19.826 A:middle
We're going to walk through each

00:43:19.826 --> 00:43:20.996 A:middle
of these debugging methods,

00:43:21.146 --> 00:43:22.976 A:middle
step-by-step, and how they can

00:43:22.976 --> 00:43:25.366 A:middle
help you, starting with UIView

00:43:25.526 --> 00:43:27.196 A:middle
recursiveDescription.

00:43:28.616 --> 00:43:29.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, UIView

00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:31.796 A:middle
recursiveDescription will print

00:43:31.826 --> 00:43:34.136 A:middle
the view hierarchy of the

00:43:34.136 --> 00:43:35.156 A:middle
receiver -- the subview

00:43:35.156 --> 00:43:35.606 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:43:36.096 --> 00:43:37.996 A:middle
And, some associated properties

00:43:38.196 --> 00:43:39.256 A:middle
to help you understand the

00:43:39.256 --> 00:43:40.216 A:middle
layout attributes.

00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:42.896 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:43:43.696 --> 00:43:44.536 A:middle
We have another bug in our

00:43:44.536 --> 00:43:46.086 A:middle
screenshots UI with a missing

00:43:46.086 --> 00:43:46.386 A:middle
view.

00:43:47.686 --> 00:43:48.276 A:middle
So, we're going to call

00:43:48.276 --> 00:43:49.926 A:middle
recursiveDescription on our

00:43:49.926 --> 00:43:51.516 A:middle
viewController's view.

00:43:52.086 --> 00:43:55.086 A:middle
Now, this might look like a wall

00:43:55.086 --> 00:43:56.346 A:middle
of debug text, and that's

00:43:56.346 --> 00:43:57.166 A:middle
because it is.

00:43:57.626 --> 00:43:59.916 A:middle
But, we know what we're looking

00:43:59.916 --> 00:44:00.196 A:middle
for.
