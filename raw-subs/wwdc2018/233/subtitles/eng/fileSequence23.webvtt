00:22:58.386 --> 00:23:00.166 A:middle
So, you should really limit your

00:23:00.166 --> 00:23:01.226 A:middle
use of these third-party

00:23:01.226 --> 00:23:02.906 A:middle
libraries as much as possible.

00:23:04.006 --> 00:23:05.546 A:middle
And, finally, you're going to

00:23:05.546 --> 00:23:06.926 A:middle
want to avoid static

00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:09.586 A:middle
initializers, and having any

00:23:09.586 --> 00:23:11.076 A:middle
behavior in methods like plus

00:23:11.076 --> 00:23:12.966 A:middle
initialize, and plus load.

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:15.116 A:middle
Because these have to run before

00:23:15.116 --> 00:23:16.706 A:middle
your app can do any meaningful

00:23:16.706 --> 00:23:17.026 A:middle
work.

00:23:18.556 --> 00:23:19.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; To learn more about this

00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:21.366 A:middle
vital part of your launch time,

00:23:21.856 --> 00:23:23.316 A:middle
check out App Start-up Time:

00:23:23.366 --> 00:23:25.116 A:middle
Past, Present, and Future from

00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:27.376 A:middle
WWDC 2017.

00:23:28.436 --> 00:23:30.786 A:middle
The next phase of your launch is

00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:31.976 A:middle
your UI Construction.

00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:34.796 A:middle
At this point, you're preparing

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.366 A:middle
your UI, building up your

00:23:36.366 --> 00:23:37.076 A:middle
viewControllers.

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:40.136 A:middle
The system is doing state

00:23:40.136 --> 00:23:41.596 A:middle
restoration, and loading in your

00:23:41.596 --> 00:23:42.256 A:middle
preferences.

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:45.026 A:middle
And, you're loading in the data

00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:46.746 A:middle
that you need for your app to

00:23:46.746 --> 00:23:47.626 A:middle
become responsive.

00:23:48.186 --> 00:23:50.996 A:middle
So, Peter, what can we do at

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.026 A:middle
this phase of the launch to

00:23:52.026 --> 00:23:52.536 A:middle
optimize?

00:23:53.636 --> 00:23:54.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You'll want to optimize the

00:23:54.896 --> 00:23:56.686 A:middle
UI construction phase to be as

00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.276 A:middle
fast as possible for your app.

00:23:59.376 --> 00:24:01.226 A:middle
This means returning as quickly
