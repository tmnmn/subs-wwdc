00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:01.476 A:middle
The next thing you're going to

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:03.386 A:middle
want to think about is changing

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:04.686 A:middle
your app's default behavior for

00:07:05.186 --> 00:07:06.616 A:middle
when it has an external display

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:07.106 A:middle
connected.

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:10.276 A:middle
Let's look at an example of some

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:12.266 A:middle
code from our demo app.

00:07:13.256 --> 00:07:14.466 A:middle
This is the code that's called

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:16.216 A:middle
when we tap on a photo in your

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:16.806 A:middle
collection view.

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.436 A:middle
When we're in single display

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:21.236 A:middle
mode, we create our

00:07:21.236 --> 00:07:23.186 A:middle
photoViewController and push it

00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:24.396 A:middle
onto our navigation stack.

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:26.766 A:middle
But, when we have an external

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:28.596 A:middle
display connected, we're already

00:07:28.596 --> 00:07:29.966 A:middle
showing that photoViewController

00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:31.886 A:middle
full screen in that second UI,

00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:34.466 A:middle
so we just tell it to present

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:35.066 A:middle
that photo.

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.046 A:middle
Really easy.

00:07:37.836 --> 00:07:39.356 A:middle
The third thing you should think

00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:40.976 A:middle
about when designing for an

00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:43.616 A:middle
external display is you should

00:07:43.616 --> 00:07:45.476 A:middle
handle connection changes with

00:07:45.476 --> 00:07:46.556 A:middle
graceful transitions.

00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:50.366 A:middle
Let's go back to our demo app to

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:51.006 A:middle
illustrate this.

00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:54.776 A:middle
Here you can see our demo app is

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:56.056 A:middle
currently showing a photo full

00:07:56.056 --> 00:07:56.446 A:middle
size.

00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:58.436 A:middle
And, we haven't yet connected

00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.496 A:middle
the external display yet.
