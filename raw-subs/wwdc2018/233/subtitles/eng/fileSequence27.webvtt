00:27:01.676 --> 00:27:03.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Coffee is for quick apps.

00:27:04.466 --> 00:27:05.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It's essential that you

00:27:05.516 --> 00:27:07.316 A:middle
understand where your launch

00:27:07.316 --> 00:27:07.966 A:middle
time is going.

00:27:08.636 --> 00:27:10.156 A:middle
So, measure it regularly using

00:27:10.156 --> 00:27:11.076 A:middle
the Time Profiler.

00:27:12.126 --> 00:27:13.326 A:middle
Any time you change code in the

00:27:13.326 --> 00:27:14.566 A:middle
path -- in your launch path,

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.636 A:middle
you'll want to remeasure.

00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:18.936 A:middle
And, take statistical averages.

00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:20.856 A:middle
Don't depend on a single profile

00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:23.896 A:middle
to check your launch time.

00:27:24.086 --> 00:27:25.536 A:middle
So, laser-fast launches.

00:27:26.076 --> 00:27:27.406 A:middle
Get responsive fast.

00:27:27.706 --> 00:27:28.976 A:middle
Use only what you need.

00:27:29.476 --> 00:27:31.226 A:middle
And, measure, measure, measure.

00:27:31.506 --> 00:27:31.686 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:41.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Scrolling is a key part of

00:27:41.986 --> 00:27:44.466 A:middle
the iOS user experience, and a

00:27:44.566 --> 00:27:46.246 A:middle
huge part of the experience

00:27:46.296 --> 00:27:48.956 A:middle
inside your apps.

00:27:48.956 --> 00:27:51.086 A:middle
iPhone and iPad are magical

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:52.806 A:middle
sheets of glass that can

00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:54.916 A:middle
transform into anything your app

00:27:54.916 --> 00:27:55.806 A:middle
would like them to be.

00:27:57.096 --> 00:27:58.896 A:middle
So, it's important that you work

00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:00.536 A:middle
to help preserve this illusion
