for.

00:44:00.196 --> 00:44:02.206 A:middle
Our screenshots view is there.

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.256 A:middle
We can see it.

00:44:03.506 --> 00:44:05.606 A:middle
And, on inspection, we can see

00:44:05.606 --> 00:44:06.656 A:middle
that it is currently hidden.

00:44:07.226 --> 00:44:09.266 A:middle
So, we need to go and look at

00:44:09.266 --> 00:44:10.786 A:middle
everywhere we're setting the

00:44:10.786 --> 00:44:11.876 A:middle
hidden property on this view,

00:44:11.876 --> 00:44:13.366 A:middle
and really understand why it's

00:44:14.086 --> 00:44:15.406 A:middle
not showing.

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:16.736 A:middle
In addition to

00:44:16.736 --> 00:44:18.626 A:middle
recursiveDescription, UIView

00:44:18.626 --> 00:44:20.166 A:middle
also has parentDescription,

00:44:20.476 --> 00:44:21.666 A:middle
which will walk up the view

00:44:21.666 --> 00:44:24.046 A:middle
hierarchy to the parent views,

00:44:24.946 --> 00:44:26.486 A:middle
until it reaches no -- to a nil

00:44:26.486 --> 00:44:26.866 A:middle
parent.

00:44:27.536 --> 00:44:28.626 A:middle
It'll print the same kind of

00:44:28.626 --> 00:44:29.536 A:middle
debugging information.

00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:33.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; RecursiveDescription and

00:44:33.476 --> 00:44:35.206 A:middle
parentDescription are great for

00:44:35.206 --> 00:44:36.326 A:middle
UIView issues.

00:44:36.946 --> 00:44:38.066 A:middle
But, sometimes you have a

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:40.016 A:middle
problem with UIViewControllers.

00:44:40.246 --> 00:44:41.736 A:middle
And, for that you can use the

00:44:41.736 --> 00:44:43.026 A:middle
great class method,

00:44:43.406 --> 00:44:45.686 A:middle
UIViewController printHierarchy.

00:44:47.026 --> 00:44:48.536 A:middle
Recently we had a bug in our

00:44:48.536 --> 00:44:50.286 A:middle
screenshot editor, where one of

00:44:50.286 --> 00:44:51.676 A:middle
our viewControllers had not yet

00:44:51.676 --> 00:44:53.296 A:middle
received the viewDidAppear

00:44:53.296 --> 00:44:53.846 A:middle
message.

00:44:54.266 --> 00:44:55.366 A:middle
And so, it hadn't set up its

00:44:55.366 --> 00:44:56.256 A:middle
state appropriately.

00:44:57.316 --> 00:44:58.916 A:middle
By running UIViewController

00:44:58.986 --> 00:45:01.136 A:middle
printHierarchy, we can get an
