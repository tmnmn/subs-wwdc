00:45:58.786 --> 00:46:00.676 A:middle
Any code that you can run in the

00:46:00.676 --> 00:46:02.376 A:middle
source editor, you can write

00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:03.986 A:middle
right in the debugger, and run

00:46:04.216 --> 00:46:05.696 A:middle
while your program is running.

00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:08.446 A:middle
This is so useful for debugging.

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:10.416 A:middle
You can call functions on your

00:46:10.416 --> 00:46:12.496 A:middle
structs, get properties on your

00:46:12.496 --> 00:46:14.816 A:middle
objects, and better diagnose

00:46:14.926 --> 00:46:16.146 A:middle
what your program is doing.

00:46:17.176 --> 00:46:18.726 A:middle
For even more about debugging,

00:46:19.136 --> 00:46:20.856 A:middle
check out this great talk on how

00:46:20.856 --> 00:46:23.286 A:middle
to debug with LLDB from 2012,

00:46:23.866 --> 00:46:25.776 A:middle
and how to debug with Swift from

00:46:25.776 --> 00:46:26.826 A:middle
2014.

00:46:27.796 --> 00:46:29.376 A:middle
There's some great functions

00:46:29.376 --> 00:46:31.346 A:middle
that you can run inside of LLDB

00:46:31.346 --> 00:46:33.006 A:middle
with the expression command,

00:46:33.116 --> 00:46:34.236 A:middle
that we're going to teach you.

00:46:34.486 --> 00:46:35.976 A:middle
And, the first one, is dump.

00:46:36.516 --> 00:46:40.906 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:43.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dump will print all of your

00:46:43.446 --> 00:46:45.866 A:middle
Swift objects and structs

00:46:46.286 --> 00:46:46.816 A:middle
properties.

00:46:48.246 --> 00:46:49.656 A:middle
Let's go through another bug

00:46:50.066 --> 00:46:51.536 A:middle
that we have in some of our

00:46:51.536 --> 00:46:52.106 A:middle
custom UI.

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.076 A:middle
We have a view with a number of

00:46:55.156 --> 00:46:57.906 A:middle
subviews, including some labels,

00:46:57.906 --> 00:46:58.676 A:middle
and an imageView.

00:46:59.026 --> 00:47:00.566 A:middle
And, right now one of our labels
