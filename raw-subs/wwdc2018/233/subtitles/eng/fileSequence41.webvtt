00:40:58.716 --> 00:41:00.356 A:middle
might run into that make you

00:41:00.356 --> 00:41:01.646 A:middle
feel less than great.

00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:04.326 A:middle
So, let's start with a detective

00:41:04.326 --> 00:41:04.956 A:middle
mindset.

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.716 A:middle
When you're looking at a problem

00:41:07.716 --> 00:41:09.286 A:middle
in your program, you want to

00:41:09.286 --> 00:41:10.566 A:middle
make sure to verify your

00:41:10.566 --> 00:41:11.266 A:middle
assumptions.

00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:13.206 A:middle
What do you expect your program

00:41:13.206 --> 00:41:13.866 A:middle
to be doing?

00:41:14.006 --> 00:41:15.356 A:middle
And then, verify that it's

00:41:15.356 --> 00:41:16.336 A:middle
actually doing that.

00:41:17.086 --> 00:41:18.686 A:middle
This can be a great step, when

00:41:18.686 --> 00:41:20.056 A:middle
you start to debug issues in

00:41:20.056 --> 00:41:20.476 A:middle
your app.

00:41:21.996 --> 00:41:23.516 A:middle
Once you're pretty sure which of

00:41:23.516 --> 00:41:24.656 A:middle
your assumptions is being

00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:27.956 A:middle
violated, you can start by

00:41:27.956 --> 00:41:29.196 A:middle
looking for clues.

00:41:30.126 --> 00:41:31.316 A:middle
You'll use the tools that we'll

00:41:31.316 --> 00:41:33.196 A:middle
show you during this section to

00:41:33.196 --> 00:41:34.956 A:middle
poke and prod at your objects

00:41:34.956 --> 00:41:35.676 A:middle
and structs.

00:41:36.736 --> 00:41:38.126 A:middle
And then, you're going to want

00:41:38.126 --> 00:41:40.156 A:middle
to test your hunches, by

00:41:40.156 --> 00:41:42.176 A:middle
changing state in your app, and

00:41:42.176 --> 00:41:43.256 A:middle
verifying that you found the

00:41:43.256 --> 00:41:43.656 A:middle
issue.

00:41:44.816 --> 00:41:46.416 A:middle
Let's start with a sample bug

00:41:46.576 --> 00:41:47.666 A:middle
that's a real bug.

00:41:47.726 --> 00:41:50.406 A:middle
One of the great things that I

00:41:50.406 --> 00:41:51.596 A:middle
get the privilege of working on

00:41:51.596 --> 00:41:53.466 A:middle
here at Apple, is the screenshot

00:41:53.466 --> 00:41:53.846 A:middle
editor.

00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:56.456 A:middle
Recently, we were debugging an

00:41:56.456 --> 00:41:58.576 A:middle
issue, where my screenshot pen

00:41:58.576 --> 00:42:00.346 A:middle
tools were missing, which is
