00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:00.066 A:middle
information shown on this

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:02.126 A:middle
display is public.

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Additionally, while the

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:06.186 A:middle
displays built into iPhone and

00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:08.406 A:middle
iPad are interactive, the

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.096 A:middle
external display is not.

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:12.656 A:middle
So, you should avoid showing UI

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:14.326 A:middle
elements, or other interactable

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:15.856 A:middle
controls on the external

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:16.276 A:middle
display.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, let's apply this kind of

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:21.685 A:middle
thinking to our demo app, and

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:24.086 A:middle
see what we can come up with.

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:26.316 A:middle
Here's our optimized version for

00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:27.206 A:middle
the external display.

00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:29.636 A:middle
As you can see, we're now

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.356 A:middle
showing the selected photo full

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.326 A:middle
size on the external display.

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:36.886 A:middle
And, on the integrated display,

00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:38.206 A:middle
we're showing just the

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:39.816 A:middle
thumbnails, and a new selection

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:41.896 A:middle
indicator to show the photo that

00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:43.086 A:middle
is currently being shown full

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:43.496 A:middle
screen.

00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:46.886 A:middle
While simple, this is a really

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:49.386 A:middle
powerful use of this design.

00:04:50.616 --> 00:04:52.166 A:middle
To show you how we built this

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.736 A:middle
into our demo app, we're going

00:04:53.736 --> 00:04:54.886 A:middle
to cover three topics.

00:04:56.176 --> 00:04:58.716 A:middle
Connectivity, behavior, and

00:04:58.716 --> 00:04:59.886 A:middle
connection transitions.
