00:35:59.966 --> 00:36:00.816 A:middle
activity to your

00:36:00.816 --> 00:36:02.376 A:middle
viewController's userActivity

00:36:02.376 --> 00:36:02.876 A:middle
property.

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:05.276 A:middle
This will cause it to become the

00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:06.836 A:middle
current activity, whenever that

00:36:06.836 --> 00:36:08.056 A:middle
viewController is presented.

00:36:09.526 --> 00:36:10.326 A:middle
And, that's all you need to do

00:36:10.326 --> 00:36:11.356 A:middle
on the originating device.

00:36:12.946 --> 00:36:14.776 A:middle
On the continuing device, first

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:15.886 A:middle
of all, your app needs to

00:36:15.886 --> 00:36:18.096 A:middle
declare support for the type of

00:36:18.096 --> 00:36:19.316 A:middle
activity that you created.

00:36:20.186 --> 00:36:21.606 A:middle
Then, you need to implement two

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.656 A:middle
UIApplicationDelegate callbacks.

00:36:24.736 --> 00:36:25.926 A:middle
The first is application

00:36:25.926 --> 00:36:26.796 A:middle
willContinueUser

00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:27.616 A:middle
ActivityWithType.

00:36:27.956 --> 00:36:29.646 A:middle
And, this is called as soon as

00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:32.086 A:middle
you click or tap on the icon to

00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:33.216 A:middle
initiate the handoff.

00:36:34.356 --> 00:36:36.016 A:middle
At this point, we don't have the

00:36:36.016 --> 00:36:37.616 A:middle
NSUserActivity object ready yet,

00:36:38.376 --> 00:36:39.436 A:middle
but you know the kind of

00:36:39.436 --> 00:36:40.306 A:middle
activity that's going to be

00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:42.136 A:middle
continued, so you can begin

00:36:42.136 --> 00:36:43.916 A:middle
preparing your UI.

00:36:44.506 --> 00:36:46.316 A:middle
Very shortly after, you'll

00:36:46.316 --> 00:36:46.696 A:middle
receive

00:36:46.696 --> 00:36:48.716 A:middle
applicationContinueRestoration

00:36:48.716 --> 00:36:50.876 A:middle
handler, which will contain the

00:36:50.876 --> 00:36:52.016 A:middle
fully reconstructed

00:36:52.016 --> 00:36:53.296 A:middle
NSUserActivity object.

00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:56.496 A:middle
From that point, you can set up

00:36:56.496 --> 00:36:58.766 A:middle
and continue the experience

00:36:58.766 --> 00:36:59.526 A:middle
right on that device.
