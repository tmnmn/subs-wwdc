00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:00.536 A:middle
to help preserve this illusion

00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:02.416 A:middle
of your app's content sliding on

00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:03.826 A:middle
this magic sheet of glass.

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.776 A:middle
At Apple, we've got a phrase

00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:07.956 A:middle
that we like to say, that your

00:28:07.956 --> 00:28:09.736 A:middle
app should feel smooth like

00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:10.046 A:middle
butter.

00:28:10.896 --> 00:28:13.446 A:middle
But, from time to time, you have

00:28:13.446 --> 00:28:15.226 A:middle
some hitches and stutters that

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:16.936 A:middle
make it feel less like butter,

00:28:17.606 --> 00:28:18.926 A:middle
and more like peanut butter.

00:28:20.296 --> 00:28:21.426 A:middle
And, you've seen this before.

00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:22.786 A:middle
Your app feels choppy or

00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:23.316 A:middle
stuttery.

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.726 A:middle
Ben, what are some causes of the

00:28:26.726 --> 00:28:28.256 A:middle
slow behavior in apps?

00:28:29.186 --> 00:28:30.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, Peter, this slow

00:28:30.656 --> 00:28:31.866 A:middle
behavior that you're describing

00:28:32.076 --> 00:28:34.166 A:middle
is really that we're dropping

00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:34.646 A:middle
frames.

00:28:35.316 --> 00:28:36.476 A:middle
And so, we need to understand

00:28:36.476 --> 00:28:37.466 A:middle
why that might be happening.

00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:39.216 A:middle
And, there are two key areas

00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:40.316 A:middle
where this can happen.

00:28:41.046 --> 00:28:42.386 A:middle
The first is you could be doing

00:28:42.426 --> 00:28:43.666 A:middle
too much computation.

00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:46.366 A:middle
And, the second is you could be

00:28:46.366 --> 00:28:48.196 A:middle
doing too much complex graphics

00:28:48.196 --> 00:28:48.836 A:middle
compositing.

00:28:50.236 --> 00:28:51.416 A:middle
Let's look at each of these in

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:53.766 A:middle
turn, starting with computation.

00:28:55.056 --> 00:28:56.346 A:middle
How do you know if you're doing

00:28:56.346 --> 00:28:57.286 A:middle
too much computation?

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.656 A:middle
Well, the Time Profiler, built
