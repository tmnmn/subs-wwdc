00:16:57.746 --> 00:17:00.206 A:middle
UIKitGestureRecognizers, it's

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:01.386 A:middle
important to understand the

00:17:01.386 --> 00:17:03.356 A:middle
difference between discrete and

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.726 A:middle
continuous gestures.

00:17:06.006 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
Discrete gestures tell you that

00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:08.736 A:middle
an event happened.

00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:10.826 A:middle
They start in the Possible

00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:13.026 A:middle
state, and then they don't pass

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:14.945 A:middle
go, they don't collect $200.

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:16.496 A:middle
They move immediately into the

00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:17.366 A:middle
Recognized state.

00:17:18.536 --> 00:17:20.556 A:middle
These are really useful for fire

00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:21.896 A:middle
and forget interactions in your

00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:24.366 A:middle
app, but won't tell you at every

00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:25.925 A:middle
phase during the interaction.

00:17:26.455 --> 00:17:28.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The other type of gestures

00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:30.116 A:middle
are continuous gestures.

00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:31.806 A:middle
These provide a much greater

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:33.096 A:middle
level of fidelity to you.

00:17:34.336 --> 00:17:35.586 A:middle
Like discrete gestures, they

00:17:35.586 --> 00:17:37.036 A:middle
start out in the Possible state,

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:38.666 A:middle
but as they begin to be

00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:40.326 A:middle
recognized, they move to the

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:41.096 A:middle
Began state.

00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:44.236 A:middle
As they track, they enter the

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:45.196 A:middle
Changed state.

00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:46.506 A:middle
And, at this point you're

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:48.026 A:middle
receiving a continuous stream of

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.716 A:middle
events as the gesture moves

00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:49.976 A:middle
around.

00:17:51.216 --> 00:17:52.766 A:middle
Finally, when the gesture is

00:17:53.176 --> 00:17:55.126 A:middle
complete, it moves to the Ended

00:17:55.126 --> 00:17:55.446 A:middle
state.

00:17:57.356 --> 00:17:58.976 A:middle
One of our favorite types of

00:17:58.976 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
continuous gestures is the
