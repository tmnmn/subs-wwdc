00:25:59.656 --> 00:26:00.866 A:middle
So, only bring in the views and

00:26:00.866 --> 00:26:02.576 A:middle
layers that you absolutely need

00:26:02.806 --> 00:26:03.726 A:middle
for your first frame.

00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:07.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The final phase of your

00:26:07.016 --> 00:26:09.636 A:middle
launch is what we call extended

00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:10.536 A:middle
launch actions.

00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:13.716 A:middle
These are tasks that you have

00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:15.656 A:middle
potentially deferred from your

00:26:15.656 --> 00:26:17.286 A:middle
launch path to help you get

00:26:17.286 --> 00:26:18.266 A:middle
responsive faster.

00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:20.586 A:middle
So, while your app may be

00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:22.766 A:middle
responsive at this point, it may

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:24.016 A:middle
not be very usable yet.

00:26:24.446 --> 00:26:26.936 A:middle
This phase is really all about

00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:28.786 A:middle
prioritizing what to do next.

00:26:29.506 --> 00:26:30.596 A:middle
Bring in the content that needs

00:26:30.596 --> 00:26:31.676 A:middle
to be onscreen right now.

00:26:33.036 --> 00:26:34.026 A:middle
And also, if you're loading

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:36.536 A:middle
content from a remote server, be

00:26:36.536 --> 00:26:38.156 A:middle
sure to consider that you may be

00:26:38.156 --> 00:26:39.066 A:middle
in challenging network

00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:39.566 A:middle
conditions.

00:26:40.096 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
And, have a placeholder UI ready

00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:43.806 A:middle
to go if necessary.

00:26:44.356 --> 00:26:47.326 A:middle
So, those are the five

00:26:47.326 --> 00:26:49.016 A:middle
high-level components that make

00:26:49.016 --> 00:26:50.836 A:middle
up the anatomy of a launch.

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.776 A:middle
We've one more thing for you

00:26:55.436 --> 00:26:56.486 A:middle
today.

00:26:56.766 --> 00:26:59.116 A:middle
ABM. A: Always.

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.216 A:middle
B: Be. M: Measuring.
