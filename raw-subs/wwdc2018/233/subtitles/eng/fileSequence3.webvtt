00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:01.026 A:middle
essential to any presentation.

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:04.126 A:middle
Or, maybe you have a game.

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:06.816 A:middle
But, typically you'd have soft,

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:07.986 A:middle
overlaid controls.

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:09.746 A:middle
Well, you could create an

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:11.756 A:middle
entirely custom interface to

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:14.106 A:middle
control your game, and put that

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:17.546 A:middle
on the iOS device's display, and

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:19.376 A:middle
have your full, unobstructed and

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:21.326 A:middle
immersive gaming experience on

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.276 A:middle
the external display.

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:27.536 A:middle
When designing your applications

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.016 A:middle
for an external display, there

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:31.066 A:middle
are some key things that you

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:32.506 A:middle
should think about.

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:35.386 A:middle
Aside from the obvious size

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:38.106 A:middle
differences, your iPhone is

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:38.736 A:middle
personal.

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:40.626 A:middle
And so, you should consider the

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:41.616 A:middle
kind of information that you

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:43.696 A:middle
show on this display as private.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:46.896 A:middle
Whereas, the external display

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.056 A:middle
will typically be situated in an

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.586 A:middle
environment where many people

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.696 A:middle
can see it, such as a TV in a

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.806 A:middle
living room, or a projection

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:55.946 A:middle
system in a conference hall.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:03:58.706 A:middle
So, you should assume that the

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:00.066 A:middle
information shown on this
