00:37:01.006 --> 00:37:01.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you've got more

00:37:01.896 --> 00:37:03.376 A:middle
information than can fit in a

00:37:03.376 --> 00:37:05.206 A:middle
userInfo dictionary, there's

00:37:05.206 --> 00:37:07.006 A:middle
great feature of NSUserActivity

00:37:07.006 --> 00:37:08.506 A:middle
that you can use, called

00:37:08.506 --> 00:37:10.006 A:middle
continuation streams.

00:37:10.776 --> 00:37:12.366 A:middle
All you have to do is set the

00:37:12.366 --> 00:37:14.126 A:middle
supportsContinuationStreams

00:37:14.126 --> 00:37:15.356 A:middle
property to true.

00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:18.706 A:middle
Then, on the continuing device,

00:37:19.206 --> 00:37:19.836 A:middle
you'll call the

00:37:19.836 --> 00:37:22.986 A:middle
getContinuationStreams method on

00:37:22.986 --> 00:37:24.836 A:middle
the NSUserActivity, which will

00:37:24.836 --> 00:37:26.466 A:middle
provide you with an input and an

00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:27.386 A:middle
output stream.

00:37:28.506 --> 00:37:30.196 A:middle
Back on the originating device,

00:37:30.796 --> 00:37:32.586 A:middle
the NSUserActivity's delegate

00:37:32.586 --> 00:37:33.846 A:middle
will receive a callback

00:37:34.076 --> 00:37:35.586 A:middle
providing it with input and

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.836 A:middle
output streams as well.

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:39.526 A:middle
And, through these channels, you

00:37:39.526 --> 00:37:40.556 A:middle
can do bi-directional

00:37:40.556 --> 00:37:42.276 A:middle
communication between the

00:37:42.276 --> 00:37:44.076 A:middle
originating and the continuing

00:37:44.076 --> 00:37:44.566 A:middle
device.

00:37:45.236 --> 00:37:46.006 A:middle
But, you're going to want to

00:37:46.006 --> 00:37:47.906 A:middle
finish this as fast as possible,

00:37:47.906 --> 00:37:49.736 A:middle
because the user may be moving

00:37:49.736 --> 00:37:51.286 A:middle
the devices apart to leave.

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.276 A:middle
For more about streams, check

00:37:54.276 --> 00:37:55.886 A:middle
out the Stream Programming Guide

00:37:55.886 --> 00:37:57.376 A:middle
on developer.apple.com.

00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:00.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, this is great for moving
