Great! The Xcode memory graph

00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:03.766 A:middle
debugger is such a great tool

00:50:03.766 --> 00:50:05.606 A:middle
for diagnosing issues like this

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:06.276 A:middle
in your app.

00:50:07.156 --> 00:50:08.656 A:middle
For even more, check out the

00:50:08.656 --> 00:50:10.426 A:middle
Debugging with Xcode 9 talk from

00:50:10.426 --> 00:50:11.656 A:middle
2017.

00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:14.756 A:middle
So, that's how you can debug

00:50:14.756 --> 00:50:16.256 A:middle
your app like a pro.

00:50:18.496 --> 00:50:20.426 A:middle
Make sure to think like a

00:50:20.426 --> 00:50:22.356 A:middle
detective whenever you encounter

00:50:22.356 --> 00:50:23.746 A:middle
problems with your program.

00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:27.776 A:middle
Use the Xcode view debugger, and

00:50:27.776 --> 00:50:29.896 A:middle
memory graph debugger to dive

00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:31.796 A:middle
deep on view- and memory-related

00:50:31.796 --> 00:50:32.326 A:middle
issues.

00:50:33.026 --> 00:50:36.066 A:middle
And, use LLDB's expression

00:50:36.586 --> 00:50:39.216 A:middle
command with dump, and all the

00:50:39.216 --> 00:50:40.596 A:middle
other great debugging methods we

00:50:40.596 --> 00:50:41.446 A:middle
talked about here.

00:50:44.316 --> 00:50:44.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:50:45.516 --> 00:50:51.846 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:50:52.346 --> 00:50:54.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, we've covered six really

00:50:54.356 --> 00:50:55.716 A:middle
exciting topics this morning,

00:50:56.306 --> 00:50:56.946 A:middle
this afternoon.

00:50:56.946 --> 00:50:59.836 A:middle
But, we've barely scratched the

00:50:59.836 --> 00:51:00.436 A:middle
surface.
