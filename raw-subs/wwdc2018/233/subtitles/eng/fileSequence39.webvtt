00:38:58.856 --> 00:39:00.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Handoff also supports web

00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:02.606 A:middle
browser-to-app handoffs.

00:39:03.576 --> 00:39:05.206 A:middle
You need to configure a list of

00:39:05.206 --> 00:39:06.766 A:middle
approved app IDs on your web

00:39:06.766 --> 00:39:08.756 A:middle
server, and then you need to add

00:39:08.756 --> 00:39:10.576 A:middle
an associated domain entitlement

00:39:11.066 --> 00:39:12.106 A:middle
in your iOS app.

00:39:12.646 --> 00:39:13.986 A:middle
And then, the user can

00:39:13.986 --> 00:39:15.516 A:middle
seamlessly continue from your

00:39:15.516 --> 00:39:17.616 A:middle
web experience to your app on

00:39:17.616 --> 00:39:18.126 A:middle
iOS.

00:39:18.876 --> 00:39:20.616 A:middle
For even more about this, check

00:39:20.616 --> 00:39:22.706 A:middle
out this great Handoff talk from

00:39:22.706 --> 00:39:23.726 A:middle
2014.

00:39:24.246 --> 00:39:26.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, that's Handoff.

00:39:27.566 --> 00:39:28.896 A:middle
Go out and implement it in your

00:39:28.896 --> 00:39:29.706 A:middle
applications.

00:39:29.936 --> 00:39:32.256 A:middle
Truly delight your users, and as

00:39:32.256 --> 00:39:33.756 A:middle
an added bonus, the

00:39:33.756 --> 00:39:35.806 A:middle
NSUserActivity API is used all

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.146 A:middle
over the system experiences.

00:39:37.296 --> 00:39:38.656 A:middle
In things like Spotlight search,

00:39:38.796 --> 00:39:40.116 A:middle
and the new Siri Shortcuts

00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:40.426 A:middle
feature.

00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:43.376 A:middle

00:39:43.376 --> 00:39:44.676 A:middle

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:45.446 A:middle
Thank you.
