00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:00.586 A:middle
do, is you need to identify and

00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:02.386 A:middle
track all of the state that

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:03.596 A:middle
affects your UI.

00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:07.356 A:middle
Then, every time that states

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.116 A:middle
changes, you should dirty the

00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:10.476 A:middle
layout system by calling

00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:11.466 A:middle
setNeedsLayout.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.496 A:middle
Finally, you'll want to update

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:17.176 A:middle
your UI with this state in

00:10:17.176 --> 00:10:18.006 A:middle
layoutSubviews.

00:10:18.936 --> 00:10:19.826 A:middle
And, that's it.

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:21.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, what I love about this

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:23.596 A:middle
recipe is just how easy it is to

00:10:23.596 --> 00:10:24.036 A:middle
follow.

00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:27.276 A:middle
And, if we apply layout-driven

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:29.216 A:middle
UI to our app holistically,

00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:32.106 A:middle
while considering the three core

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:33.486 A:middle
components of an iOS app,

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:36.226 A:middle
layout, animations, and

00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:38.646 A:middle
gestures, you'll find that our

00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:40.226 A:middle
implementation of all three of

00:10:40.226 --> 00:10:43.256 A:middle
these works harmoniously, in a

00:10:43.256 --> 00:10:44.516 A:middle
really awesome way.

00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:47.496 A:middle
Let's start with layout.

00:10:49.556 --> 00:10:51.586 A:middle
Layout is the process by which

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:53.026 A:middle
you position your application's

00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:54.476 A:middle
content onscreen.

00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:57.056 A:middle
But, we're also recommending

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.446 A:middle
that you do all other UI updates

00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:00.186 A:middle
in layout.
