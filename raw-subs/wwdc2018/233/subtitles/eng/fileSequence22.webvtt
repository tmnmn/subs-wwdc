00:21:58.956 --> 00:22:00.476 A:middle
is at this point, none of your

00:22:00.476 --> 00:22:01.146 A:middle
code has run.

00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:03.496 A:middle
So, it's vital that you

00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:05.396 A:middle
understand how to optimize this.

00:22:06.306 --> 00:22:07.186 A:middle
Peter, do you have any great

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:08.266 A:middle
advice for our developers?

00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:10.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm happy you asked, Ben.

00:22:10.626 --> 00:22:11.886 A:middle
It's important that you take

00:22:11.886 --> 00:22:14.076 A:middle
great care when optimizing the

00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:15.366 A:middle
linking phase of your app's

00:22:15.366 --> 00:22:15.896 A:middle
launch time.

00:22:16.236 --> 00:22:18.256 A:middle
Because it takes up such a large

00:22:18.256 --> 00:22:21.326 A:middle
amount of your launch time.

00:22:21.546 --> 00:22:23.016 A:middle
My first piece of advice for you

00:22:23.326 --> 00:22:25.066 A:middle
is to avoid code duplication

00:22:25.156 --> 00:22:26.316 A:middle
wherever possible.

00:22:26.546 --> 00:22:29.386 A:middle
If you have redundant functions,

00:22:29.576 --> 00:22:31.846 A:middle
objects, or structs, remove them

00:22:31.846 --> 00:22:32.376 A:middle
from your app.

00:22:32.746 --> 00:22:33.976 A:middle
Don't repeat yourself.

00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:36.716 A:middle
Next, you're going to want to

00:22:36.716 --> 00:22:38.456 A:middle
limit your use of third-party

00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:39.156 A:middle
libraries.

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:42.056 A:middle
iOS first-party libraries are

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:44.536 A:middle
cached, and may already be in

00:22:44.536 --> 00:22:46.036 A:middle
active memory if another

00:22:46.036 --> 00:22:47.376 A:middle
application is using them.

00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:50.006 A:middle
But, third-party libraries are

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:50.856 A:middle
not cached.

00:22:51.256 --> 00:22:52.726 A:middle
Even if another app is using the

00:22:52.726 --> 00:22:54.326 A:middle
same version of a library as

00:22:54.326 --> 00:22:56.246 A:middle
you, we'll still have to pull in

00:22:56.246 --> 00:22:58.026 A:middle
the framework if your app uses

00:22:58.026 --> 00:22:58.166 A:middle
it.

00:22:58.386 --> 00:23:00.166 A:middle
So, you should really limit your
