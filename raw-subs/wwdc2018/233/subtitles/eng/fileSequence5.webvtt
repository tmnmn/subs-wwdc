00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:02.566 A:middle
Let's start with connectivity.

00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:05.146 A:middle
How do you know if you have an

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:06.446 A:middle
external display connected?

00:05:07.836 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
UIScreen has a class variable,

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:12.076 A:middle
screens, which contains a list

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.576 A:middle
of all the connected displays,

00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:15.226 A:middle
including the device, built into

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:15.506 A:middle
the iPhone.

00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:18.256 A:middle
So, if there's more than one

00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:20.596 A:middle
element in this array, you know

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:21.946 A:middle
you have an external display

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:22.526 A:middle
connected.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.446 A:middle
Additionally, because the

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:27.556 A:middle
external display can be

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:29.366 A:middle
connected and disconnected at

00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:31.986 A:middle
will, UIKit will post

00:05:31.986 --> 00:05:33.666 A:middle
notifications to help you know

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:34.476 A:middle
when this happens.

00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:36.576 A:middle
So, you should listen for the

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:37.356 A:middle
UIScreen

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:39.676 A:middle
.didConnectNotification, and the

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:40.296 A:middle
UIScreen

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:41.846 A:middle
.didDisconnectNotifications.

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:43.976 A:middle
And, bring up and tear down your

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:44.566 A:middle
UI accordingly.

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:47.346 A:middle
Peter, can you show our

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:48.836 A:middle
developers just how easy it is

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:49.856 A:middle
to set up a second user

00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:50.286 A:middle
interface?

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:52.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ben, I'd be happy to.

00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:54.476 A:middle
Let's jump into our code for our

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:56.466 A:middle
UIScreen connection callback.

00:05:57.776 --> 00:05:59.626 A:middle
Here, we'll set a local variable

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:01.086 A:middle
to the last screen in the
