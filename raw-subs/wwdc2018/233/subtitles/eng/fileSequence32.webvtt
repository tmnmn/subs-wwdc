00:31:58.686 --> 00:32:00.616 A:middle
blurs, as this will cause the

00:32:00.616 --> 00:32:02.576 A:middle
GPU to work in overdrive,

00:32:02.726 --> 00:32:03.746 A:middle
slowing down your app.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:07.196 A:middle
Also, you should avoid masking

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:09.116 A:middle
and clipping wherever possible.

00:32:10.056 --> 00:32:11.926 A:middle
Instead, if you can achieve the

00:32:11.926 --> 00:32:14.636 A:middle
same visual appearance by just

00:32:14.636 --> 00:32:16.576 A:middle
placing opaque content on top of

00:32:16.576 --> 00:32:18.186 A:middle
your views, then I would

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.286 A:middle
encourage you to too that,

00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:20.706 A:middle
instead of using the masked

00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:23.126 A:middle
view, or masked property of

00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:24.406 A:middle
UIViewer CA Layer.

00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:27.046 A:middle
So, that's how we can optimize

00:32:27.206 --> 00:32:28.756 A:middle
smooth scrolling performance.

00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:30.656 A:middle
Make sure to run the Time

Profiler, and Core Animation

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:33.786 A:middle
instruments on your apps.

00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:36.756 A:middle
Use prefetching, and push as

00:32:36.756 --> 00:32:38.326 A:middle
much work as possible off of the

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:38.986 A:middle
main queue.

00:32:39.526 --> 00:32:42.866 A:middle
And, try to use visual effects,

00:32:42.866 --> 00:32:44.086 A:middle
and masking and clipping

00:32:44.366 --> 00:32:45.046 A:middle
sparingly.

00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.766 A:middle
For even more information about

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:49.656 A:middle
profiling, check out this great

00:32:49.656 --> 00:32:51.726 A:middle
talk from WWDC 2015.

00:32:51.726 --> 00:32:51.956 A:middle
Thank you.
