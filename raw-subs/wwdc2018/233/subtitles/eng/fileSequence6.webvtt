00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:01.086 A:middle
to the last screen in the

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:01.826 A:middle
screens array.

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:03.506 A:middle
We know that this is the

00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:05.186 A:middle
external screen, because we're

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:05.686 A:middle
inside of our

00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:07.696 A:middle
didConnectNotification callback.

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:10.926 A:middle
Next, we'll make a new UI window

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:12.186 A:middle
to show on this external

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:12.676 A:middle
display.

00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:14.936 A:middle
And, we'll assign its screen

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:16.786 A:middle
property to the screen.

00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:18.436 A:middle
Next, we're going to want to

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:19.906 A:middle
make sure we set up this window.

00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:21.456 A:middle
We factored this into a

00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:23.146 A:middle
function, but all we're doing

00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:24.276 A:middle
here is making a root view

00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:25.786 A:middle
controller, and sticking it on

00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:27.856 A:middle
the window, the same way we'd do

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:29.146 A:middle
for the onboard display.

00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:31.416 A:middle
And, finally, we're going to

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.436 A:middle
mark this window as not hidden

00:06:33.566 --> 00:06:34.816 A:middle
to show it on the external

00:06:34.816 --> 00:06:35.236 A:middle
screen.

00:06:36.316 --> 00:06:37.386 A:middle
So, that's connection.

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:38.476 A:middle
Now, let's look at

00:06:38.476 --> 00:06:39.956 A:middle
disconnection, which is even

00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:40.496 A:middle
easier.

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:42.536 A:middle
So, here we are inside of our

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.436 A:middle
UIScreen

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:45.226 A:middle
.didDisconnectNotification

00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:47.066 A:middle
handler, and all we have to do

00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:49.486 A:middle
here is hide the window, and nil

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:50.826 A:middle
out our local reference to it,

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.366 A:middle
to free up any resources.

00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:53.296 A:middle
And, that's it.

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:54.636 A:middle
We've implemented screen

00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:56.266 A:middle
connection and disconnection in

00:06:56.266 --> 00:06:56.596 A:middle
our app.

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:58.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow, Peter, that was really

00:06:58.256 --> 00:06:58.696 A:middle
easy.
