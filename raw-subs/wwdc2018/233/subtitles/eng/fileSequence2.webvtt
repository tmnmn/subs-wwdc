When you tap on a photo

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:03.626 A:middle
thumbnail, the photo slides in,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:04.586 A:middle
and it's full screen.

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:07.556 A:middle
And, this entire experience is

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.166 A:middle
replicated on the external

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:09.566 A:middle
display.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.646 A:middle
To take full advantage of the

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:14.606 A:middle
size of the external display, we

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:15.716 A:middle
can rotate the iPhone to

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.146 A:middle
landscape to fill it up.

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:20.916 A:middle
And, this is great, with no work

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.506 A:middle
on our part, we were able to get

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:23.276 A:middle
this experience.

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:27.136 A:middle
But, we can do better than this.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.316 A:middle
Built right into iOS, are APIs

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.036 A:middle
that allow you to create an

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:34.576 A:middle
entirely custom, second user

00:02:34.576 --> 00:02:36.446 A:middle
interface on this externally

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:36.976 A:middle
connected display.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:40.766 A:middle
Let's take a look at a couple of

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.246 A:middle
examples of apps that have done

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:45.396 A:middle
this.

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:47.386 A:middle
Keynote is a great example.

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:49.856 A:middle
On the external display, you

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:51.996 A:middle
remain focused on the primary

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:52.796 A:middle
slide at hand.

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:55.106 A:middle
But, on the integrated iPhone

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:56.836 A:middle
display, you can see presenter

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.166 A:middle
notes, and the next slide, tools

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:01.026 A:middle
essential to any presentation.
