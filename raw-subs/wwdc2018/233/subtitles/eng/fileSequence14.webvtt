00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:00.096 A:middle
starting with animations.

00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:03.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Animations are the hallmark

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:05.486 A:middle
of any great iOS experience.

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:08.116 A:middle
The life-like motion of your

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:10.716 A:middle
user interface truly makes your

00:14:11.376 --> 00:14:12.486 A:middle
apps feel alive.

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:14.156 A:middle
UIKit has some great API

00:14:14.296 --> 00:14:15.756 A:middle
available to help you create

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:17.746 A:middle
these delightful animations.

00:14:18.636 --> 00:14:20.716 A:middle
The UIViewPropertyAnimator API

00:14:21.096 --> 00:14:23.246 A:middle
is a really powerful tool, and

00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:24.776 A:middle
it was turbocharged last year

00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:26.006 A:middle
with a bunch of new features.

00:14:27.036 --> 00:14:28.126 A:middle
To learn all about how to use

00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:29.406 A:middle
it, check out Advanced

00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:32.086 A:middle
Animations from UIKit from WWDC

00:14:32.086 --> 00:14:33.246 A:middle
2017.

00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:36.496 A:middle
In addition to this, the tried

00:14:36.496 --> 00:14:38.536 A:middle
and true UIView closure API is

00:14:38.536 --> 00:14:39.876 A:middle
also a great way to make these

00:14:39.876 --> 00:14:40.436 A:middle
animations.

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:43.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, great.

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:46.286 A:middle
We can use UIViewAnimations with

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.096 A:middle
our layout-driven UI-based app.

00:14:49.086 --> 00:14:50.816 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind, is

00:14:50.816 --> 00:14:51.756 A:middle
we're always going to want to

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:53.666 A:middle
use the beginFromCurrentState

00:14:53.806 --> 00:14:54.726 A:middle
animation option.

00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:57.746 A:middle
This tells UIKit to take the

00:14:57.746 --> 00:14:59.486 A:middle
current onscreen position of

00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:01.106 A:middle
your view, even if it's
