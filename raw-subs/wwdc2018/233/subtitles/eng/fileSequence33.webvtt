00:32:58.446 --> 00:33:00.486 A:middle
magical experiences across Apple

00:33:00.486 --> 00:33:01.096 A:middle
platforms.

00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:04.676 A:middle
And, Handoff is a fantastic way

00:33:04.676 --> 00:33:06.486 A:middle
to truly delight your customers.

00:33:07.746 --> 00:33:10.096 A:middle
The ability to take a task from

00:33:10.096 --> 00:33:12.476 A:middle
one device, and seamlessly

00:33:12.476 --> 00:33:14.516 A:middle
transition it to another device

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:16.976 A:middle
is an absolutely awesome

00:33:16.976 --> 00:33:17.546 A:middle
experience.

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:20.836 A:middle
Handoff works between iOS,

00:33:21.306 --> 00:33:22.596 A:middle
macOS, and watchOS.

00:33:23.736 --> 00:33:24.906 A:middle
It doesn't require an internet

00:33:24.906 --> 00:33:26.006 A:middle
connection because it uses

00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:27.806 A:middle
peer-to-peer connectivity, and

00:33:28.436 --> 00:33:30.626 A:middle
best of all for all of you, is

00:33:30.626 --> 00:33:32.606 A:middle
it's really easy to set up.

00:33:33.396 --> 00:33:35.016 A:middle
So, how should you think about

00:33:35.016 --> 00:33:36.136 A:middle
using Handoff in your

00:33:36.136 --> 00:33:36.706 A:middle
applications?

00:33:38.106 --> 00:33:39.116 A:middle
Well, let's go through a few

00:33:39.116 --> 00:33:41.346 A:middle
examples of how we do it in some

00:33:41.346 --> 00:33:42.776 A:middle
of our Apple apps.

00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:45.506 A:middle
Let's say I get a message from

00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:47.926 A:middle
my handsome co-presenter, and I

00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:49.726 A:middle
want to reply on my iPhone X

00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:50.946 A:middle
with a humorous animoji.

00:33:52.286 --> 00:33:53.636 A:middle
Well, I can get right back into

00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:55.356 A:middle
that conversation, right from

00:33:55.356 --> 00:33:57.986 A:middle
the App Switcher on iOS.

00:33:58.876 --> 00:34:00.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Or, if I'm editing a document
