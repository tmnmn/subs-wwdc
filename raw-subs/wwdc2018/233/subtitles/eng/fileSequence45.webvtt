00:44:58.986 --> 00:45:01.136 A:middle
printHierarchy, we can get an

00:45:01.136 --> 00:45:02.746 A:middle
output of all of our presenting

00:45:02.746 --> 00:45:04.826 A:middle
viewControllers, our presented

00:45:04.826 --> 00:45:06.926 A:middle
viewControllers, our

00:45:06.976 --> 00:45:08.246 A:middle
parentViewControllers and

00:45:08.246 --> 00:45:10.466 A:middle
childViewControllers, and even

00:45:10.466 --> 00:45:11.966 A:middle
our presentationControllers.

00:45:12.306 --> 00:45:13.616 A:middle
It's Controllerpalooza.

00:45:14.436 --> 00:45:16.466 A:middle
So, let's run printHierarchy in

00:45:16.466 --> 00:45:17.296 A:middle
our screenshot UI.

00:45:19.176 --> 00:45:20.906 A:middle
Here we can see our

00:45:20.906 --> 00:45:22.136 A:middle
viewController hierarchy.

00:45:22.476 --> 00:45:23.506 A:middle
And, when we inspect the

00:45:23.506 --> 00:45:24.716 A:middle
viewController that we're having

00:45:24.716 --> 00:45:26.476 A:middle
the problem with, we can see

00:45:26.476 --> 00:45:28.096 A:middle
that it's stuck in the appearing

00:45:28.096 --> 00:45:28.486 A:middle
state.

00:45:29.366 --> 00:45:30.936 A:middle
So, we had missed a callback.

00:45:31.136 --> 00:45:32.666 A:middle
And so, we need to look into our

00:45:32.666 --> 00:45:34.256 A:middle
app to where we're calling this

00:45:34.286 --> 00:45:35.986 A:middle
callback, and then we found the

00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:36.396 A:middle
issue.

00:45:37.516 --> 00:45:38.136 A:middle
So, great.

00:45:38.576 --> 00:45:39.956 A:middle
Using these methods, you can

00:45:39.956 --> 00:45:41.926 A:middle
identify view and viewController

00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:42.476 A:middle
issues.

00:45:43.156 --> 00:45:44.366 A:middle
But, sometimes you have a more

00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:46.156 A:middle
fundamental issue with your app.

00:45:46.976 --> 00:45:48.716 A:middle
And, for that we can use some

00:45:48.716 --> 00:45:50.326 A:middle
great state debugging tips that

00:45:50.326 --> 00:45:50.986 A:middle
we have for you.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:55.066 A:middle
LLDB's expression command can

00:45:55.066 --> 00:45:56.766 A:middle
let you run arbitrary code in

00:45:56.766 --> 00:45:57.296 A:middle
the debugger.

00:45:58.066 --> 00:45:58.786 A:middle
Think about that.

00:45:58.786 --> 00:46:00.676 A:middle
Any code that you can run in the
