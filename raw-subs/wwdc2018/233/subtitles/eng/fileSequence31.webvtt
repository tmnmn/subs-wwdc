00:30:57.976 --> 00:31:00.276 A:middle
computation, we could still be

00:31:00.276 --> 00:31:01.666 A:middle
having problems with our

00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:02.486 A:middle
graphics system.

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.156 A:middle
Fortunately, there's another

00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:07.346 A:middle
great tool available here.

00:31:07.936 --> 00:31:11.286 A:middle
The Core Animation instrument is

00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:12.986 A:middle
a really powerful way to see

00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:14.306 A:middle
exactly what your frame rate is

00:31:14.346 --> 00:31:14.656 A:middle
doing.

00:31:15.296 --> 00:31:16.686 A:middle
And, also at the same time,

00:31:16.936 --> 00:31:18.636 A:middle
looking at your GPU utilization.

00:31:20.076 --> 00:31:21.506 A:middle
It's another really powerful

00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:21.866 A:middle
tool.

00:31:22.156 --> 00:31:23.276 A:middle
And, to learn all about how to

00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:24.846 A:middle
use it, check out Advanced

Graphics and Animations for iOS

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:30.636 A:middle
Apps from WWDC 2014.

&gt;&gt; Once you've identified that

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.816 A:middle
your app is graphics-bound,

00:31:34.146 --> 00:31:35.776 A:middle
we've got some great low-hanging

00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:37.096 A:middle
fruit for you to investigate.

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:39.396 A:middle
Usually, you have a

00:31:39.396 --> 00:31:40.886 A:middle
graphics-bound app due to

00:31:40.886 --> 00:31:42.986 A:middle
overuse of one of two things:

00:31:43.696 --> 00:31:45.826 A:middle
visual effects, or masking and

00:31:45.826 --> 00:31:46.276 A:middle
clipping.

00:31:47.186 --> 00:31:49.226 A:middle
Visual effects, like blur and

00:31:49.226 --> 00:31:51.476 A:middle
vibrancy, are expensive, and so

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:52.876 A:middle
you should use them tastefully

00:31:53.056 --> 00:31:53.936 A:middle
within your apps.

00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:56.766 A:middle
You should also definitely avoid

00:31:56.906 --> 00:31:58.686 A:middle
things like blurs on blurs on

00:31:58.686 --> 00:32:00.616 A:middle
blurs, as this will cause the
