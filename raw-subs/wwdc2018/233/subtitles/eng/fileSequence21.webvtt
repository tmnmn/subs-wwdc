make up the anatomy of a launch.

00:21:02.536 --> 00:21:03.986 A:middle
Starting with number one,

00:21:04.716 --> 00:21:05.656 A:middle
process forking.

00:21:07.096 --> 00:21:08.486 A:middle
Peter, what can we do in this

00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:09.256 A:middle
phase of the launch?

00:21:10.196 --> 00:21:12.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, for process forking,

00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:13.396 A:middle
it's really complicated.

00:21:13.796 --> 00:21:14.576 A:middle
You're going to want to read the

00:21:14.576 --> 00:21:17.166 A:middle
Man pages for fork and exec, and

00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:19.056 A:middle
familiarize yourself with POSIX

00:21:19.056 --> 00:21:19.796 A:middle
fundamentals.

00:21:20.076 --> 00:21:21.226 A:middle
No, no, I'm just kidding.

00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:23.456 A:middle
iOS will take care of process

00:21:23.456 --> 00:21:24.236 A:middle
forking for you.

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:26.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We'll deal with number one

00:21:26.726 --> 00:21:27.096 A:middle
for you.

00:21:27.156 --> 00:21:27.976 A:middle
Let's look at number two.

00:21:28.516 --> 00:21:30.816 A:middle
[ Audience Laughter ]

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:32.416 A:middle
Dynamic linking.

00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:36.666 A:middle
At this phase, we're allocating

00:21:36.666 --> 00:21:38.236 A:middle
memory to begin executing your

00:21:38.236 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
application.

00:21:39.926 --> 00:21:41.096 A:middle
We're linking libraries and

00:21:41.096 --> 00:21:41.766 A:middle
frameworks.

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:43.896 A:middle
We're initializing Swift,

00:21:43.896 --> 00:21:45.476 A:middle
Objective-C, and Foundation.

00:21:46.446 --> 00:21:47.626 A:middle
And, we're doing static object

00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:48.746 A:middle
initialization as well.

00:21:49.286 --> 00:21:51.636 A:middle
And, typically we see this can

00:21:51.636 --> 00:21:54.686 A:middle
take 40 to 50% of the typical

00:21:54.686 --> 00:21:56.466 A:middle
launch time of an app.

00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:58.606 A:middle
And, one key thing to remember

00:21:58.956 --> 00:22:00.476 A:middle
is at this point, none of your
