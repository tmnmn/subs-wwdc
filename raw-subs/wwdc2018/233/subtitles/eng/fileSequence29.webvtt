Well, the Time Profiler, built

00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:01.816 A:middle
into Instruments, is the

00:29:01.816 --> 00:29:02.796 A:middle
ultimate tool for this.

00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:05.586 A:middle
It can give you down to the line

00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:07.686 A:middle
measurements for just how much

00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:09.366 A:middle
CPU time your code is using.

00:29:10.236 --> 00:29:12.226 A:middle
It's a really powerful tool, and

00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:13.336 A:middle
we encourage you to go and check

00:29:13.336 --> 00:29:14.876 A:middle
out Using the Time Profiler in

00:29:14.876 --> 00:29:17.556 A:middle
Instruments from WWDC 2016.

00:29:18.936 --> 00:29:20.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, once you've identified

00:29:20.176 --> 00:29:21.956 A:middle
these hot spots, using the Time

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:23.916 A:middle
Profiler tool, we've got some

00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:25.716 A:middle
great tips for you to optimize

00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:25.896 A:middle
them.

00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:28.476 A:middle
The first is to use

00:29:28.476 --> 00:29:30.686 A:middle
UICollectionView and UITableView

00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:31.496 A:middle
prefetching.

00:29:32.296 --> 00:29:33.656 A:middle
These are pieces of API that

00:29:33.656 --> 00:29:35.456 A:middle
will tell you while the user is

00:29:35.456 --> 00:29:36.976 A:middle
scrolling towards particular

00:29:36.976 --> 00:29:38.816 A:middle
cells, and can give you an

00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:40.386 A:middle
opportunity to preload that

00:29:40.386 --> 00:29:40.696 A:middle
data.

00:29:41.676 --> 00:29:43.396 A:middle
There was a wonderful talk given

00:29:43.396 --> 00:29:45.096 A:middle
by two very handsome presenters

00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:47.136 A:middle
on this in 2016 that I encourage

00:29:47.136 --> 00:29:47.636 A:middle
you to watch.

00:29:49.216 --> 00:29:51.146 A:middle
The next tip that I have for

00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:53.226 A:middle
you, is to push as much work as

00:29:53.226 --> 00:29:55.226 A:middle
possible off of the main queue

00:29:55.436 --> 00:29:56.876 A:middle
and onto background queues,

00:29:57.166 --> 00:29:58.446 A:middle
freeing up the main queue to

00:29:58.636 --> 00:30:00.606 A:middle
update your UI and handle user
