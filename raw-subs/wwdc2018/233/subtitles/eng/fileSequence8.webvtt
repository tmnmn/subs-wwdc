Watch what happens when we plug

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:01.976 A:middle
it in.

00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.216 A:middle
What happened here, is we popped

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:09.406 A:middle
our viewController back to the

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.546 A:middle
thumbnail view while

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:12.616 A:middle
simultaneously showing that

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:14.546 A:middle
previously selected photo full

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.286 A:middle
size on the external display.

00:08:16.286 --> 00:08:19.846 A:middle
And, it's these graceful

00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:21.466 A:middle
transitions that really help

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.546 A:middle
preserve the context, and help

00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:24.926 A:middle
your customers understand where

00:08:24.926 --> 00:08:26.136 A:middle
they are in your app's flow.

00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:29.416 A:middle
So, that's external display

00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:29.916 A:middle
support.

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:31.846 A:middle
It's really easy to set up.

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:33.736 A:middle
Just consider the different

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:35.316 A:middle
display contexts when designing

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:37.395 A:middle
your application, and be sure to

00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:38.426 A:middle
handle connection changes

00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:38.996 A:middle
gracefully.

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:41.976 A:middle
To learn more about this, check

00:08:41.976 --> 00:08:44.596 A:middle
out this talk from WWDC 2011.

00:08:44.596 --> 00:08:44.876 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:08:51.756 --> 00:08:53.586 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Layout-driven UI is a

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:55.726 A:middle
powerful way to write your app

00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:57.376 A:middle
to make it easier to add

00:08:57.376 --> 00:09:00.176 A:middle
features, and easier to debug.
