00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:00.616 A:middle
variable changes, we're

00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:02.916 A:middle
triggering setNeedsLayout, using

00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:03.876 A:middle
one of Swift's property

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:04.466 A:middle
observers.

00:19:06.306 --> 00:19:07.696 A:middle
Next, inside of our

00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:09.636 A:middle
panGestureRecognizer callback

00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.226 A:middle
function, we're just going to

00:19:11.226 --> 00:19:12.936 A:middle
grab the current translation and

00:19:12.936 --> 00:19:15.096 A:middle
view out of the gesture, and

00:19:15.186 --> 00:19:17.356 A:middle
associate this gesture to one of

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:18.016 A:middle
our cards.

00:19:18.916 --> 00:19:21.776 A:middle
We'll then increment the offset

00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.336 A:middle
for this card in this

00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:23.916 A:middle
dictionary.

00:19:25.276 --> 00:19:27.876 A:middle
And finally, in layoutSubviews,

00:19:28.546 --> 00:19:30.086 A:middle
we'll make sure to update the

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.676 A:middle
position of our card views based

00:19:32.676 --> 00:19:34.336 A:middle
on their offsets from this

00:19:34.336 --> 00:19:34.866 A:middle
dictionary.

00:19:36.076 --> 00:19:37.926 A:middle
Notice again how we're not

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.866 A:middle
really doing anything special,

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:41.546 A:middle
other than -- besides the

00:19:41.546 --> 00:19:42.806 A:middle
traditional layout-driven UI

00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:43.356 A:middle
case.

00:19:44.196 --> 00:19:45.816 A:middle
We just have this piece of state

00:19:46.016 --> 00:19:47.296 A:middle
that happens to be driven by a

00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:49.266 A:middle
gesture, and we're responding to

00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:50.476 A:middle
it in layoutSubviews.

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:53.406 A:middle
In fact, if you follow this

00:19:53.406 --> 00:19:54.886 A:middle
pattern throughout your app,

00:19:55.476 --> 00:19:56.496 A:middle
you'll find that it makes a lot

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:57.646 A:middle
of these types of interactions

00:19:57.786 --> 00:19:59.266 A:middle
much easier to adopt.
