00:08:57.376 --> 00:09:00.176 A:middle
features, and easier to debug.

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:03.486 A:middle
Layout-driven UI helps us deal

00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:04.996 A:middle
with the number one cause of

00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:07.786 A:middle
issues in iOS apps, and that's

00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:10.026 A:middle
managing UI complexity.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.226 A:middle
I'm sure you've been here

00:09:12.226 --> 00:09:12.726 A:middle
before.

00:09:12.816 --> 00:09:13.656 A:middle
I know I have.

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.016 A:middle
You add some code, and a gesture

00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:16.636 A:middle
callback.

00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:18.986 A:middle
You add even more UI update code

00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:20.446 A:middle
in a notification callback.

00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:22.376 A:middle
And, more when you get a value

00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:24.376 A:middle
trigger from a UI control.

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:26.806 A:middle
And, suddenly your app is in

00:09:26.806 --> 00:09:28.176 A:middle
this weird, and hard to

00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:29.206 A:middle
understand state.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:30.956 A:middle
And, you have to follow these

00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:32.636 A:middle
strange orders to reproduce

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:33.966 A:middle
these unusual bugs.

00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:36.026 A:middle
And, as you add more features to

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:38.186 A:middle
your app, the problem gets worse

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:38.806 A:middle
and worse.

00:09:40.256 --> 00:09:42.286 A:middle
If we instead follow a simple

00:09:42.286 --> 00:09:44.106 A:middle
recipe, and push these UI

00:09:44.106 --> 00:09:47.706 A:middle
updates into layout, we can get

00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:49.066 A:middle
rid of these bugs, and make it

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:50.506 A:middle
much easier to add features.

00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
Let's walk through the recipe

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:54.876 A:middle
for adding layout-driven UI to

00:09:55.146 --> 00:09:56.146 A:middle
your app.

00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:58.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The first thing you should

00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:00.586 A:middle
do, is you need to identify and
