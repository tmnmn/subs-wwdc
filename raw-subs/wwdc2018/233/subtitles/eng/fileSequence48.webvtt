00:47:59.926 --> 00:48:02.826 A:middle
see by looking closely, that our

00:48:02.826 --> 00:48:06.156 A:middle
cropEnabled ivar is currently

00:48:06.776 --> 00:48:07.686 A:middle
set to no.

00:48:07.766 --> 00:48:09.156 A:middle
So, we have a good place to

00:48:09.306 --> 00:48:10.536 A:middle
start investigating this bug.

00:48:11.876 --> 00:48:12.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:48:13.296 --> 00:48:15.756 A:middle
Using dump and ivarDescription

00:48:15.876 --> 00:48:17.436 A:middle
are great ways to diagnose

00:48:17.466 --> 00:48:20.016 A:middle
problems with your app.

00:48:20.246 --> 00:48:22.226 A:middle
Another wonderful debugging tip

00:48:22.226 --> 00:48:23.426 A:middle
and trick that we have for you

00:48:23.726 --> 00:48:24.726 A:middle
is breakpoints.

00:48:25.726 --> 00:48:27.366 A:middle
Breakpoints let you pause the

00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:28.966 A:middle
program at arbitrary states of

00:48:28.966 --> 00:48:31.526 A:middle
execution, and run commands.

00:48:32.546 --> 00:48:34.916 A:middle
And, using the LLDB command

00:48:34.916 --> 00:48:37.396 A:middle
line, or the Xcode UI, you can

00:48:37.396 --> 00:48:39.296 A:middle
even add conditions before these

00:48:39.296 --> 00:48:40.976 A:middle
breakpoints are run, and

00:48:40.976 --> 00:48:42.586 A:middle
commands to run every time the

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:43.486 A:middle
breakpoint is hit.

00:48:44.676 --> 00:48:46.086 A:middle
Breakpoints are an essential

00:48:46.086 --> 00:48:47.586 A:middle
part of your debugging workflow.

00:48:48.126 --> 00:48:49.476 A:middle
And, you can use the expression

00:48:49.476 --> 00:48:51.246 A:middle
command, and dump, and

00:48:51.246 --> 00:48:52.956 A:middle
ivarDescription, with the

00:48:52.956 --> 00:48:54.136 A:middle
breakpoints that you set up in

00:48:54.136 --> 00:48:54.496 A:middle
Xcode.

00:48:54.956 --> 00:48:56.736 A:middle
I really encourage you to use

00:48:56.736 --> 00:48:58.166 A:middle
breakpoints next time you're

00:48:58.166 --> 00:48:59.586 A:middle
debugging an issue with your
