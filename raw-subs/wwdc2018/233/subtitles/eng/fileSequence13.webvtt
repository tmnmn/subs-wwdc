00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:00.876 A:middle
We'll override layoutSubviews,

00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:02.756 A:middle
and we'll updated the isHidden

00:13:02.756 --> 00:13:04.306 A:middle
property of our cool guy view

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:05.766 A:middle
based on the value of

00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:06.496 A:middle
feelingCool.

00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:07.926 A:middle
And, that's it.

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:09.576 A:middle
That's all you need to do to add

00:13:09.576 --> 00:13:10.986 A:middle
layout-driven UI to your app.

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.016 A:middle
Now, while this works really

00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:14.996 A:middle
well for this simple example, it

00:13:14.996 --> 00:13:16.746 A:middle
works well for some more complex

00:13:16.746 --> 00:13:17.436 A:middle
ones earlier.

00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:19.816 A:middle
Ben and I were up really late

00:13:19.816 --> 00:13:21.326 A:middle
last night playing this new

00:13:21.816 --> 00:13:23.766 A:middle
macOS The Gathering trading card

00:13:23.766 --> 00:13:25.016 A:middle
game, which is sweeping the

00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:25.806 A:middle
Apple campus.

00:13:27.066 --> 00:13:28.406 A:middle
We built this fun little deck

00:13:28.456 --> 00:13:29.896 A:middle
builder app to help us win the

00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:31.076 A:middle
tournament next weekend, which

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.266 A:middle
we're really going to do.

00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:34.266 A:middle
It lets you pick up and drag

00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:35.596 A:middle
these cards around, and you can

00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:36.856 A:middle
fling them into this little deck

00:13:36.856 --> 00:13:37.146 A:middle
area.

00:13:37.146 --> 00:13:39.176 A:middle
And, it's really fast, and fun,

00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:39.646 A:middle
and fluid.

00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:41.256 A:middle
We can pick up two cards at the

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:41.896 A:middle
same time.

00:13:42.496 --> 00:13:44.156 A:middle
I think with this app we can

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.216 A:middle
really show you how

00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:47.306 A:middle
layout-driven UI works, and

00:13:47.306 --> 00:13:48.636 A:middle
importantly, we can beat Ben's

00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:50.556 A:middle
officemate next weekend.

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:53.066 A:middle
So, let's walk through the other

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.636 A:middle
two core aspects of an iOS app,

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:56.526 A:middle
and how we can apply

00:13:56.526 --> 00:13:57.846 A:middle
layout-driven UI to them,

00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:00.096 A:middle
starting with animations.
