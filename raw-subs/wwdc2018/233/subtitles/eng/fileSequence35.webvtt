00:34:58.186 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
account all show that Handoff is

00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:01.476 A:middle
available.

00:35:02.586 --> 00:35:04.106 A:middle
On the Mac, you'll see an icon

00:35:04.346 --> 00:35:06.516 A:middle
down in the Dock.

00:35:06.746 --> 00:35:08.706 A:middle
When you click on this Mail

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.216 A:middle
icon, the activity will be

00:35:10.216 --> 00:35:13.366 A:middle
transferred over to the Mac, and

00:35:13.366 --> 00:35:14.906 A:middle
Mail can launch and continue

00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:15.956 A:middle
exactly where you left off.

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:19.686 A:middle
So, let's look at the code

00:35:19.686 --> 00:35:21.926 A:middle
necessary to set this up.

00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:26.236 A:middle
On the originating device, you

00:35:26.236 --> 00:35:27.386 A:middle
start by creating your

00:35:27.426 --> 00:35:29.076 A:middle
NSUserActivity with a given

00:35:29.166 --> 00:35:29.356 A:middle
type.

00:35:30.536 --> 00:35:31.546 A:middle
And, this type represents the

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.456 A:middle
kind of activity that your user

00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:34.366 A:middle
is currently doing.

00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:37.906 A:middle
You then set a title, and set

00:35:37.906 --> 00:35:39.636 A:middle
isEligibleForHandoff to true.

00:35:40.996 --> 00:35:42.186 A:middle
And you then want to populate

00:35:42.186 --> 00:35:43.606 A:middle
your userInfo dictionary.

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:45.636 A:middle
And, you need to fill this with

00:35:45.686 --> 00:35:47.736 A:middle
all the information necessary to

00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:48.996 A:middle
be able to continue the

00:35:48.996 --> 00:35:49.636 A:middle
activity.

00:35:50.806 --> 00:35:52.356 A:middle
In this case, our example is a

00:35:52.356 --> 00:35:53.876 A:middle
video, and we're including a

00:35:53.876 --> 00:35:55.766 A:middle
video ID, and a current play

00:35:55.836 --> 00:35:55.976 A:middle
time.

00:35:58.266 --> 00:35:59.966 A:middle
Finally, you'll want to set this

00:35:59.966 --> 00:36:00.816 A:middle
activity to your
