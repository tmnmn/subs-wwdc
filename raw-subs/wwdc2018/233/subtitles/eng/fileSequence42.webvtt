00:41:58.576 --> 00:42:00.346 A:middle
tools were missing, which is

00:42:00.346 --> 00:42:00.986 A:middle
pretty bad.

00:42:01.546 --> 00:42:04.656 A:middle
Ben, are there any tools we can

00:42:04.656 --> 00:42:06.276 A:middle
use to help diagnose this issue?

00:42:07.246 --> 00:42:07.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:42:08.556 --> 00:42:10.566 A:middle
Built right into Xcode, is the

00:42:10.566 --> 00:42:11.466 A:middle
View Debugger.

00:42:12.476 --> 00:42:13.726 A:middle
You can launch it by simply

00:42:13.726 --> 00:42:14.696 A:middle
clicking on this icon in the

00:42:14.696 --> 00:42:15.526 A:middle
bottom toolbar.

00:42:16.606 --> 00:42:18.526 A:middle
And, Xcode will show you a 3D

00:42:18.526 --> 00:42:20.136 A:middle
representation of your entire

00:42:20.136 --> 00:42:20.986 A:middle
view hierarchy.

00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:24.596 A:middle
As you can see here, our pencil

00:42:24.596 --> 00:42:26.506 A:middle
controls are still there, but

00:42:26.506 --> 00:42:27.956 A:middle
they're being occluded by this

00:42:27.956 --> 00:42:29.406 A:middle
full screen view in front of it.

00:42:30.686 --> 00:42:31.576 A:middle
So, we need to go and look at

00:42:31.626 --> 00:42:32.736 A:middle
where we're building this UI,

00:42:32.846 --> 00:42:33.736 A:middle
and see what's happening with

00:42:33.736 --> 00:42:34.526 A:middle
the ordering there, Peter, I

00:42:34.526 --> 00:42:34.786 A:middle
think.

00:42:36.036 --> 00:42:36.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:42:36.936 --> 00:42:38.396 A:middle
The Xcode View Debugger is a

00:42:38.396 --> 00:42:40.046 A:middle
wonderful tool for debugging

00:42:40.046 --> 00:42:41.616 A:middle
view issues in your app.

00:42:42.806 --> 00:42:44.216 A:middle
There are even more tools that

00:42:44.216 --> 00:42:46.536 A:middle
you can use to help out with

00:42:47.776 --> 00:42:47.876 A:middle
this.

00:42:48.096 --> 00:42:50.036 A:middle
UIView recursiveDescription,

00:42:50.696 --> 00:42:52.826 A:middle
UIView parentDescription, and

00:42:53.096 --> 00:42:54.156 A:middle
the class method

00:42:54.156 --> 00:42:56.196 A:middle
UIViewController printHierarchy

00:42:56.796 --> 00:42:58.566 A:middle
are great tools for debugging

00:42:58.566 --> 00:42:59.856 A:middle
view and view controller issues
