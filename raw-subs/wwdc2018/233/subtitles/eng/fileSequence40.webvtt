00:40:00.956 --> 00:40:02.996 A:middle
But, from time to time, you have

00:40:03.076 --> 00:40:04.006 A:middle
problems that you need to

00:40:04.006 --> 00:40:04.706 A:middle
investigate.

00:40:05.466 --> 00:40:07.286 A:middle
And, for that, we're going to

00:40:07.286 --> 00:40:09.256 A:middle
teach you some Matrix-level

00:40:09.256 --> 00:40:10.176 A:middle
debugging skills.

00:40:10.566 --> 00:40:12.866 A:middle
But first, a word of warning.

00:40:14.236 --> 00:40:15.986 A:middle
Before we give you this red

00:40:15.986 --> 00:40:17.616 A:middle
pill, and show you just how deep

00:40:17.616 --> 00:40:19.836 A:middle
the rabbit hole goes, I want to

00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:21.056 A:middle
let you know that the methods

00:40:21.056 --> 00:40:22.246 A:middle
that we're going to show you in

00:40:22.246 --> 00:40:23.976 A:middle
this section are great for

00:40:23.976 --> 00:40:25.866 A:middle
debugging, but must not be

00:40:25.866 --> 00:40:27.116 A:middle
submitted to the App Store.

00:40:27.946 --> 00:40:29.726 A:middle
If you do, your application will

00:40:29.726 --> 00:40:31.046 A:middle
be rejected, and you'll have a

00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:31.606 A:middle
bad day.

00:40:32.476 --> 00:40:34.056 A:middle
So, with that warning, let's get

00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:34.516 A:middle
started.

00:40:35.036 --> 00:40:37.276 A:middle
We're going to start with a

00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:38.576 A:middle
detective mindset.

00:40:38.966 --> 00:40:40.836 A:middle
How you should approach problems

00:40:40.836 --> 00:40:41.946 A:middle
that you find in your program.

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:44.366 A:middle
Next, we're going to talk to you

00:40:44.366 --> 00:40:45.886 A:middle
about how to debug issues with

00:40:45.886 --> 00:40:47.466 A:middle
your views and view controllers.

00:40:48.306 --> 00:40:49.406 A:middle
We're going to teach you about

00:40:49.406 --> 00:40:51.436 A:middle
LLDB, and how you can use it to

00:40:51.436 --> 00:40:53.066 A:middle
identify state issues in your

00:40:53.066 --> 00:40:53.386 A:middle
app.

00:40:54.336 --> 00:40:55.516 A:middle
And finally, we're going to look

00:40:55.516 --> 00:40:56.906 A:middle
at some techniques for some

00:40:56.906 --> 00:40:58.716 A:middle
great memory issues that you

00:40:58.716 --> 00:41:00.356 A:middle
might run into that make you
