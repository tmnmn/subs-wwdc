00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:00.596 A:middle
comparing cases where you can

00:21:00.596 --> 00:21:02.566 A:middle
clearly see good and bad pixels.

00:21:03.006 --> 00:21:04.456 A:middle
You can quickly switch between

00:21:04.456 --> 00:21:06.676 A:middle
them and see what the back pixel

00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:07.116 A:middle
is doing.

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:10.526 A:middle
Once we switch threads, we

00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:12.306 A:middle
update the execution history and

00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:14.456 A:middle
the variable views, so that you

00:21:14.456 --> 00:21:15.806 A:middle
can fully debug your

00:21:15.806 --> 00:21:17.606 A:middle
newly-selected threads.

00:21:19.096 --> 00:21:20.596 A:middle
This gets even better.

00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:23.276 A:middle
Detail views also help you

00:21:23.276 --> 00:21:24.836 A:middle
understand your divergence.

00:21:26.256 --> 00:21:29.706 A:middle
So whenever you enable detail

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:31.716 A:middle
view, the mask on the right-hand

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:34.716 A:middle
side will always show you what

00:21:34.786 --> 00:21:36.556 A:middle
other threads executed the same

00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:37.226 A:middle
line of code.

00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:40.456 A:middle
In this example, it's

00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:43.776 A:middle
conditional, and just looking at

00:21:43.776 --> 00:21:45.416 A:middle
the mask, I can clearly tell

00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:47.796 A:middle
that roughly half of my threads

00:21:48.086 --> 00:21:49.786 A:middle
executed inside this-- if

00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
conditional, in a diagonal

00:21:51.786 --> 00:21:52.046 A:middle
shape.

00:21:53.556 --> 00:21:57.276 A:middle
So now, to show you how you can

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.196 A:middle
use detail views to fix problems

00:21:59.196 --> 00:22:00.946 A:middle
in fragment shaders, I would
