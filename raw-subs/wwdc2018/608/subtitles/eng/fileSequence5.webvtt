00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
drawing the tree, and as you can

00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:03.236 A:middle
see, some of the vertices of the

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.876 A:middle
triangle is off screen, causing

00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:06.956 A:middle
this triangle to get skewed.

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:09.246 A:middle
Just using the geometry viewer,

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.676 A:middle
you can click on the visibly

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:11.296 A:middle
wrong triangle.

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.966 A:middle
And just using the viewer below,

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:17.466 A:middle
you can see all the data that

00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:20.516 A:middle
these vertices are taking in and

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:21.096 A:middle
outputting.

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:27.906 A:middle
And in our second case, I'm on

00:05:27.906 --> 00:05:29.736 A:middle
the same draw [inaudible] but

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:31.386 A:middle
this time, the tree is

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:33.386 A:middle
completely missing.

00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:34.636 A:middle
Just using the geometry viewer

00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:38.456 A:middle
and the free fly camera, you can

00:05:38.586 --> 00:05:40.426 A:middle
see that the tree is drawn

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:41.596 A:middle
completely outside of the

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:42.086 A:middle
Frustum.

00:05:43.536 --> 00:05:45.006 A:middle
So it makes sense that it is not

00:05:45.006 --> 00:05:45.816 A:middle
rendered on screen.

00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:48.526 A:middle
So it is really easy to use

00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:50.706 A:middle
geometry viewer to detect cases

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:53.416 A:middle
like this, and on to our last

00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:56.296 A:middle
case, sometimes it's not even

00:05:56.296 --> 00:05:57.946 A:middle
possible to form triangles to

00:05:58.176 --> 00:05:59.156 A:middle
visualize in 3D.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.576 A:middle
And these are tricky to debug.
