00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:27.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:28.396 A:middle
Welcome.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:30.756 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:31.066 A:middle
today.

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:32.716 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:35.946 A:middle
Shaders are important part of

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:37.906 A:middle
graphics, and they help you

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:39.896 A:middle
create great-looking games and

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:41.166 A:middle
apps.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:42.996 A:middle
Given the massively parallel

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:45.026 A:middle
execution environment, working

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:46.306 A:middle
with shaders is not easy.

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:48.076 A:middle
There are a number of things

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:49.556 A:middle
that can go wrong during

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:51.886 A:middle
development, and even when you

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:53.236 A:middle
get it right, they have to

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:54.406 A:middle
perform really fast.

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:57.426 A:middle
My name is Alp and today I am

00:00:57.626 --> 00:00:59.426 A:middle
going to show you great tools

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.126 A:middle
and workflows to help you debug
