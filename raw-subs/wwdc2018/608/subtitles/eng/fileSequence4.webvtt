00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.006 A:middle
combined all this data and

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:02.896 A:middle
created one place you can

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:04.526 A:middle
visualize and inspect it.

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:06.986 A:middle
Now, I would like to introduce

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:11.000 A:middle
you to geometry viewer.

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:15.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:17.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Geometry viewer is a new tool

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:19.166 A:middle
that visualizes the

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.146 A:middle
post-transform vertex data in 3D

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:22.896 A:middle
so that you can actually see

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.116 A:middle
what your vertex output is.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:27.126 A:middle
Alongside, it provides you your

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:29.876 A:middle
data input indices and output,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:31.136 A:middle
so that you can actually

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.706 A:middle
correlate that back to 3D.

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:35.526 A:middle
It is available per-draw call

00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:37.266 A:middle
just like your attachments and

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.176 A:middle
bond resources, so you'll have

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.996 A:middle
one place to investigate all

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:42.996 A:middle
your vertex issues.

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:47.336 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at three

00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:49.226 A:middle
common vertex problems, and

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.516 A:middle
let's see how you can use

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:52.306 A:middle
geometry viewer to tackle them.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:56.256 A:middle
So this is the first problem,

00:04:56.706 --> 00:04:58.506 A:middle
and I am going to draw call,

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.496 A:middle
drawing the tree, and as you can
