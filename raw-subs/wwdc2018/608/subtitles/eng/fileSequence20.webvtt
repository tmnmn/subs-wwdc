00:19:57.576 --> 00:20:00.196 A:middle
seeing a single variable for a

00:20:00.196 --> 00:20:02.056 A:middle
single pixel may not help you in

00:20:02.056 --> 00:20:02.716 A:middle
all the cases.

00:20:03.546 --> 00:20:05.136 A:middle
Here, I have an example, I'm

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:08.016 A:middle
calculating a gradient, and I

00:20:08.016 --> 00:20:09.156 A:middle
can't see the single gradient

00:20:09.156 --> 00:20:09.476 A:middle
value.

00:20:09.796 --> 00:20:11.546 A:middle
But I can't really tell whether

00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:13.256 A:middle
this gradient value is good for

00:20:13.256 --> 00:20:14.776 A:middle
my pixels, or bad for my pixels.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:18.306 A:middle
With a single click, to bring up

00:20:18.336 --> 00:20:21.106 A:middle
the detail views, I can see this

00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:23.136 A:middle
gradient value across thousands

00:20:23.136 --> 00:20:25.036 A:middle
of other pixels around my pixel,

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:27.596 A:middle
and now I can tell this gradient

00:20:27.596 --> 00:20:29.296 A:middle
is not correct because I can

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:31.236 A:middle
clearly see it's not smooth.

00:20:32.216 --> 00:20:34.146 A:middle
As you've seen, detail views

00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:35.716 A:middle
help you understand your shader,

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:39.456 A:middle
and identify good and bad values

00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:40.376 A:middle
for your shaders.

00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:44.506 A:middle
You can quickly hover into any

00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:47.116 A:middle
other pixel to instantly see the

00:20:47.116 --> 00:20:48.776 A:middle
value of that variable for that

00:20:48.776 --> 00:20:49.196 A:middle
pixel.

00:20:49.796 --> 00:20:54.036 A:middle
And you can also use this view

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.926 A:middle
to switch threads.

00:20:57.036 --> 00:20:58.826 A:middle
Switching threads is great for

00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:00.596 A:middle
comparing cases where you can
