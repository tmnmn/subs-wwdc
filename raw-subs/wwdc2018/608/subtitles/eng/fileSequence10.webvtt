00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.456 A:middle
smooth, but as we can see, there

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:01.596 A:middle
is a steep cliff.

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:03.696 A:middle
So let's pick one of the

00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:04.966 A:middle
triangles that looks wrong.

00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:06.276 A:middle
For example, this one.

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:08.596 A:middle
And now, let's select the broken

00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:10.576 A:middle
vertex that is the one here at

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:11.126 A:middle
the bottom.

00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:13.686 A:middle
You can easily do this, by using

00:10:13.686 --> 00:10:14.456 A:middle
this table here.

00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:17.816 A:middle
So now that we have found our

00:10:17.816 --> 00:10:20.316 A:middle
broken vertex, let's take the

00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:21.346 A:middle
input positions.

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:24.666 A:middle
As we can see here, all of the

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.496 A:middle
input positions are very similar

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:27.846 A:middle
for all of the vertices of this

00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:30.316 A:middle
triangle, and in fact, the white

00:10:30.316 --> 00:10:32.126 A:middle
coordinate is exactly the same.

00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:34.616 A:middle
So this looks correct, and it

00:10:34.616 --> 00:10:35.346 A:middle
was inspected.

00:10:35.766 --> 00:10:39.216 A:middle
Seeing the input is correct, but

00:10:39.216 --> 00:10:40.556 A:middle
as we can see here, in the 3D

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.076 A:middle
view, the output is wrong, then

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.566 A:middle
the problem has been our vertex

00:10:44.566 --> 00:10:44.946 A:middle
shader.

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:46.686 A:middle
So let's use the new Shader

00:10:46.686 --> 00:10:48.176 A:middle
Debugger to debug and fix this

00:10:48.176 --> 00:10:51.016 A:middle
issue, just by clicking on the

00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:52.556 A:middle
Debug button that you can find

00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:54.046 A:middle
here in the bottom right corner.

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:58.946 A:middle
And just like that, we are now

00:10:58.946 --> 00:10:59.896 A:middle
in the Shader Debugger.
