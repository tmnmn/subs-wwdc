This is just an example of how

00:26:00.146 --> 00:26:01.516 A:middle
you can use the Shader Debugger

00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:03.896 A:middle
and its powerful detailed views

00:26:04.086 --> 00:26:05.376 A:middle
to debug [inaudible] Shaders.

00:26:05.896 --> 00:26:06.426 A:middle
Thank you.

00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:07.466 A:middle
And back to Alp.

00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:11.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:12.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Xavier.

00:26:14.316 --> 00:26:16.316 A:middle
Now that you have seen

00:26:16.316 --> 00:26:17.196 A:middle
everything about Shader

00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:19.996 A:middle
Debugger, let's recap what we've

00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:22.526 A:middle
talked about so far.

00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:25.036 A:middle
Shader Debugger is specifically

00:26:25.036 --> 00:26:26.496 A:middle
designed for debugging Metal

00:26:26.496 --> 00:26:28.736 A:middle
shaders, taking into account of

00:26:28.736 --> 00:26:30.236 A:middle
the highly parallel nature of

00:26:30.236 --> 00:26:33.666 A:middle
GPUs, and as you've seen, it's

00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:36.066 A:middle
great for fixing bugs with the

00:26:36.066 --> 00:26:37.796 A:middle
highlights to nans and

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:40.456 A:middle
infinites, it is so easy to spot

00:26:40.456 --> 00:26:43.036 A:middle
common mistakes, and also it's

00:26:43.036 --> 00:26:44.706 A:middle
great for understanding your

00:26:44.706 --> 00:26:45.136 A:middle
shader.

00:26:45.976 --> 00:26:47.426 A:middle
With the detailed views, you

00:26:47.426 --> 00:26:48.836 A:middle
don't even need to read the code

00:26:49.116 --> 00:26:50.296 A:middle
to understand what your shader

00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:50.726 A:middle
is doing.

00:26:51.756 --> 00:26:53.996 A:middle
And also it provides excellent

00:26:53.996 --> 00:26:55.476 A:middle
environment to develop your

00:26:55.476 --> 00:26:56.066 A:middle
shaders in.

00:26:56.766 --> 00:26:58.016 A:middle
Just get into Shader Debugger

00:26:58.306 --> 00:27:01.356 A:middle
and start editing, and read out
