00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.806 A:middle
And it provides great profiling

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:05.336 A:middle
features, giving you access to

00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:06.466 A:middle
GPU counters and pipeline

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.186 A:middle
statistics.

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.746 A:middle
It is fully integrated into

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.586 A:middle
Xcode, providing you one place

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.296 A:middle
to debug and profile your Metal

00:02:15.296 --> 00:02:15.866 A:middle
workloads.

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:19.436 A:middle
And this year, we have some

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.916 A:middle
great additions to Metal frame

00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:22.196 A:middle
debugger.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.266 A:middle
With the dependency viewer, now

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.756 A:middle
you get visibility into how your

00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:28.926 A:middle
encoders are working together

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:31.026 A:middle
and connected through the use of

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.096 A:middle
resources.

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.076 A:middle
It's a great tool to navigate

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:36.336 A:middle
your workload and just

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:37.296 A:middle
understand how your [inaudible]

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:40.136 A:middle
are working together to create

00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:42.356 A:middle
that frame.

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:44.536 A:middle
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., we have

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:45.876 A:middle
Metal Game Performance

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:47.846 A:middle
Optimization talk, and part of

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:48.966 A:middle
it, we will be covering the

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:49.656 A:middle
dependency viewer.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:53.126 A:middle
But today I will be focusing on

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.806 A:middle
geometry viewer, shader

00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:57.486 A:middle
debugger, and enhanced shaded

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:57.936 A:middle
profiler.

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
And I will be showing you
