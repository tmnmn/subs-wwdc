00:21:59.196 --> 00:22:00.946 A:middle
in fragment shaders, I would

00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:02.916 A:middle
like to invite Xavier back to

00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:03.366 A:middle
the stage.

00:22:03.746 --> 00:22:04.136 A:middle
Xavier?

00:22:05.516 --> 00:22:08.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:09.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Alp.

00:22:10.136 --> 00:22:11.486 A:middle
After fixing our geometric

00:22:11.486 --> 00:22:13.086 A:middle
problems in the first demo, I

00:22:13.316 --> 00:22:15.096 A:middle
added highlights as a process

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:15.606 A:middle
and effect.

00:22:16.176 --> 00:22:17.376 A:middle
But the results were not as

00:22:17.376 --> 00:22:17.986 A:middle
suspected.

00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:19.936 A:middle
So I took a frame capture to

00:22:19.936 --> 00:22:20.706 A:middle
debug the issue.

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:27.506 A:middle
It was here in the [inaudible]

00:22:27.506 --> 00:22:30.016 A:middle
view, we can see that our

00:22:30.096 --> 00:22:31.356 A:middle
highlights are actually

00:22:31.356 --> 00:22:33.076 A:middle
generating dark areas in the

00:22:33.076 --> 00:22:33.886 A:middle
bottom parts.

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:36.246 A:middle
So let's use the Shader Debugger

00:22:36.346 --> 00:22:37.526 A:middle
to debug and fix this issue.

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:40.746 A:middle
By not pressing, I'm bringing up

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:42.796 A:middle
the pixel inspector, which

00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.246 A:middle
allows you to select the pixel

00:22:44.246 --> 00:22:45.096 A:middle
that you want to debug.

00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:47.736 A:middle
So here, we are going to select

00:22:47.736 --> 00:22:49.576 A:middle
one of the pixels, for example

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:51.446 A:middle
this one, and to start the

00:22:51.446 --> 00:22:52.876 A:middle
Shader Debugger, you have to

00:22:52.876 --> 00:22:54.636 A:middle
click the debug button here on

00:22:54.636 --> 00:22:55.566 A:middle
the bottom right corner.

00:22:58.216 --> 00:22:59.556 A:middle
And now, we are debugging the

00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
frame and shader.
