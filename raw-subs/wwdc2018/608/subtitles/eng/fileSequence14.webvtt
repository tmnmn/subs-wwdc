00:13:58.166 --> 00:14:03.466 A:middle
button, here in the debug bar.

00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:05.696 A:middle
Reloading the shaders will run

00:14:05.756 --> 00:14:06.976 A:middle
your full [inaudible] using the

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.566 A:middle
new shaders, so that you can

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:10.096 A:middle
check the results right away.

00:14:11.356 --> 00:14:14.236 A:middle
And as we can see here now our

00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:15.916 A:middle
water surface is smooth.

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:18.876 A:middle
But let's check it in action,

00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:20.686 A:middle
just by clicking on the continue

00:14:20.686 --> 00:14:27.706 A:middle
button here in the debug bar.

00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:28.656 A:middle
And, as we can see [applause

00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:31.016 A:middle
begins] now our water simulation

00:14:31.096 --> 00:14:31.826 A:middle
is correct.

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.306 A:middle
In this ex-- in this demo, we

00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:37.896 A:middle
have seen how to take a frame

00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:39.846 A:middle
cocktail, how to use the new

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:41.606 A:middle
geometry viewer to find broken

00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:43.506 A:middle
vertices, and how to use the new

00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:45.636 A:middle
Shader Debugger to debug and fix

00:14:45.636 --> 00:14:46.696 A:middle
your vertex shaders.

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:47.976 A:middle
Thank you, and back to Alp.

00:14:48.516 --> 00:14:57.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:57.516 --> 00:14:58.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, huh?

00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.426 A:middle
Thank you, Xavier.
