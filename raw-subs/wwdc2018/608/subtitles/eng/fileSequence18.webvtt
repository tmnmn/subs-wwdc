00:18:00.866 --> 00:18:03.156 A:middle
This also provides a unique

00:18:03.156 --> 00:18:04.486 A:middle
stepping experience where you

00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:06.656 A:middle
can just use your cursor keys to

00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:08.326 A:middle
step through your code.

00:18:09.206 --> 00:18:10.776 A:middle
Functions are groups in the

00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:12.306 A:middle
navigator, so that you can just

00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:17.166 A:middle
expand them and step into them.

00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:18.676 A:middle
This also enables backward

00:18:18.746 --> 00:18:21.046 A:middle
debugging, which is a really

00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:22.976 A:middle
powerful way of debugging your

00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:23.526 A:middle
shaders.

00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:25.326 A:middle
Just find the variable that has

00:18:25.326 --> 00:18:27.476 A:middle
the wrong value, and just work

00:18:27.476 --> 00:18:29.266 A:middle
your way backward to see where

00:18:29.336 --> 00:18:33.396 A:middle
it got wrong, and why.

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:35.026 A:middle
Also you can use the filtering.

00:18:35.946 --> 00:18:37.686 A:middle
Filtering is a great way to

00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:41.576 A:middle
focus, and you can filter for

00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:42.716 A:middle
anything you are interested in

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:43.506 A:middle
your shader code.

00:18:44.396 --> 00:18:46.336 A:middle
Filter will be matching with

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:48.876 A:middle
function calls, variables,

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:50.046 A:middle
resources.

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:53.676 A:middle
And your shader code might span

00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:55.936 A:middle
across many different files, but

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:58.046 A:middle
if you use filter, it will only

00:18:58.046 --> 00:18:59.686 A:middle
match with what your shader

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:01.996 A:middle
executed, so it's a really great
