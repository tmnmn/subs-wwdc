00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:00.676 A:middle
algorithm or when I just get

00:30:00.676 --> 00:30:02.166 A:middle
through this control flow, and

00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:04.046 A:middle
when I understand whether you

00:30:05.676 --> 00:30:06.196 A:middle
can.

00:30:06.196 --> 00:30:08.906 A:middle
So Shader Profiler helps you a

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.596 A:middle
lot trying to optimize your

00:30:10.596 --> 00:30:13.336 A:middle
shaders, but we made this even

00:30:13.336 --> 00:30:17.330 A:middle
better for A11.

00:30:18.096 --> 00:30:19.286 A:middle
Now, A11 [inaudible] being the

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:21.366 A:middle
completely [inaudible] design

00:30:21.366 --> 00:30:23.486 A:middle
GPU, now we have hardware

00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:24.826 A:middle
support to give you even more

00:30:24.826 --> 00:30:26.366 A:middle
insight in what your shaders are

00:30:27.696 --> 00:30:27.816 A:middle
doing.

00:30:28.046 --> 00:30:30.126 A:middle
Now with A11, you get this

00:30:30.126 --> 00:30:32.596 A:middle
chart, per line, showing you the

00:30:32.686 --> 00:30:34.196 A:middle
cost breakdown of the executed

00:30:34.196 --> 00:30:34.496 A:middle
line.

00:30:35.096 --> 00:30:37.106 A:middle
So Shader consists different

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:39.706 A:middle
execution units, and if you are

00:30:39.706 --> 00:30:41.526 A:middle
using one of them heavily, you

00:30:41.526 --> 00:30:42.716 A:middle
might be bottlenecked by that.

00:30:43.936 --> 00:30:46.096 A:middle
So seeing ALU and memory

00:30:46.096 --> 00:30:48.456 A:middle
breakdown gives you visibility

00:30:48.926 --> 00:30:50.776 A:middle
into like time spent in

00:30:50.776 --> 00:30:51.996 A:middle
different execution units.

00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:55.196 A:middle
We did a lot of work for how

00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:56.516 A:middle
precision instructions to be

00:30:56.516 --> 00:30:57.876 A:middle
much more efficient in A11.

00:30:58.366 --> 00:31:00.136 A:middle
So using health, overflows,
