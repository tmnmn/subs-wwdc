00:36:58.296 --> 00:37:00.126 A:middle
your shader sources alongside

00:37:00.126 --> 00:37:00.526 A:middle
your app.

00:37:00.946 --> 00:37:02.256 A:middle
All right.

00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:06.226 A:middle
Let's recap what we talked about

00:37:07.596 --> 00:37:07.726 A:middle
today.

00:37:07.916 --> 00:37:09.056 A:middle
We started with geometric

00:37:09.056 --> 00:37:11.866 A:middle
viewer, providing you one place

00:37:11.866 --> 00:37:13.686 A:middle
to investigate all your vertex

00:37:13.686 --> 00:37:16.266 A:middle
related issues, and debugging

00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:18.376 A:middle
visual problems, please remember

00:37:18.376 --> 00:37:19.646 A:middle
to check with geometric viewer

00:37:19.646 --> 00:37:21.276 A:middle
first, and make sure that your

00:37:21.276 --> 00:37:23.216 A:middle
geometry is right before moving

00:37:23.216 --> 00:37:24.736 A:middle
on to debugging your shaders.

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.906 A:middle
And then we have seen shader

00:37:27.906 --> 00:37:30.096 A:middle
debuggers, powerful tools to

00:37:30.096 --> 00:37:31.986 A:middle
debug all your Metal shaders.

00:37:32.656 --> 00:37:33.816 A:middle
Great for fixing bugs,

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:36.546 A:middle
understanding your shaders, and

00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:37.876 A:middle
just developing your shaders.

00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:40.956 A:middle
And within [inaudible] profiler,

00:37:41.486 --> 00:37:43.286 A:middle
now you get even more visibility

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:45.706 A:middle
into what your GPU is doing with

00:37:45.706 --> 00:37:48.746 A:middle
the power of A11 bionic chip.

00:37:49.696 --> 00:37:51.786 A:middle
For more information, please

00:37:51.926 --> 00:37:52.526 A:middle
check the link.

00:37:53.606 --> 00:37:55.486 A:middle
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., we have

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:57.326 A:middle
a great talk on Metal game

00:37:57.326 --> 00:37:59.226 A:middle
performance optimization, where

00:37:59.226 --> 00:38:00.976 A:middle
we will be talking about common
