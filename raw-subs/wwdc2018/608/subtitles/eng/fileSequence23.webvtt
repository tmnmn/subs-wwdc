00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:00.296 A:middle
frame and shader.

00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:07.656 A:middle
As we can see here, the

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:09.186 A:middle
highlights are generated in

00:23:09.186 --> 00:23:10.416 A:middle
three different steps.

00:23:10.976 --> 00:23:12.346 A:middle
So let's use the detailed views

00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:13.646 A:middle
to quickly understand what is

00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:14.126 A:middle
happening.

00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:16.466 A:middle
Let's start at the beginning on

00:23:16.466 --> 00:23:17.416 A:middle
this close first one.

00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:21.676 A:middle
As we can see here, we are just

00:23:21.676 --> 00:23:23.336 A:middle
sampling from our original

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:25.576 A:middle
color, and this looks correct.

00:23:25.986 --> 00:23:29.056 A:middle
So let's see what is next.

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:30.596 A:middle
Here, we are accumulating

00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:31.716 A:middle
highlights in one of the

00:23:31.716 --> 00:23:33.696 A:middle
directions, so let's take the

00:23:33.696 --> 00:23:35.246 A:middle
results by opening the detailed

00:23:35.246 --> 00:23:35.436 A:middle
view.

00:23:35.926 --> 00:23:39.246 A:middle
And as we can see here in the

00:23:39.246 --> 00:23:41.116 A:middle
detailed view, there is already

00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:42.776 A:middle
dark area in the bottom part,

00:23:42.896 --> 00:23:45.556 A:middle
right here, so then the problem

00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:46.696 A:middle
must be in how we are

00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:48.066 A:middle
accumulating those highlights.

00:23:48.726 --> 00:23:51.016 A:middle
As you can see, detailed views

00:23:51.016 --> 00:23:52.136 A:middle
are a powerful tool to

00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:53.816 A:middle
understand your shader without

00:23:53.816 --> 00:23:55.186 A:middle
even having to read the code.

00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:58.376 A:middle
So let's use the Debug Navigator

00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:00.056 A:middle
to go to that first one and
