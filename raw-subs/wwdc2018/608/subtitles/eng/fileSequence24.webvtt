00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:00.056 A:middle
to go to that first one and

00:24:00.056 --> 00:24:01.396 A:middle
investigate what is happening.

00:24:01.866 --> 00:24:06.386 A:middle
As we can see here, this

00:24:06.386 --> 00:24:08.106 A:middle
function is mainly a loop that

00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:09.316 A:middle
iterates a few times,

00:24:09.456 --> 00:24:11.256 A:middle
accumulating samples from

00:24:13.036 --> 00:24:13.326 A:middle
[inaudible] map.

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:14.946 A:middle
Loops are highlighted just in

00:24:14.946 --> 00:24:16.976 A:middle
the Shader Debugger, which means

00:24:16.976 --> 00:24:18.666 A:middle
that you can navigate through

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:20.426 A:middle
your iterations using the Debug

00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:22.396 A:middle
Navigator, and you will get,

00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:24.086 A:middle
alongside with your source code,

00:24:24.316 --> 00:24:25.766 A:middle
the value of the variables at

00:24:25.766 --> 00:24:27.266 A:middle
each one of the iterations.

00:24:27.796 --> 00:24:31.596 A:middle
If we focus here, we can see

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:32.786 A:middle
that as I navigate through the

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:34.606 A:middle
different iterations, the values

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:35.046 A:middle
change.

00:24:37.016 --> 00:24:39.656 A:middle
But what is really powerful is

00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:40.956 A:middle
combining this with detailed

00:24:40.956 --> 00:24:41.466 A:middle
views.

00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:44.196 A:middle
So here, we are going to bring

00:24:44.196 --> 00:24:45.566 A:middle
up the detailed view for final

00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:47.226 A:middle
color, that this is where we are

00:24:47.226 --> 00:24:48.666 A:middle
accumulating our highlights.

00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:53.556 A:middle
And now let's iterate using the

00:24:53.556 --> 00:24:54.476 A:middle
Debug Navigator.

00:24:55.326 --> 00:24:57.906 A:middle
As we can see, as I iterate, we

00:24:58.056 --> 00:24:59.346 A:middle
are starting to accumulate

00:24:59.346 --> 00:25:00.946 A:middle
highlights in our final color.
