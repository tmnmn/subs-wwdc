00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.236 A:middle
And for compute, you will be

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.286 A:middle
using the controls to select the

00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:04.516 A:middle
thread you are interested in.

00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:07.166 A:middle
And then, just click the debug

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.906 A:middle
button, and that's it.

00:16:09.596 --> 00:16:10.556 A:middle
You are in the Shader Debugger.

00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:12.696 A:middle
And whilst you're in the Shader

00:16:12.696 --> 00:16:14.666 A:middle
Debugger, it is so easy to

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.006 A:middle
inspect any variable you are

00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:16.686 A:middle
interested in.

00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:18.706 A:middle
You just need to go to the

00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:19.936 A:middle
source line you have the

00:16:19.936 --> 00:16:21.716 A:middle
variable, and that is all you

00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:22.836 A:middle
have to do.

00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:24.256 A:middle
You don't need any break points,

00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:25.436 A:middle
you don't need to step through

00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:25.926 A:middle
your code.

00:16:26.566 --> 00:16:28.356 A:middle
The values of the modified

00:16:28.356 --> 00:16:30.376 A:middle
variables in the line are going

00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:31.716 A:middle
to be available on the side bar.

00:16:32.946 --> 00:16:34.406 A:middle
And as you have seen in the

00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:35.836 A:middle
demo, we highlight [inaudible]

00:16:35.956 --> 00:16:38.976 A:middle
and infinite values in there, so

00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:40.576 A:middle
that it's really easy to spot

00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:41.466 A:middle
common mistakes.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:43.806 A:middle
You can just use the button on

00:16:43.806 --> 00:16:45.826 A:middle
the side bar to enable the

00:16:45.826 --> 00:16:47.816 A:middle
detail views, and get full

00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:49.486 A:middle
details about your variables.

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:53.356 A:middle
This is pretty handy, especially

00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:54.696 A:middle
if you want to inspect the

00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:56.196 A:middle
complex [inaudible] and want to

00:16:56.196 --> 00:16:57.786 A:middle
dive into different components.

00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:02.136 A:middle
Or you can just hover on any
