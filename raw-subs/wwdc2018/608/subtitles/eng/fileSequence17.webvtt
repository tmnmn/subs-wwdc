00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:02.136 A:middle
Or you can just hover on any

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:03.346 A:middle
variable you have in your source

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:05.776 A:middle
code, and you will instantly see

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:07.316 A:middle
the value of the variable at

00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:07.866 A:middle
that point.

00:17:08.685 --> 00:17:11.256 A:middle
And this is partially useful if

00:17:11.526 --> 00:17:13.366 A:middle
you are sampling from a texture,

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:15.726 A:middle
like in this example, and you

00:17:15.726 --> 00:17:17.715 A:middle
want to quickly check whether

00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:20.506 A:middle
this is the right texture.

00:17:20.626 --> 00:17:23.016 A:middle
And just like in CPU debuggers,

00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:24.626 A:middle
you have access to your

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.796 A:middle
variables view, showing you all

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.876 A:middle
your variables in scope.

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:32.496 A:middle
So inspecting variables is a

00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:33.656 A:middle
core part of debugging your

00:17:33.656 --> 00:17:35.856 A:middle
shaders, but that is only half

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:36.396 A:middle
of the story.

00:17:37.096 --> 00:17:38.696 A:middle
You also want to know what is

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:40.376 A:middle
the order of your code getting

00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:40.996 A:middle
executed?

00:17:41.536 --> 00:17:42.896 A:middle
And Shader Debugger makes this

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:43.866 A:middle
really easy as well.

00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:46.876 A:middle
When you get into Shader

00:17:46.876 --> 00:17:48.356 A:middle
Debugger, in the Debug

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:50.386 A:middle
Navigator, you will see all your

00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:52.316 A:middle
source line execute by your

00:17:52.316 --> 00:17:53.546 A:middle
shader for your selected

00:17:53.546 --> 00:17:53.946 A:middle
threads.

00:17:55.906 --> 00:17:58.276 A:middle
And you can select any line you

00:17:58.276 --> 00:17:59.596 A:middle
want and directly navigate to

00:17:59.596 --> 00:17:59.856 A:middle
that.
