00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:00.736 A:middle
And that is the start of our

00:33:00.736 --> 00:33:01.536 A:middle
investigation.

00:33:04.256 --> 00:33:07.306 A:middle
So what we see here right now on

00:33:07.306 --> 00:33:08.716 A:middle
the right-hand side is a

00:33:08.716 --> 00:33:10.446 A:middle
percentage of time we are

00:33:10.446 --> 00:33:11.666 A:middle
spending inside of this

00:33:11.666 --> 00:33:14.196 A:middle
function, and further down the

00:33:14.196 --> 00:33:16.326 A:middle
percentage of time we spend in

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:17.846 A:middle
each file-- each line.

00:33:19.186 --> 00:33:20.916 A:middle
Be aware the Shader Profiler

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:23.386 A:middle
works on optimized code, so the

00:33:23.386 --> 00:33:24.786 A:middle
compiler can reorder the

00:33:24.786 --> 00:33:26.946 A:middle
instructions and there may be no

00:33:26.946 --> 00:33:28.416 A:middle
timing information for some

00:33:28.416 --> 00:33:28.786 A:middle
lines.

00:33:29.536 --> 00:33:32.366 A:middle
Next to the timing information,

00:33:32.866 --> 00:33:33.766 A:middle
we have the instruction

00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:34.386 A:middle
categories.

00:33:34.526 --> 00:33:37.346 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:39.626 A:middle
We can see that we spend time in

00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:41.986 A:middle
ALU doing math operations, we

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.346 A:middle
are reading from memory, from

00:33:43.346 --> 00:33:45.696 A:middle
textures, but what raises my

00:33:45.696 --> 00:33:46.986 A:middle
concern is the time we are

00:33:46.986 --> 00:33:48.536 A:middle
spending in synchronization,

00:33:48.936 --> 00:33:50.656 A:middle
specifically, waiting on memory

00:33:50.656 --> 00:33:50.966 A:middle
here.

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:53.316 A:middle
That means our GPU could not

00:33:53.316 --> 00:33:55.336 A:middle
read data fast enough, and it

00:33:55.336 --> 00:33:57.216 A:middle
could not hide this latency by

00:33:57.216 --> 00:33:58.866 A:middle
doing ALU work in other threads.
