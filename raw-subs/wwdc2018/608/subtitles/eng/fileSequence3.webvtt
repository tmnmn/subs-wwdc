00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:00.216 A:middle
And I will be showing you

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:02.086 A:middle
workloads that will help you in

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:04.066 A:middle
your day-to-day shaded elements.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:06.736 A:middle
So, let's start with the

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:07.336 A:middle
geometry viewer.

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:14.226 A:middle
Vertex Stage is the first stage

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.286 A:middle
of the graphics pipeline.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.126 A:middle
And when you get it wrong, it

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:19.526 A:middle
can mess up your entire scene.

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:22.416 A:middle
So it is important to rule out

00:03:22.926 --> 00:03:25.346 A:middle
some of the vertex issues before

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:26.656 A:middle
moving on to debugging your

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:27.216 A:middle
shaders.

00:03:27.756 --> 00:03:31.556 A:middle
In Vertex Stage, there are

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.446 A:middle
several things to check.

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:35.906 A:middle
Mainly, your vertex inputs, your

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:37.596 A:middle
indices, and your vertex

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
outputs.

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:41.256 A:middle
Last year, with Xcode 9, we

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.226 A:middle
introduced input attribute view

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:45.096 A:middle
where we can see all this data

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.166 A:middle
combined in a table view format.

00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:50.036 A:middle
But it is still hard to debug

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:54.006 A:middle
such visual data without really

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:55.356 A:middle
correlating back to 3D.

00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:58.966 A:middle
So that's why this year we

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.006 A:middle
combined all this data and
