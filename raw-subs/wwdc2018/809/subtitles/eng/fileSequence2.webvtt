button or entering a special

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:04.056 A:middle
mode to draw with Pencil.

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:07.706 A:middle
Pencil should make a mark the

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.925 A:middle
moment it touches the screen.

00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:13.766 A:middle
When I put Pencil down, I can go

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.086 A:middle
ahead and write my guess

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:15.876 A:middle
immediately.

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:21.456 A:middle
Pencil is familiar; it should

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.116 A:middle
behave consistently with what

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:24.396 A:middle
people using our app have come

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:25.546 A:middle
to expect.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:28.246 A:middle
This means that tapping controls

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:29.156 A:middle
should behave the same whether

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.376 A:middle
you touch them with Pencil or

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:31.216 A:middle
your finger.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:32.816 A:middle
Here, I can interact with the

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.846 A:middle
various setting sliders using

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:36.446 A:middle
Pencil just like I would with my

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:37.126 A:middle
finger.

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.156 A:middle
One thing we definitely never

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:41.006 A:middle
want to do is have controls that

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:41.676 A:middle
will have different

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.496 A:middle
consequences, or worse, do

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.326 A:middle
nothing when tapped with Pencil

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:46.336 A:middle
rather than a finger.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:48.406 A:middle
This would be very unpredictable

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:49.276 A:middle
and confusing.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.996 A:middle
Pencil has a number of sensors.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.726 A:middle
It can sense tilt, force, and

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:58.736 A:middle
orientation, and these sensors

00:02:58.736 --> 00:02:59.826 A:middle
can add layers of depth and

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:01.126 A:middle
expressivity to our
