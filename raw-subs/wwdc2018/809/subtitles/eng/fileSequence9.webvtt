00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:03.546 A:middle
over, and yet others might draw

00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:04.686 A:middle
something like an X mark.

00:09:06.986 --> 00:09:08.616 A:middle
Handwriting is really

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:10.406 A:middle
expressive; different people

00:09:10.406 --> 00:09:11.246 A:middle
will cross things out

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:11.756 A:middle
differently.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:13.816 A:middle
So, in this case, it's probably

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:14.646 A:middle
better not to ask people to

00:09:14.646 --> 00:09:15.556 A:middle
perform a specific mark they

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:16.366 A:middle
would have to remember.

00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:18.786 A:middle
In addition to being hard to

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:20.116 A:middle
remember, specific marks might

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:21.166 A:middle
have different meanings in

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:21.926 A:middle
different cultures.

00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:24.006 A:middle
For example, in the U.S., it's

00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:25.296 A:middle
pretty common to use a checkmark

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:25.926 A:middle
to mean correct.

00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:27.776 A:middle
In other countries, that might

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.756 A:middle
not mean anything or even mean

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:30.226 A:middle
incorrect.

00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:34.086 A:middle
So, what we do is we just let

00:09:34.086 --> 00:09:35.456 A:middle
people erase a cell by

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:36.796 A:middle
scribbling over it.

00:09:37.216 --> 00:09:39.436 A:middle
Whether they slash it out, draw

00:09:39.436 --> 00:09:42.056 A:middle
an X, scribble over it, draw a

00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:43.606 A:middle
straight line, it doesn't

00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:43.986 A:middle
matter.

00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:45.436 A:middle
All of it works and erases the

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:45.726 A:middle
cell.

00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:48.946 A:middle
Let's look at another two-step

00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:50.596 A:middle
interaction, getting a hint.

00:09:52.396 --> 00:09:54.336 A:middle
First, we'd have to tap the hint

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
button and then we tap the cell

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:57.136 A:middle
we want a hint for.

00:09:57.666 --> 00:09:59.176 A:middle
And this is another interaction

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:00.446 A:middle
that we can bring down to one
