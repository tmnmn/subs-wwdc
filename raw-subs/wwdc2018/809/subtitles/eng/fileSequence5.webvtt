00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:01.666 A:middle
What we shouldn't do is impose

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:03.096 A:middle
unnecessary constraints on

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:04.786 A:middle
input, like rejecting it if it

00:05:04.786 --> 00:05:06.136 A:middle
doesn't fit perfectly within the

00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:06.446 A:middle
cell.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.826 A:middle
So, what we're going to do here

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:10.736 A:middle
is assign the answer to the cell

00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:12.736 A:middle
it covers the most and we also

00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:14.576 A:middle
scale and move it to make it fit

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:15.926 A:middle
neatly into the cell, which is a

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.596 A:middle
nice little touch.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.986 A:middle
Now, an interesting question

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:21.666 A:middle
comes up.

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:23.736 A:middle
What should we do if the player

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:25.236 A:middle
starts drawing or writing

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:27.066 A:middle
outside of the main sudoku grid?

00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:29.586 A:middle
One thing we can try doing is

00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:31.716 A:middle
just nothing, but it doesn't

00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:32.576 A:middle
feel very good.

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.026 A:middle
It goes back to our earlier

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:35.736 A:middle
point about making a mark.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:37.626 A:middle
It breaks the impression of

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.266 A:middle
fluidity and it might even lead

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.616 A:middle
some people to think that their

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:42.036 A:middle
Pencil is impaired, or the

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:43.016 A:middle
battery is discharged.

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:46.816 A:middle
Something we can try is to show

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:48.766 A:middle
transient marks, marks that

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:50.516 A:middle
disappear shortly after they've

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.426 A:middle
been made, to communicate that

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:53.956 A:middle
everything is working fine, just

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:55.376 A:middle
the margins don't do anything

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:55.796 A:middle
special.

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:59.776 A:middle
Another option we can try is to

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.876 A:middle
just let people draw and
