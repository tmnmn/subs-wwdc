00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:02.676 A:middle
seven properties of Pencil that,

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:04.316 A:middle
when implemented, will add

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.006 A:middle
entire new dimensions to your

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:06.326 A:middle
app.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.426 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:10.056 A:middle
add Pencil interactions to an

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.306 A:middle
existing app.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:12.896 A:middle
So, here's my app.

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:14.296 A:middle
It's a fairly straightforward

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:15.036 A:middle
sudoku game.

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:16.586 A:middle
The puzzle screen shows the

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:17.756 A:middle
current puzzle we're solving.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:19.716 A:middle
Tapping a cell brings up the

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.306 A:middle
keyboard where the player can

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:22.686 A:middle
enter a number, and there are a

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.266 A:middle
number of buttons for showing or

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.566 A:middle
hiding the timer, depending on

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.406 A:middle
how competitive you are, for

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:29.806 A:middle
getting a hint, and for changing

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:30.746 A:middle
various settings about the

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:31.306 A:middle
current game.

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.736 A:middle
So, even though this is not a

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.416 A:middle
drawing app, doesn't it seem

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:36.376 A:middle
perfect for Pencil?

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:37.806 A:middle
Let's make it happen.

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:41.896 A:middle
And the first thing we're going

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.946 A:middle
to look at is that Pencil makes

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:44.506 A:middle
marks.

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:46.976 A:middle
I don't know about you, but if I

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:49.046 A:middle
pick up a pen and I try to write

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:50.396 A:middle
with it and it doesn't write, I

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:51.346 A:middle
toss it out.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.526 A:middle
We worked really hard on Apple

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:55.186 A:middle
Pencil and we don't want people

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.386 A:middle
tossing out their Apple Pencil.

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:59.696 A:middle
So, don't require tapping a

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:02.106 A:middle
button or entering a special
