first thing we're going](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=98) [to look at is that Pencil

should](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=139) [behave consistently with what](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=141) [people using our app have come](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=143) [to expect.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=144) [This means that tapping controls](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=146) [should behave the same

never](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=157) [want to do is have controls that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=159) [will have different](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=161)

Pencil](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=163) [rather than a finger.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=165) [This would be very unpredictable](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=166) [and confusing.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=168) [Pencil has a number of sensors.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=172) [It can sense tilt, force, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=174) [orientation, and these sensors](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=176) [can add layers of depth and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=178) [expressivity to

[interactions, but there are a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=181) [few missteps to avoid.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=182) [A good way to use the sensors is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=185) [to make marks more expressive.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=186) [For example, the continuous](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=187) [variation of pressure and tilt](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=189) [can modulate the thickness of a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=191) [stroke.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=192) [Or the orientation to affect the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=193) [width of a marker.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=195) [We don't want to use sensors to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=197) [affect things not directly](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=199) [related to Pencil input.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=201) [For example, here, depending on](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=202) [how hard we press, we get a new](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=204) [puzzle of varying difficulty.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=205) [That's just a confusing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=207) [behavior.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=208) [Sensors should affect the kind](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=209) [of marks that Pencil makes, not](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=211) [things disconnected from it.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=213) [Another way to handle sensor](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=217) [data is discretely.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=219) [For instance, to modify the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=220) [input based on the pressure](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=221) [exerted.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=222) [So, an idea for a game here is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=224) [to let people pencil in a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=225)

write.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=229) [Writing lightly lets you put in](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=230) [a guess in lighter ink, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=231) [writing with more pressure lets](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=233) [you commit that answer in

sensor](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=237) [We can think about a sensor](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=237) [reading such as pressor as a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=240) [continuum and treat it as such](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=242) [to modulate a quality of a mark.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=244) [We can also split that continuum](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=248) [binarily, as we just did

case, we'll want to make](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=253) [sure to give clear feedback as](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=254) [to which side of the split we're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=255) [on.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=257) [We definitely don't want to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/809/?time=259)
