00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.876 A:middle
just let people draw and

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:02.456 A:middle
annotate in the margins just for

00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:02.826 A:middle
fun.

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:04.446 A:middle
And this could be particularly

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:05.806 A:middle
great if later we add

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:06.956 A:middle
multiplayer to our game.

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:09.616 A:middle
Now, there is no right or wrong

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:10.236 A:middle
answer here.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.336 A:middle
It is up to you and what you

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:14.326 A:middle
want your app to be; but doing

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:15.866 A:middle
something is always better than

00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:17.546 A:middle
doing nothing, even if that

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:19.016 A:middle
something is just to communicate

00:06:19.016 --> 00:06:20.336 A:middle
that Pencil is working.

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:24.666 A:middle
If you're not drawing with

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:26.266 A:middle
Pencil, you're writing.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.566 A:middle
And because you're writing on an

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.226 A:middle
iPad and not a piece of paper,

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:31.836 A:middle
we have to ask ourselves

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.176 A:middle
questions about whether we want

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:34.776 A:middle
to process the input further.

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:37.666 A:middle
For the case of our game, should

00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:38.726 A:middle
we convert handwriting to

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:42.356 A:middle
digital or should we keep it

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.896 A:middle
analog as it is?

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:46.766 A:middle
One reason to convert it to

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.646 A:middle
digital is to be consistent with

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:49.406 A:middle
keyboard input.

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:51.716 A:middle
And one reason to keep it analog

00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:53.216 A:middle
is that it's fun and personal.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.786 A:middle
Again, here there are no right

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:56.636 A:middle
or wrong answers.

00:06:57.026 --> 00:06:58.226 A:middle
It will depend on your specific

00:06:58.226 --> 00:06:58.996 A:middle
circumstances.

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:00.486 A:middle
You do want to keep it
