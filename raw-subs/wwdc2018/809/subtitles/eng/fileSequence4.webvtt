00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:00.746 A:middle
We can think about a sensor

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:02.536 A:middle
reading such as pressor as a

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:04.606 A:middle
continuum and treat it as such

00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.526 A:middle
to modulate a quality of a mark.

00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:09.646 A:middle
We can also split that continuum

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.246 A:middle
binarily, as we just did for

00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:12.326 A:middle
this pencil-in feature.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.206 A:middle
In this case, we'll want to make

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:15.866 A:middle
sure to give clear feedback as

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:17.096 A:middle
to which side of the split we're

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:17.296 A:middle
on.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.685 A:middle
We definitely don't want to

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:22.026 A:middle
break that continuum into more

00:04:22.026 --> 00:04:23.586 A:middle
than two discrete parts though,

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:25.236 A:middle
as it would become very hard to

00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:26.176 A:middle
differentiate.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:27.816 A:middle
People can tell the difference

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:29.326 A:middle
between writing soft or writing

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:30.886 A:middle
hard, but they can't tell the

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:33.096 A:middle
difference between 5 or 8 or 15

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:34.146 A:middle
different levels of pressure.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.486 A:middle
Handwriting is tremendously

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:42.106 A:middle
expressive, and as a result, so

00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:43.216 A:middle
is Pencil input.

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:45.626 A:middle
As we get our game for people to

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:47.966 A:middle
try, we notice that people will

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.276 A:middle
often write slightly outside of

00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:51.376 A:middle
the boundaries of a cell and

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:52.536 A:middle
this is a totally normal side

00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:54.406 A:middle
effect of handwriting being so

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:56.226 A:middle
personal and freeform, but it

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:57.466 A:middle
means we need to be flexible

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.186 A:middle
with how we handle input.
