00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:03.546 A:middle
And, finally, Pencil is really

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:04.636 A:middle
great when it provides

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:05.366 A:middle
shortcuts.

00:08:05.976 --> 00:08:07.076 A:middle
That is, letting people do

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:08.796 A:middle
things faster by drawing and

00:08:08.796 --> 00:08:10.326 A:middle
writing rather than tapping on

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:10.766 A:middle
the screen.

00:08:11.276 --> 00:08:13.686 A:middle
So, how do we erase a cell in

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:14.096 A:middle
our game?

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:16.226 A:middle
It's a two-step process.

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:18.896 A:middle
The first step is we tap the

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:20.936 A:middle
cell we want to erase, and the

00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:22.346 A:middle
second step is we press the

00:08:22.346 --> 00:08:23.056 A:middle
backspace key.

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:25.476 A:middle
So, can we turn this two-step

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:27.316 A:middle
interaction into a one-step

00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:28.576 A:middle
interaction with Pencil?

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.176 A:middle
Something that would feel pretty

00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:32.765 A:middle
natural is letting people cross

00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:35.006 A:middle
out their answer, so let's give

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:35.556 A:middle
that a try.

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:41.135 A:middle
Seems to work pretty well.

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.516 A:middle
But, as I give my game for

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:46.076 A:middle
people to try, I notice

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:46.976 A:middle
something interesting when they

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.606 A:middle
try to erase a cell.

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:52.456 A:middle
Some people will strike it

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:56.306 A:middle
through, others will scribble it
