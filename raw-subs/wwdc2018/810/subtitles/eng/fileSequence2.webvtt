00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.156 A:middle
making exceptional maps, but

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:02.376 A:middle
here's an excellent place to

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:04.556 A:middle
start.

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:07.896 A:middle
First, know your audience and

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:08.626 A:middle
what they need.

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.736 A:middle
Second, carefully choose your

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.676 A:middle
map elements and leave out the

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.626 A:middle
things that aren't necessary.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.916 A:middle
And third, focus on hierarchy so

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.796 A:middle
that it's immediately clear what

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:21.916 A:middle
is most important.

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.016 A:middle
Why know your audience?

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.946 A:middle
Well, you need to know what your

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.446 A:middle
users are trying to do.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:30.226 A:middle
Because this knowledge will

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:31.806 A:middle
shape every part of your map,

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:34.316 A:middle
from the features you include to

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:35.326 A:middle
your design decisions.

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:37.566 A:middle
And the success of your map

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:38.886 A:middle
really depends on its

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:40.576 A:middle
responsiveness to those user

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:41.036 A:middle
goals.

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:43.456 A:middle
Keep in mind that you sometimes

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:44.786 A:middle
have more than one group of

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:46.636 A:middle
users with different needs.

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.186 A:middle
For instance, if you're making a

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:51.766 A:middle
navigation map, perhaps you'll

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.526 A:middle
have some users traveling by

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:57.816 A:middle
bike, others on transit, and the

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:58.636 A:middle
rest by boat.

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
So, these different modes of
