[ Music ]

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:22.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Maps are everywhere.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.016 A:middle
People have been recording

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.286 A:middle
information about the world

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:27.436 A:middle
around them as far as we can

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:27.766 A:middle
tell.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.916 A:middle
And we use maps for a wide

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:30.976 A:middle
variety of purposes.

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:34.836 A:middle
Like finding a new hiking trail

00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:38.076 A:middle
or keeping tabs on the progress

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.086 A:middle
of our dinner or dessert order.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.706 A:middle
We can even use maps to orient

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:45.726 A:middle
ourselves in imaginary places,

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:47.416 A:middle
tracking our movement through

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.626 A:middle
levels of a game, or a

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.596 A:middle
character's position on a

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.866 A:middle
fictional battlefield.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.756 A:middle
Mapping technologies continue to

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.356 A:middle
evolve, but the essential

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.246 A:middle
characteristics of maps remain

00:00:59.246 --> 00:00:59.796 A:middle
the same.
