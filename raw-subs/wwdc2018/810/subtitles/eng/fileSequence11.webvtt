00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:00.426 A:middle
elements.

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:02.846 A:middle
We need to talk about the

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:03.436 A:middle
photos.

00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:05.786 A:middle
They're cute, but I don't really

00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:06.616 A:middle
think that they're the best

00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:07.406 A:middle
choice.

00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:08.856 A:middle
The colors are kind of

00:11:08.856 --> 00:11:10.766 A:middle
distracting and there's a lot of

00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:11.386 A:middle
detail.

00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:14.476 A:middle
Remember, maps are an abstracted

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:16.156 A:middle
representation of a place.

00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:18.246 A:middle
We don't have to be literal.

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.606 A:middle
We often use simple symbols in

00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:20.896 A:middle
maps.

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:22.946 A:middle
So, let's try a drawing of a

00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:23.686 A:middle
mouse instead.

00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:27.036 A:middle
I think this is better in line

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:28.246 A:middle
with our fun and simple

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:28.866 A:middle
aesthetic.

00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:30.486 A:middle
But now we need to make sure

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:31.506 A:middle
that the other symbols match

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:32.016 A:middle
too.

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:37.096 A:middle
So, we'll switch up our dogs,

00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:39.066 A:middle
and now the fountains.

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:43.956 A:middle
Notice that we lost some detail

00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:44.266 A:middle
here.

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:46.466 A:middle
When we were showing the

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:48.276 A:middle
fountains as photos, they were

00:11:48.276 --> 00:11:49.346 A:middle
different sizes.

00:11:49.656 --> 00:11:51.366 A:middle
But, this is a pretty simple

00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:51.906 A:middle
game.

00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:53.386 A:middle
So, our fountains don't deal

00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:54.816 A:middle
different amounts of damage.

00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:56.716 A:middle
We're simplifying the map here

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.336 A:middle
by having the symbols match.

00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:00.776 A:middle
Also, if we had sized their
