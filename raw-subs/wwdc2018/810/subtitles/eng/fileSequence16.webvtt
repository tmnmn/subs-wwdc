00:15:58.786 --> 00:16:00.446 A:middle
map to other people and get

00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:01.446 A:middle
their feedback too.

00:16:02.116 --> 00:16:03.826 A:middle
Maybe your friends, family, and

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:05.296 A:middle
colleagues will agree that your

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.206 A:middle
map is nailing all those goals.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.866 A:middle
Maybe they'll feel like it's

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:09.866 A:middle
still work in progress.

00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:12.046 A:middle
If that's the case, keep

00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:13.226 A:middle
iterating until you feel

00:16:13.226 --> 00:16:14.006 A:middle
satisfied.

00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:15.986 A:middle
Are you ready to see this map in

00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:16.446 A:middle
action?

00:16:27.416 --> 00:16:27.976 A:middle
All right.

[ Applause ]

00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:35.746 A:middle
So, I hope this exercise has

00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:37.406 A:middle
helped inspire you for the next

00:16:37.556 --> 00:16:38.916 A:middle
map that you get to make.

00:16:40.296 --> 00:16:41.886 A:middle
Remember to think carefully

00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:44.826 A:middle
about knowing your audience,

00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:46.476 A:middle
leaving out the things that they

00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:48.716 A:middle
don't really need, and making it

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.396 A:middle
clear with visual hierarchy,

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:51.506 A:middle
what matters most.
