00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.856 A:middle
And the pet store where she can

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:04.666 A:middle
regain her health.

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:06.396 A:middle
Okay so, this is starting to

00:06:06.396 --> 00:06:07.206 A:middle
come together.

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:08.966 A:middle
Remember we're going to restyle

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.586 A:middle
later on, but this map looks

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:13.136 A:middle
kind of bare in places, and

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:14.716 A:middle
doesn't give us all the

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.066 A:middle
information that we might really

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:16.296 A:middle
want.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
So, we can all think of elements

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.386 A:middle
that we've seen in other maps.

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:22.786 A:middle
Let's add some of them and then

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:24.006 A:middle
decide whether or not they

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:25.896 A:middle
really belong in this particular

00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:26.086 A:middle
map.

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:29.056 A:middle
We could, for example, include

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.246 A:middle
the rest of the building

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:31.026 A:middle
footprints.

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:33.836 A:middle
Maybe some polygons for those

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:34.566 A:middle
parks.

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:36.836 A:middle
Perhaps a title.

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:40.066 A:middle
Possibly even a legend.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.286 A:middle
Lots of maps have a compass rose

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:43.846 A:middle
and a scale bar.

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:45.766 A:middle
Oh, right, and since this map is

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:47.076 A:middle
doubling as a gameboard, we'll

00:06:47.076 --> 00:06:49.086 A:middle
need a few other elements too.

00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:51.646 A:middle
Like a health indicator, a mouse

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:52.036 A:middle
counter.

00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:53.626 A:middle
How can we know if we're

00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:54.826 A:middle
successful otherwise.

00:06:54.856 --> 00:06:55.916 A:middle
And a timer.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.176 A:middle
This game doesn't last forever.
