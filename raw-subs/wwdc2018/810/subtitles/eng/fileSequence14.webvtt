00:13:59.496 --> 00:14:01.276 A:middle
Pantera can be purple, like her

00:14:01.276 --> 00:14:01.616 A:middle
house.

00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:04.436 A:middle
And let's make the dogs brown.

00:14:05.016 --> 00:14:08.216 A:middle
Now the fountains look a little

00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:09.126 A:middle
bit out of place.

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:10.406 A:middle
We should color them too.

00:14:10.826 --> 00:14:12.296 A:middle
We'll go for blue, they're water

00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:12.956 A:middle
after all.

00:14:15.296 --> 00:14:18.596 A:middle
Okay. So, I think we're really

00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:19.426 A:middle
getting close.

00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:21.276 A:middle
But this isn't quite it yet.

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:23.536 A:middle
I have some concerns about the

00:14:23.536 --> 00:14:24.026 A:middle
dogs.

00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:25.756 A:middle
We don't want them to actually

00:14:25.756 --> 00:14:27.306 A:middle
looks scary, of course.

00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:28.456 A:middle
Remember, our game is supposed

00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:29.996 A:middle
to be fun and lighthearted.

00:14:30.296 --> 00:14:31.456 A:middle
But they almost look too

00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:31.986 A:middle
friendly.

00:14:32.216 --> 00:14:33.356 A:middle
And we want to make it clear

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:34.956 A:middle
that players need to avoid them.

00:14:35.606 --> 00:14:39.176 A:middle
So, let's try adding some

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:41.926 A:middle
eyebrows.

00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:44.356 A:middle
Okay. With the addition of these

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:46.546 A:middle
dog eyebrows, I think we've got

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:47.436 A:middle
something pretty good.

00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:50.366 A:middle
Happens all the time.

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.936 A:middle
So, let's take a look back at

00:14:52.936 --> 00:14:53.496 A:middle
our progress.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.156 A:middle
On purpose this time.

00:14:57.456 --> 00:14:59.456 A:middle
We started here with all the

00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:01.336 A:middle
elements we knew we'd need.
