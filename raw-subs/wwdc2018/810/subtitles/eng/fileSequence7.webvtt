00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:01.406 A:middle
All right.

00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:05.126 A:middle
But wait. It's easy for maps to

00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:05.936 A:middle
get overloaded.

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:08.016 A:middle
And this is a great example of

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.036 A:middle
that exact problem.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.086 A:middle
Way too much is happening here.

00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:15.746 A:middle
Our map is chaotic and it's not

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:17.466 A:middle
necessarily reflective of our

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.606 A:middle
intent, which was to create

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.756 A:middle
something that's cute, fun to

00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:22.506 A:middle
look at, and easy to understand.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.646 A:middle
And, thinking back to the

00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:26.556 A:middle
purpose of this map, we're

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:27.966 A:middle
losing sight of the features

00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:29.276 A:middle
that are most important to

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:31.286 A:middle
users, mice, sidewalks, and

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:31.856 A:middle
hazards.

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:33.656 A:middle
So, let's fix this.

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:38.146 A:middle
It's time to think seriously

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:39.366 A:middle
about leaving things out.

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:41.556 A:middle
Because when it comes to maps,

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.266 A:middle
knowing what to omit is just as

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.616 A:middle
important as knowing what to

00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:46.096 A:middle
include.

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:48.006 A:middle
We're going to remove some of

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:49.556 A:middle
the elements that aren't really

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:51.376 A:middle
necessary for this particular

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:52.226 A:middle
map.

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:56.366 A:middle
So, as we know the map exists

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:57.266 A:middle
within our game.

00:07:57.816 --> 00:07:59.476 A:middle
So, don't really need a title

00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:01.156 A:middle
here though of course we'd want
