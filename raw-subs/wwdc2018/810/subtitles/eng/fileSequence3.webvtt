00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.516 A:middle
So, these different modes of

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:02.316 A:middle
transportation will mean that

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.996 A:middle
your users are concerned about

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:04.846 A:middle
different things.

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:07.306 A:middle
Grade matters a lot to cyclists,

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:09.626 A:middle
so they might need contour lines

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:10.916 A:middle
or other indications about

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:11.656 A:middle
topography.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:14.146 A:middle
Train passengers are especially

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:15.786 A:middle
likely to want transit stations

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:17.386 A:middle
represented very clearly.

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:20.196 A:middle
And those arriving by boat care

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:21.976 A:middle
much more about dock amenities

00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:23.346 A:middle
and bathymetry than others.

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.576 A:middle
Keeping these types of needs in

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.186 A:middle
mind helps you make a more

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:27.776 A:middle
useful map.

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.896 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.856 A:middle
We're going to build a map for a

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:35.346 A:middle
fictional game about my cat.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:37.496 A:middle
It's is called Pantera's Big

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.986 A:middle
Adventure and in it, players

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.746 A:middle
travel Pac-Man style around the

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:43.316 A:middle
neighborhood picking up as many

00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:45.086 A:middle
catnip mice as they can before

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.306 A:middle
it's time to go home for dinner.

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:48.876 A:middle
We'll build out the game map and

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:50.866 A:middle
use this exercise to illustrate

00:03:50.866 --> 00:03:52.186 A:middle
those three tips.

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:54.746 A:middle
This map is a bit unusual for a

00:03:54.826 --> 00:03:55.676 A:middle
few reasons.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.506 A:middle
It will also function as a

00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:59.356 A:middle
gameboard, it's showing an

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.726 A:middle
imaginary place, and perhaps
