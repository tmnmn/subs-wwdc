00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:00.126 A:middle
better.

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
But remember, there are those

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:03.046 A:middle
two important buildings.

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:05.206 A:middle
Let's restyle Pantera's house

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.406 A:middle
and the pet store too.

00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.026 A:middle
And for the pet store we'll add

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:11.446 A:middle
a heart that matches the health

00:10:11.446 --> 00:10:12.866 A:middle
indicator as a visual cue.

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:16.886 A:middle
Okay. Now to restyle the parks.

00:10:17.246 --> 00:10:18.586 A:middle
They're really prominent right

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:20.216 A:middle
now, but they're not as

00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:21.646 A:middle
important as the sidewalks,

00:10:21.646 --> 00:10:22.776 A:middle
mice, or hazards.

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:24.986 A:middle
It makes sense to leave the park

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:27.126 A:middle
polygons green, since this color

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.726 A:middle
is often associated with parks.

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:30.586 A:middle
But I'm not satisfied with the

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:31.046 A:middle
shade.

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:32.426 A:middle
It's too dark and that makes it

00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:33.196 A:middle
distracting.

00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:36.386 A:middle
Okay, I think this lighter green

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.516 A:middle
is a nice change.

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:39.856 A:middle
White still seems like a good

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.046 A:middle
color for the sidewalks.

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:42.926 A:middle
Notice how it's standing out

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:44.336 A:middle
against the dark background.

00:10:44.456 --> 00:10:45.756 A:middle
But I think we should bump up

00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:46.466 A:middle
the line weight.

00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:48.706 A:middle
Yeah, better.

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:54.206 A:middle
Okay. So, the so the base map is

00:10:54.206 --> 00:10:56.286 A:middle
more muted now, and that means

00:10:56.286 --> 00:10:57.976 A:middle
that we can turn our attention

00:10:58.256 --> 00:10:59.666 A:middle
to the symbols and game

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:00.426 A:middle
elements.
