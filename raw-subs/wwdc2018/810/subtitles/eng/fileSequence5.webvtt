00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
map finding the mice and

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:02.426 A:middle
avoiding the hazards.

00:05:02.726 --> 00:05:04.036 A:middle
So, they'll need to see

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:06.566 A:middle
sidewalks, mice, and hazards.

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:08.966 A:middle
Okay, enough talking about maps.

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.266 A:middle
Let's get started building it.

00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:13.076 A:middle
We're not going to take the time

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:14.936 A:middle
to style it right away and we're

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:16.356 A:middle
going to be iterating on this

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
design throughout.

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:18.936 A:middle
This is going to be a work in

00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:20.946 A:middle
progress but we're going to keep

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.566 A:middle
the map purpose and the user

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:24.146 A:middle
goals in mind throughout.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.036 A:middle
So, we'll start with sidewalks

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:28.786 A:middle
because the street is too hot

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:29.946 A:middle
for delicate kitty toes and

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.796 A:middle
sometimes the grass is damp.

00:05:33.186 --> 00:05:34.366 A:middle
And then, we'll add the mice,

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:37.036 A:middle
and now those hazards.

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:41.366 A:middle
Dogs, Pantera is not a fan, as

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.166 A:middle
well as fountains, which

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:45.326 A:middle
sometimes unpredictably spray

00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:45.806 A:middle
water.

00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:49.556 A:middle
So, these are the essential

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.236 A:middle
elements from that list.

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:52.906 A:middle
But we should also include

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:54.726 A:middle
Pantera's house, where she

00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:55.766 A:middle
begins each round.

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:58.186 A:middle
Of course, Pantera herself.

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.856 A:middle
And the pet store where she can
