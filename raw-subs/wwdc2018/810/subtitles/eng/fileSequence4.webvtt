00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.726 A:middle
imaginary place, and perhaps

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.566 A:middle
most importantly, it's only

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.836 A:middle
going to exist at one scale.

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
If we were making a map where

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
users could zoom in and out,

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:10.136 A:middle
we'd need to think carefully

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:11.656 A:middle
about how our data and display

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:13.466 A:middle
might change at different zooms.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:15.826 A:middle
But this is a design studio

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.666 A:middle
short, not a design studio long.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:18.866 A:middle
So, we're going to stick with

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:19.826 A:middle
just one zoom.

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:22.326 A:middle
However, the principles are

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.056 A:middle
going to be the same whether

00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
your mapping a cat's escapades

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.786 A:middle
through a fictional neighborhood

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.026 A:middle
or making a dynamic map of the

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.106 A:middle
whole entire world.

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:32.796 A:middle
So, let's get started by

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.216 A:middle
thinking about the purpose of

00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:34.706 A:middle
this map.

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:36.846 A:middle
We want to make a game that

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:38.146 A:middle
would be perfect to play for a

00:04:38.146 --> 00:04:39.986 A:middle
few minutes on the bus, or while

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:41.106 A:middle
relaxing in a park.

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:42.736 A:middle
And we're going to want to make

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:43.786 A:middle
sure that our map really

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:44.566 A:middle
reflects this.

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:47.546 A:middle
It should be fun, kind of

00:04:47.546 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
cartoony, cute and lighthearted,

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:51.776 A:middle
and really simple to understand.

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:53.706 A:middle
So, let's think about what

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:55.026 A:middle
players will be doing within

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:55.656 A:middle
this game.

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:58.046 A:middle
It's pretty intuitive, they're

00:04:58.046 --> 00:04:59.126 A:middle
going to be moving around the

00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
map finding the mice and
