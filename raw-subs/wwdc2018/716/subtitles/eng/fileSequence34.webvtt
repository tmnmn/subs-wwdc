00:33:59.206 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
we expect them, the single one

00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:02.766 A:middle
in there as an observation.

00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:04.926 A:middle
What I'm going to do here, I'm

00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:06.936 A:middle
going to look at the confidence

00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:08.976 A:middle
property of my observation, and

00:34:08.976 --> 00:34:10.406 A:middle
I set an arbitrary threshold to

00:34:10.406 --> 00:34:11.036 A:middle
0.5.

00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:13.315 A:middle
So, if it's above the threshold,

00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:15.585 A:middle
I'm going to paint the bounding

00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:17.616 A:middle
box with solid line, and if it's

00:34:17.616 --> 00:34:18.846 A:middle
below the threshold, I'm going

00:34:18.846 --> 00:34:19.866 A:middle
to paint it with a dashed line.

00:34:19.866 --> 00:34:21.196 A:middle
So, I have, so I can have an

00:34:21.196 --> 00:34:22.856 A:middle
indication if something is going

00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:23.255 A:middle
wrong.

00:34:26.116 --> 00:34:27.616 A:middle
The rest is simple bookkeeping.

00:34:27.716 --> 00:34:30.216 A:middle
I'm just going to populate my

00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:32.636 A:middle
rect structure, and this is the

00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:33.795 A:middle
last step, which is very

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:34.966 A:middle
important where I take the

00:34:34.966 --> 00:34:36.076 A:middle
observation from the current

00:34:36.076 --> 00:34:38.916 A:middle
iteration, and I assign it for

00:34:38.916 --> 00:34:39.686 A:middle
the next iteration.

00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:44.866 A:middle
I'm going to do it a second

00:34:44.866 --> 00:34:45.136 A:middle
time.

00:34:46.085 --> 00:34:47.106 A:middle
I'm going to get to this

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:47.746 A:middle
breakpoint.

00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:50.346 A:middle
Going to display my frame.

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:53.136 A:middle
I'm going to sleep for the frame

00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:54.966 A:middle
rate in seconds time to simulate

00:34:54.966 --> 00:34:55.746 A:middle
the actual movie.

00:34:56.186 --> 00:34:58.096 A:middle
And then, before you know it,

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.816 A:middle
you're in the second iteration
