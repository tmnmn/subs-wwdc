00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
VNObservation class.

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:02.746 A:middle
How do we get an observation?

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:04.886 A:middle
Well, first, the most natural

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:06.566 A:middle
way is when the request is

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:07.746 A:middle
processed, you're going to look

00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:08.886 A:middle
at the results property of that

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:10.256 A:middle
request, and that results

00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:11.356 A:middle
property is a collection of

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:11.966 A:middle
observations.

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:13.516 A:middle
That's how we tell you results

00:05:13.726 --> 00:05:14.306 A:middle
of processing.

00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:18.606 A:middle
The second way is you create it

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:18.996 A:middle
manually.

00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:20.866 A:middle
We're going to look at examples

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.006 A:middle
for other presentations how to

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:22.336 A:middle
do both.

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:28.886 A:middle
Let's now look at what's new

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:29.636 A:middle
coming this year.

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:32.286 A:middle
First, we have our new face

00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:32.706 A:middle
detector.

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:36.336 A:middle
Now, we can detect more faces,

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:37.986 A:middle
and we're now

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:39.096 A:middle
orientation-agnostic.

00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:40.726 A:middle
Let's look at example.

00:05:41.186 --> 00:05:42.256 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you can

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.776 A:middle
see an image with seven faces in

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.806 A:middle
it, and we could process that

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:46.906 A:middle
image with the detector from

00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:48.236 A:middle
last year, we can detect only

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:50.206 A:middle
three faces, and those faces are

00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:51.746 A:middle
the ones that are close to the

00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:52.596 A:middle
upright position.

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:55.216 A:middle
If you process the same image

00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:56.596 A:middle
with the face detector that's

00:05:57.016 --> 00:05:58.426 A:middle
coming this year, as you can

00:05:58.426 --> 00:05:59.866 A:middle
see, all faces can be detected,

00:05:59.996 --> 00:06:01.256 A:middle
and orientation is not a problem
