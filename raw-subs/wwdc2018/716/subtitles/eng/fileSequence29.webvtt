00:29:06.756 --> 00:29:08.926 A:middle
Let's look at the more complex

00:29:08.926 --> 00:29:09.306 A:middle
example.

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.066 A:middle
What I want to track here, I

00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:13.186 A:middle
want to track this wakeboarder

00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:15.616 A:middle
guy, and in this case, I'm going

00:29:15.616 --> 00:29:16.636 A:middle
to use my accurate algorithm.

00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:18.756 A:middle
So, I'm going to select my

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:19.500 A:middle
object,

00:29:23.156 --> 00:29:25.000 A:middle
and I'm going to run it.

00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:31.566 A:middle
As you can see, this object

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.626 A:middle
changes pretty much everything

00:29:33.626 --> 00:29:35.316 A:middle
about itself, its shape, the

00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:37.006 A:middle
location, the colors, everything

00:29:37.006 --> 00:29:37.316 A:middle
comes.

00:29:37.316 --> 00:29:38.686 A:middle
We're still able to track it.

00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:39.976 A:middle
I think this is pretty cool.

00:29:40.516 --> 00:29:46.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:48.736 A:middle
Now, we're going to switch to my

00:29:48.736 --> 00:29:50.086 A:middle
demo machine and see how the

00:29:50.086 --> 00:29:51.366 A:middle
actual tracking sequence is

00:29:51.366 --> 00:29:53.000 A:middle
implemented in this app.
