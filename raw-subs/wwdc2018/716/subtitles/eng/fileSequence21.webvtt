00:21:02.566 --> 00:21:03.616 A:middle
We want your apps to have

00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:05.136 A:middle
optimal performance both in

00:21:05.136 --> 00:21:06.576 A:middle
terms of memory usage and

00:21:06.576 --> 00:21:07.356 A:middle
execution speed.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.486 A:middle
That's why it's important to

00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:09.586 A:middle
look at the next two slides.

00:21:11.696 --> 00:21:12.956 A:middle
How long should you keep your

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.346 A:middle
objects in memory?

00:21:16.756 --> 00:21:17.956 A:middle
Well, for the image request

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:19.356 A:middle
handler, you should keep it as

00:21:19.416 --> 00:21:21.066 A:middle
long as the image needs

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:21.486 A:middle
processing.

00:21:22.356 --> 00:21:23.716 A:middle
This may sound like a very

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:24.936 A:middle
innocent and simple statement,

00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:26.496 A:middle
but it is very important that

00:21:26.496 --> 00:21:28.296 A:middle
you do just that.

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:29.736 A:middle
If you release the object early,

00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:31.066 A:middle
and you still have outstanding

00:21:31.066 --> 00:21:32.446 A:middle
requests to be processed, you

00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:33.716 A:middle
will have to recreate your image

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:34.386 A:middle
to request handler.

00:21:34.716 --> 00:21:36.346 A:middle
But now you have lost all the

00:21:36.346 --> 00:21:37.676 A:middle
cache that was associated with

00:21:37.676 --> 00:21:39.066 A:middle
the previous object, and you'll

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:40.636 A:middle
have to pay this performance to

00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:42.036 A:middle
recalculate these derivatives.

00:21:42.666 --> 00:21:45.386 A:middle
If you release it too late, on

00:21:45.386 --> 00:21:47.546 A:middle
the other hand, then, first

00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:48.486 A:middle
you're going to start causing

00:21:48.486 --> 00:21:50.196 A:middle
memory fragmentation, and then

00:21:50.196 --> 00:21:51.416 A:middle
the memory is not going to be

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:53.006 A:middle
reclaimed by your app for other

00:21:53.006 --> 00:21:54.606 A:middle
meaningful things that you want

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:55.500 A:middle
to do.

00:21:56.156 --> 00:21:57.696 A:middle
So, it's important to release

00:21:57.696 --> 00:21:59.236 A:middle
it, use it as long as you need

00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:00.176 A:middle
and release it right after.
