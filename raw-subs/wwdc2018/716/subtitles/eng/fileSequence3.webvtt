00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
and CoreML, I invite you to come

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.246 A:middle
to the next session in this room

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.756 A:middle
where Fran, my colleague, will

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:05.246 A:middle
cover details of that

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:05.786 A:middle
integration.

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:09.546 A:middle
Let's take a look at the request

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:09.956 A:middle
handlers.

00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:12.226 A:middle
In Vision, we have two.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:13.896 A:middle
We have Image Request Handler,

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:15.766 A:middle
and we have Sequence Request

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:16.046 A:middle
Handler.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:18.446 A:middle
Let's compare the two using this

00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:18.826 A:middle
criteria.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.196 A:middle
First, we'll look at the Image

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:21.736 A:middle
Request Handler.

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:25.326 A:middle
Image request handler is used to

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:27.996 A:middle
process one or more requests on

00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:28.666 A:middle
the same image.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.676 A:middle
What it doesn't say, it caches

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:33.066 A:middle
certain information like image

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:34.796 A:middle
derivatives and results of

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:35.636 A:middle
posting requests.

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:37.216 A:middle
So, other requests in the

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.416 A:middle
pipeline can use that

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:39.006 A:middle
information.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:40.526 A:middle
I'm going to give you an

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:41.036 A:middle
example.

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.116 A:middle
If a request depends on running

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:44.606 A:middle
neural network, as you know,

00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:46.436 A:middle
neural network expects images in

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:47.876 A:middle
certain sizes and certain colors

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:48.276 A:middle
schemes.

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:49.926 A:middle
Let's say your neural network

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:52.706 A:middle
expects 500 by 500 black and

00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:52.906 A:middle
white.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:55.446 A:middle
It's very rare that you'll get

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:57.006 A:middle
user input just in that format.

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.786 A:middle
So, what we'll do inside, we'll

00:03:58.786 --> 00:03:59.626 A:middle
convert the image.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.066 A:middle
We'll feed it into that neural
