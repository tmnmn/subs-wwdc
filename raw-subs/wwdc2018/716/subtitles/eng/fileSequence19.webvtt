00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.176 A:middle
this, so you get some unique

00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:02.226 A:middle
number to identify this

00:19:02.226 --> 00:19:03.386 A:middle
particular processing step.

00:19:04.146 --> 00:19:05.326 A:middle
Then, you get the bounding box

00:19:05.326 --> 00:19:06.476 A:middle
location, which is the main

00:19:06.476 --> 00:19:08.326 A:middle
outcome of processing this

00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:08.716 A:middle
request.

00:19:08.946 --> 00:19:10.616 A:middle
And the landmarks field is set

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:11.916 A:middle
to nil because face detector

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:12.986 A:middle
doesn't know anything about

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:13.496 A:middle
landmarks.

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.246 A:middle
What I'm going to do next is I'm

00:19:16.336 --> 00:19:17.526 A:middle
going to create my landmarks

00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:19.266 A:middle
request, and then I'm going to

00:19:19.266 --> 00:19:20.096 A:middle
take the results from the

00:19:20.096 --> 00:19:22.166 A:middle
previous step and feed it into

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:23.446 A:middle
the input object observation

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:24.556 A:middle
property of that request.

00:19:25.996 --> 00:19:26.866 A:middle
Then, I'm going to ask my

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.336 A:middle
request handler to process it.

00:19:29.306 --> 00:19:30.206 A:middle
And finally, I'm going to look

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:30.836 A:middle
at the results.

00:19:31.726 --> 00:19:33.396 A:middle
If I run it in the same image, I

00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:35.146 A:middle
get exactly the same results as

00:19:35.146 --> 00:19:37.786 A:middle
I would on the previous slide.

00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:39.836 A:middle
But let's see what happens with

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:40.486 A:middle
observations.

00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:41.826 A:middle
Remember, we said that

00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:43.906 A:middle
observations are immutable even

00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:45.876 A:middle
though both face detector and

00:19:45.876 --> 00:19:48.136 A:middle
face landmarks detector return

00:19:48.136 --> 00:19:50.006 A:middle
the same type, but we don't

00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:51.766 A:middle
override the observation that

00:19:51.976 --> 00:19:52.656 A:middle
was fed in.

00:19:53.296 --> 00:19:54.716 A:middle
What we do instead, we take the

00:19:54.716 --> 00:19:56.696 A:middle
first two fields and copy it

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.776 A:middle
into a new object, and then we

00:19:58.776 --> 00:20:00.326 A:middle
calculate landmarks and populate
