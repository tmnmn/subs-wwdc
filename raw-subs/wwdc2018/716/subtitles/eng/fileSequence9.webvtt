00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
a couple of points about the

00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:01.866 A:middle
code samples in this

00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:02.506 A:middle
presentation.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.956 A:middle
The error handling is not a good

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.136 A:middle
example how errors should be

00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:06.526 A:middle
handled.

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.796 A:middle
I use a short version of try,

00:09:07.876 --> 00:09:09.026 A:middle
and I use [inaudible].

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:11.136 A:middle
This is just to simplify the

00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:11.686 A:middle
examples.

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:12.906 A:middle
When you code your apps, you

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:14.356 A:middle
probably should use guards to

00:09:14.356 --> 00:09:15.526 A:middle
protect against unwanted

00:09:15.526 --> 00:09:15.946 A:middle
behavior.

00:09:17.186 --> 00:09:20.086 A:middle
I also use Image URL when I

00:09:20.256 --> 00:09:22.346 A:middle
create my image request handler

00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:24.416 A:middle
objects, and that is just a

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:26.716 A:middle
place on the SSD where the file

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:27.236 A:middle
is located.

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:29.416 A:middle
Now, let's look at example.

00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:32.046 A:middle
First, I'm going to create my

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.346 A:middle
detect faces request object.

00:09:35.136 --> 00:09:36.476 A:middle
Then, I'm going to create my

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:38.036 A:middle
image request handler passing

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.036 A:middle
the image URL with the file of

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:41.866 A:middle
the image where the faces should

00:09:41.866 --> 00:09:42.336 A:middle
be located.

00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:44.526 A:middle
Then, I'm going to ask my

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:45.716 A:middle
request handler to process my

00:09:45.716 --> 00:09:46.186 A:middle
request.

00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:47.796 A:middle
And finally, I'm going to look

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.500 A:middle
at the results.

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:50.506 A:middle
Very simple.

00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:52.276 A:middle
If I had an image with a single

00:09:52.276 --> 00:09:54.036 A:middle
face in it, my results would

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:55.330 A:middle
look something like this.
