00:12:06.196 --> 00:12:07.726 A:middle
How to create a request object.

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:10.616 A:middle
Well, first, it's important to

00:12:10.616 --> 00:12:11.846 A:middle
understand that our requests

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:13.066 A:middle
have two types of properties.

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:14.706 A:middle
There are mandatory properties

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:15.766 A:middle
and there are optional

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:16.346 A:middle
properties.

00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:18.406 A:middle
And mandatory properties, as the

00:12:18.406 --> 00:12:20.066 A:middle
name suggests, they need to be

00:12:20.066 --> 00:12:21.826 A:middle
provided via initializer in

00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:23.696 A:middle
order to be able to create a

00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:24.436 A:middle
request object.

00:12:24.436 --> 00:12:26.826 A:middle
Let's look at the example.

00:12:28.216 --> 00:12:29.766 A:middle
There is something that would

00:12:29.766 --> 00:12:30.926 A:middle
just go in the previous slide.

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:33.046 A:middle
I detected object observation

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:34.366 A:middle
that is passed into the

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:35.686 A:middle
initializer of the [inaudible]

00:12:35.686 --> 00:12:37.676 A:middle
object request is an example of

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:39.396 A:middle
a mandatory property.

00:12:40.356 --> 00:12:41.486 A:middle
We also have optional

00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:42.066 A:middle
properties.

00:12:43.466 --> 00:12:44.276 A:middle
By the way, both types of

00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:45.396 A:middle
properties are declared.

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.026 A:middle
You can find them in the place

00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:49.906 A:middle
where the request object is

00:12:50.696 --> 00:12:50.946 A:middle
declared.

00:12:51.016 --> 00:12:53.076 A:middle
Optional properties is separate

00:12:53.076 --> 00:12:54.306 A:middle
properties where we have

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:55.506 A:middle
meaningful defaults for them.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.306 A:middle
So, we'll initialize them for

00:12:57.306 --> 00:12:58.776 A:middle
you, but you can override them

00:12:58.776 --> 00:12:59.656 A:middle
later if you need to.
