00:17:59.316 --> 00:18:01.136 A:middle
on our behalf inside face

00:18:01.136 --> 00:18:01.546 A:middle
detector.

00:18:02.106 --> 00:18:03.686 A:middle
It gets results from that face

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:05.306 A:middle
detector, and that's where

00:18:05.306 --> 00:18:06.536 A:middle
landmarks are being searched

00:18:06.536 --> 00:18:06.716 A:middle
for.

00:18:08.716 --> 00:18:10.896 A:middle
On the right-hand side, you can

00:18:11.306 --> 00:18:14.186 A:middle
see a snippet of what face

00:18:14.186 --> 00:18:15.386 A:middle
observation object would look

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:15.566 A:middle
like.

00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:16.576 A:middle
These are just a couple of

00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:17.446 A:middle
fields from that object.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.296 A:middle
One is a unique ID that we

00:18:19.296 --> 00:18:20.376 A:middle
discussed that is set to some

00:18:20.376 --> 00:18:20.956 A:middle
unique number.

00:18:21.656 --> 00:18:23.316 A:middle
Then, the bounding box, that's

00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:25.216 A:middle
where the face is located, and

00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:26.436 A:middle
then, finally, the landmarks

00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:27.936 A:middle
field, which points to some

00:18:27.936 --> 00:18:29.216 A:middle
object where the landmarks are

00:18:29.216 --> 00:18:29.656 A:middle
described.

00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:35.236 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:18:35.236 --> 00:18:37.716 A:middle
same use case but now done

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:38.336 A:middle
explicitly.

00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:41.556 A:middle
What I'm going to do here

00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:42.876 A:middle
first-- first, I'm going to

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:44.486 A:middle
explicitly run my face detector.

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:47.516 A:middle
You've seen these four lines of

00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:49.076 A:middle
code already several times in

00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:49.796 A:middle
the presentation.

00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:51.346 A:middle
When I run it, I get my bounding

00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:51.786 A:middle
box back.

00:18:52.606 --> 00:18:54.376 A:middle
As you can see, the results are

00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:56.016 A:middle
returned in the same type, face

00:18:56.016 --> 00:18:56.616 A:middle
observation.

00:18:57.276 --> 00:18:58.796 A:middle
The fields that we saw on the

00:18:58.796 --> 00:18:59.946 A:middle
previous slide may look like

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.176 A:middle
this, so you get some unique
