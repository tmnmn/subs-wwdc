00:35:59.966 --> 00:36:00.466 A:middle
one-to-one.

00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:04.656 A:middle
We also saw that there are two

00:36:04.656 --> 00:36:05.506 A:middle
types of trackers.

00:36:05.806 --> 00:36:06.916 A:middle
One is the general purpose

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:08.396 A:middle
tracker, and another one is

00:36:08.396 --> 00:36:10.216 A:middle
rectangular object tracker.

00:36:12.396 --> 00:36:13.576 A:middle
We also learned that there are

00:36:13.576 --> 00:36:15.636 A:middle
two algorithms for each tracker

00:36:15.636 --> 00:36:15.906 A:middle
type.

00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:18.116 A:middle
There is fast and accurate, and

00:36:18.116 --> 00:36:20.366 A:middle
this represents the tradeoff

00:36:20.366 --> 00:36:21.646 A:middle
between speed and accuracy.

00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:24.766 A:middle
And last but not least, we

00:36:24.866 --> 00:36:25.946 A:middle
looked at how to use a

00:36:25.946 --> 00:36:28.116 A:middle
confidence level property to

00:36:28.116 --> 00:36:29.586 A:middle
judge whether we should or

00:36:29.586 --> 00:36:30.716 A:middle
should not trust our results.

00:36:34.516 --> 00:36:35.796 A:middle
What are the limits of

00:36:35.796 --> 00:36:37.046 A:middle
implementing tracking sequence

00:36:37.046 --> 00:36:37.446 A:middle
in Vision?

00:36:38.006 --> 00:36:42.406 A:middle
First, let's talk about number

00:36:42.496 --> 00:36:43.646 A:middle
of trackers.

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.866 A:middle
How many objects can you track

00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:47.546 A:middle
simultaneously?

00:36:48.446 --> 00:36:49.796 A:middle
Well, in Vision we have a limit

00:36:50.066 --> 00:36:53.186 A:middle
that is set to 16 trackers for

00:36:53.186 --> 00:36:53.666 A:middle
each type.

00:36:54.006 --> 00:36:55.346 A:middle
So, you can have 16 general

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:57.446 A:middle
purpose object trackers and 16

00:36:58.076 --> 00:36:59.206 A:middle
rectangular object trackers.
