00:14:00.036 --> 00:14:01.076 A:middle
But whenever you have the

00:14:01.076 --> 00:14:02.816 A:middle
object, it's the object that you

00:14:02.816 --> 00:14:04.500 A:middle
can work with.

00:14:07.536 --> 00:14:08.526 A:middle
One thing that's not maybe on

00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:09.776 A:middle
this slide is, which will be

00:14:09.776 --> 00:14:10.866 A:middle
covered in more details in the

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:14.556 A:middle
next session, is to look at the

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:15.406 A:middle
bounding boxes.

00:14:16.046 --> 00:14:18.456 A:middle
As you can see, the coordinates

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
that we receive are normalized.

00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:22.576 A:middle
They are from 0 to 1 and they're

00:14:22.576 --> 00:14:23.976 A:middle
always relative to the lower

00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:24.446 A:middle
left corner.

00:14:25.146 --> 00:14:26.166 A:middle
The next session, which is

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.506 A:middle
CoreML integration with Vision,

00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:29.196 A:middle
will cover this aspect in more

00:14:29.196 --> 00:14:29.686 A:middle
details.

00:14:33.336 --> 00:14:34.806 A:middle
Let's look at how to understand

00:14:34.806 --> 00:14:35.256 A:middle
results.

00:14:35.906 --> 00:14:38.616 A:middle
As we said, results in Vision

00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:40.266 A:middle
come in forms of observations.

00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:43.726 A:middle
Observations are populated

00:14:43.726 --> 00:14:45.046 A:middle
through results property of the

00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:45.696 A:middle
request object.

00:14:46.466 --> 00:14:47.526 A:middle
How many observations can you

00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:47.806 A:middle
get?

00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:51.726 A:middle
All the collection be 0 to N.

00:14:52.596 --> 00:14:53.726 A:middle
There's one more aspect here.

00:14:54.046 --> 00:14:55.796 A:middle
If you get results set to nil,

00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:57.096 A:middle
that means that the [inaudible]

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.286 A:middle
single request failed.

00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:00.516 A:middle
This is different than getting 0
