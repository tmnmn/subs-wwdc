00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:01.236 A:middle
we will try to do that first.

00:23:01.996 --> 00:23:03.346 A:middle
If GPU is not available for

00:23:03.346 --> 00:23:04.616 A:middle
whatever reason at that point in

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.176 A:middle
time, we will switch to CPU

00:23:06.766 --> 00:23:08.896 A:middle
because that's our default

00:23:08.896 --> 00:23:09.306 A:middle
behavior.

00:23:09.946 --> 00:23:12.846 A:middle
But let's say your application

00:23:13.326 --> 00:23:14.876 A:middle
is dependent on displaying a lot

00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:16.306 A:middle
of graphics on the screen, so

00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:18.276 A:middle
you may want to save the GPU for

00:23:18.276 --> 00:23:19.446 A:middle
that particular job.

00:23:20.176 --> 00:23:21.386 A:middle
In this case, you can override

00:23:21.766 --> 00:23:23.526 A:middle
user CPU on the property and set

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:24.736 A:middle
it to true on the request

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:25.036 A:middle
object.

00:23:25.576 --> 00:23:26.886 A:middle
This will tell us to process

00:23:26.886 --> 00:23:28.856 A:middle
your request directly on the

00:23:28.856 --> 00:23:29.000 A:middle
CPU.

00:23:35.316 --> 00:23:37.176 A:middle
Now that we've covered basic how

00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:39.236 A:middle
to interact with Vision, Vision

00:23:39.236 --> 00:23:41.276 A:middle
API, in particular, we've seen a

00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:43.136 A:middle
couple of examples, let's switch

00:23:43.136 --> 00:23:44.016 A:middle
to the main topic of our

00:23:44.016 --> 00:23:45.916 A:middle
presentation, which is tracking

00:23:46.046 --> 00:23:47.166 A:middle
in Vision.

00:23:48.616 --> 00:23:49.636 A:middle
So, what is tracking?

00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:52.746 A:middle
Tracking is defined as a problem

00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:54.406 A:middle
of finding an object of interest

00:23:54.756 --> 00:23:55.716 A:middle
in a sequence of frames.

00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:57.466 A:middle
Usually, you find that object in

00:23:57.466 --> 00:23:59.256 A:middle
the first frame, and you try to

00:23:59.426 --> 00:24:00.846 A:middle
look for it in the sequence of
