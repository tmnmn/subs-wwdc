00:39:58.656 --> 00:40:01.626 A:middle
And finally, we looked at how to

00:40:01.626 --> 00:40:03.396 A:middle
implement tracking sequence in

00:40:03.856 --> 00:40:04.000 A:middle
Vision.

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:06.886 A:middle
For more information, I

00:40:06.886 --> 00:40:08.046 A:middle
recommend you to refer to this

00:40:08.046 --> 00:40:09.976 A:middle
link on the slide.

00:40:10.556 --> 00:40:12.176 A:middle
I can also recommend you to stay

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:13.226 A:middle
for the next session, which will

00:40:13.226 --> 00:40:14.396 A:middle
be at 3 o'clock in this room

00:40:14.646 --> 00:40:16.026 A:middle
where Frank will cover details

00:40:16.026 --> 00:40:17.116 A:middle
of integration of Vision and

00:40:17.116 --> 00:40:17.566 A:middle
CoreML.

00:40:17.896 --> 00:40:19.226 A:middle
This is especially important if

00:40:19.226 --> 00:40:20.086 A:middle
you want to deploy your own

00:40:20.086 --> 00:40:20.546 A:middle
models.

00:40:21.246 --> 00:40:22.396 A:middle
That session will also cover

00:40:22.396 --> 00:40:24.576 A:middle
some details about Vision

00:40:24.576 --> 00:40:25.736 A:middle
Framework that were not covered

00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:26.296 A:middle
by this session.

00:40:27.636 --> 00:40:28.676 A:middle
And we'll also have Vison Lab

00:40:28.706 --> 00:40:30.166 A:middle
tomorrow, which is 3 to 5.

00:40:31.176 --> 00:40:33.056 A:middle
Thank you and have a great rest

00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:34.000 A:middle
of your WWDC.
