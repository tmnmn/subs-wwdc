00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:00.516 A:middle
This is different than getting 0

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:01.256 A:middle
observations met.

00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:03.666 A:middle
Getting 0 observations met means

00:15:03.666 --> 00:15:04.736 A:middle
that whatever you were looking

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:05.946 A:middle
for is just not there.

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:08.796 A:middle
As an example, let's say you run

00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:09.526 A:middle
a face detector.

00:15:10.816 --> 00:15:11.846 A:middle
If you feed an image with no

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.306 A:middle
faces in it, naturally, you will

00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:14.476 A:middle
get 0 observations met.

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:16.596 A:middle
On the other hand, if you feed

00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:18.336 A:middle
the image with one or more faces

00:15:18.726 --> 00:15:20.896 A:middle
in it, you'll get appropriate

00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:22.606 A:middle
number of observations met.

00:15:24.036 --> 00:15:25.506 A:middle
Another important property of

00:15:25.506 --> 00:15:27.196 A:middle
observations is that

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:28.446 A:middle
observations are immutable.

00:15:28.446 --> 00:15:30.016 A:middle
We will look at the example

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:31.696 A:middle
where it's used.

00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:34.286 A:middle
There are two more properties

00:15:34.286 --> 00:15:34.996 A:middle
that I want to pay your

00:15:34.996 --> 00:15:36.406 A:middle
attention to, and they are both

00:15:36.406 --> 00:15:37.566 A:middle
declared in the base [inaudible]

00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:38.846 A:middle
for all observations.

00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:40.416 A:middle
One is the unique ID.

00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:42.586 A:middle
This unique ID identifies the

00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:44.326 A:middle
processing step for this

00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:45.226 A:middle
particular-- where this

00:15:45.226 --> 00:15:46.666 A:middle
particular result was created.

00:15:47.576 --> 00:15:48.836 A:middle
Another one is the confidence

00:15:48.836 --> 00:15:49.136 A:middle
level.

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:51.756 A:middle
Confidence level tells you how

00:15:51.756 --> 00:15:53.126 A:middle
confident the algorithm was

00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:54.316 A:middle
producing the results.

00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:57.756 A:middle
The confidence is in the range

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:58.526 A:middle
from 0 to 1.

00:15:59.176 --> 00:16:00.646 A:middle
Again, this topic also will be
