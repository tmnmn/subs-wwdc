00:05:59.996 --> 00:06:01.256 A:middle
and orientation is not a problem

00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:01.556 A:middle
anymore.

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:04.516 A:middle
Let's look a little bit more

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:04.966 A:middle
into details.

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:06.096 A:middle
Thank you.

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:09.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:17.976 A:middle
So, first, our new face detector

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.226 A:middle
uses the same API as from last

00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:20.456 A:middle
year.

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:22.196 A:middle
The only difference is if you

00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:23.426 A:middle
want to specify revision, you

00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:24.636 A:middle
need to overwrite a revision

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.236 A:middle
property of that request and set

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:28.056 A:middle
it explicitly to User Vision #2.

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:29.196 A:middle
Again, I'll talk about the

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:30.336 A:middle
reasons right on the next slide.

00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:33.466 A:middle
We're also introducing two new

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:34.116 A:middle
properties.

00:06:34.566 --> 00:06:36.516 A:middle
One is roll, which is when the

00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:38.126 A:middle
head rotates like this, and the

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:39.856 A:middle
other one is yaw, which when the

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.500 A:middle
head rotates around the neck.

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:45.676 A:middle
Revisions.

00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
What happens with Vision where

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:48.696 A:middle
when we need to introducing a

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:50.156 A:middle
new algorithm, we don't

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:51.246 A:middle
deprecate the old one right

00:06:51.246 --> 00:06:51.516 A:middle
away.

00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:53.486 A:middle
Instead, we're going to keep for

00:06:53.486 --> 00:06:55.026 A:middle
some time both revisions or,

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:56.396 A:middle
maybe going forward, even more,

00:06:56.956 --> 00:06:57.696 A:middle
simultaneously.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:06:59.896 A:middle
You tell us which one you want

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:01.186 A:middle
to work with by specifying
