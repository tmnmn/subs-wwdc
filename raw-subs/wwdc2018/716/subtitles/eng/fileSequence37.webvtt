00:37:00.306 --> 00:37:01.826 A:middle
If you try to allocate more,

00:37:01.826 --> 00:37:02.806 A:middle
you'll get an error back.

00:37:03.976 --> 00:37:06.556 A:middle
So, if it happens, you probably

00:37:06.556 --> 00:37:07.526 A:middle
need to release some of the

00:37:07.526 --> 00:37:08.446 A:middle
trackers that you're already

00:37:08.446 --> 00:37:08.776 A:middle
using.

00:37:09.506 --> 00:37:12.576 A:middle
How to do that?

00:37:12.576 --> 00:37:14.426 A:middle
First way is you can set a last

00:37:14.426 --> 00:37:16.576 A:middle
frame property under request and

00:37:16.576 --> 00:37:18.366 A:middle
feed that request into the

00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:19.716 A:middle
request handler for processing.

00:37:20.186 --> 00:37:21.436 A:middle
That way, the request handler

00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:23.006 A:middle
will know that the tracker

00:37:23.006 --> 00:37:24.206 A:middle
associated with this request

00:37:24.206 --> 00:37:25.416 A:middle
object should be released.

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:27.936 A:middle
Another way is to release the

00:37:27.936 --> 00:37:29.196 A:middle
entire sequence request handler;

00:37:29.466 --> 00:37:31.136 A:middle
in this case, all the trackers

00:37:31.136 --> 00:37:32.396 A:middle
associated with that request

00:37:32.396 --> 00:37:34.000 A:middle
handler will be released.

00:37:38.086 --> 00:37:39.646 A:middle
Now, let's say you've

00:37:39.646 --> 00:37:40.566 A:middle
implemented the tracking

00:37:40.566 --> 00:37:41.046 A:middle
signals.

00:37:41.356 --> 00:37:42.206 A:middle
What are the potential

00:37:42.206 --> 00:37:43.456 A:middle
challenges that you may face?

00:37:44.486 --> 00:37:46.666 A:middle
Well, as you've seen, objects in

00:37:46.666 --> 00:37:47.836 A:middle
tracking sequence can change

00:37:47.836 --> 00:37:49.276 A:middle
pretty much everything about

00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:49.836 A:middle
themselves.

00:37:50.076 --> 00:37:50.966 A:middle
They can change their shape,

00:37:50.966 --> 00:37:53.616 A:middle
appearance, color, location, and

00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:54.566 A:middle
that represents a great

00:37:54.566 --> 00:37:55.606 A:middle
challenge for the algorithm.

00:37:56.606 --> 00:37:57.546 A:middle
So, what can you do here?

00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:00.066 A:middle
Well, one unfortunate answer is
