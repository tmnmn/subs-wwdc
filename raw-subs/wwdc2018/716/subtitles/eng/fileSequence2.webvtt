00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.686 A:middle
terms, what to process, how to

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.016 A:middle
process, and where to look for

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:03.326 A:middle
results.

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:06.076 A:middle
What to process is about a

00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:07.056 A:middle
family of requests.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.006 A:middle
That is how you tell us what you

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:09.395 A:middle
want to do.

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:12.986 A:middle
How is about our request

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:14.506 A:middle
handlers or engines-- our

00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:16.246 A:middle
request handlers, they're used

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:18.156 A:middle
to process our requests.

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:20.906 A:middle
And finally, the results; the

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.546 A:middle
results in Vision come in forms

00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:23.406 A:middle
of observations.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:25.316 A:middle
Please take a look at this

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:25.576 A:middle
slide.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.546 A:middle
If you were to remember anything

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:28.986 A:middle
from this presentation, this

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:29.956 A:middle
slide is probably one of the

00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:30.876 A:middle
more important ones.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:32.536 A:middle
This slide presents a

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:33.866 A:middle
philosophy, how to interact with

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.076 A:middle
Vision, requests, request

00:02:36.706 --> 00:02:37.346 A:middle
handlers,

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:41.096 A:middle
and observations.

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:43.186 A:middle
Let's look at the requests

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:43.566 A:middle
first.

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.126 A:middle
This is a collection of requests

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:46.866 A:middle
that we offer today.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.386 A:middle
As you can see, we have various

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:49.936 A:middle
detectors.

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.696 A:middle
We have Image Registration

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:52.096 A:middle
Request.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:54.626 A:middle
We have two trackers, and we

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.826 A:middle
have a CoreML request.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.426 A:middle
If you're interested to learn

00:02:57.426 --> 00:02:59.116 A:middle
more about integration of Vision

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.956 A:middle
and CoreML, I invite you to come
