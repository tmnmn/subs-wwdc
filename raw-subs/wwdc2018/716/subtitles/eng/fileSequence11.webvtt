00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
Then, I'm going to start my

00:11:00.256 --> 00:11:01.056 A:middle
tracking signals.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.486 A:middle
In this example, I'm going to

00:11:03.486 --> 00:11:04.676 A:middle
track my object for five

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:05.626 A:middle
consecutive frames.

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:07.876 A:middle
Let's look how the sequence

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:08.236 A:middle
works.

00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:10.636 A:middle
First, I have a frame feeder

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:11.946 A:middle
object, which in your case could

00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:13.206 A:middle
be like camera feed, for

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:13.566 A:middle
example.

00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:15.546 A:middle
This is where I get my frames.

00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:18.416 A:middle
I get my frame, I create my

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:19.666 A:middle
request object, passing the

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:21.456 A:middle
detected object observation as a

00:11:21.456 --> 00:11:23.886 A:middle
parameter with its initializer.

00:11:24.326 --> 00:11:25.706 A:middle
And that's something that I just

00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:26.876 A:middle
created before the loop started.

00:11:27.496 --> 00:11:29.596 A:middle
Then, I'm going to ask my

00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:31.296 A:middle
request handler to process

00:11:31.296 --> 00:11:31.666 A:middle
request.

00:11:32.296 --> 00:11:34.396 A:middle
I'm going to look at the

00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:35.646 A:middle
results, and this is the place

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:37.166 A:middle
where I should be analyzing

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:38.376 A:middle
results and doing something with

00:11:38.376 --> 00:11:38.626 A:middle
them.

00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:41.766 A:middle
And the last step, which is very

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:43.426 A:middle
important, what I'm doing here,

00:11:43.776 --> 00:11:44.956 A:middle
I'm taking the results from the

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:46.196 A:middle
current iteration, and I'm

00:11:46.236 --> 00:11:47.376 A:middle
passing it to the next

00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:48.026 A:middle
iteration.

00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:49.426 A:middle
So, when the next iteration

00:11:49.426 --> 00:11:50.846 A:middle
request is created, I want to

00:11:50.846 --> 00:11:51.846 A:middle
see those results inside.

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:53.456 A:middle
If I were to want it in a

00:11:53.606 --> 00:11:54.786 A:middle
sequence of five frames, my

00:11:54.786 --> 00:11:55.756 A:middle
results would look something

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:55.976 A:middle
like this.
