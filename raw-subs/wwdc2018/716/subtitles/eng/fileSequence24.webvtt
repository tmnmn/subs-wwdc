00:23:59.426 --> 00:24:00.846 A:middle
look for it in the sequence of

00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:01.206 A:middle
frames.

00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:03.356 A:middle
What are the examples of such

00:24:03.356 --> 00:24:03.956 A:middle
application?

00:24:04.606 --> 00:24:06.036 A:middle
You will probably see many of

00:24:06.036 --> 00:24:06.206 A:middle
them.

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:10.056 A:middle
It's live annotational sports

00:24:10.056 --> 00:24:11.136 A:middle
events, focus tracking with

00:24:11.136 --> 00:24:15.266 A:middle
camera, many, many others.

00:24:15.466 --> 00:24:16.976 A:middle
You may say why should they use

00:24:16.976 --> 00:24:18.496 A:middle
tracking if I can do detection

00:24:18.816 --> 00:24:20.006 A:middle
on every frame in the sequence?

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.116 A:middle
Well, there are multiple reasons

00:24:22.116 --> 00:24:22.426 A:middle
for that.

00:24:23.196 --> 00:24:25.156 A:middle
First, you probably don't have a

00:24:25.156 --> 00:24:26.396 A:middle
specific tracker for every

00:24:26.396 --> 00:24:27.576 A:middle
single type of object that you

00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:29.056 A:middle
want to track.

00:24:29.056 --> 00:24:29.846 A:middle
Let's say if you're tracking

00:24:29.846 --> 00:24:31.296 A:middle
faces, you're lucky.

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:32.866 A:middle
You have a face detector for

00:24:32.866 --> 00:24:33.436 A:middle
that purpose.

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:35.306 A:middle
But if you need, for example, to

00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:37.126 A:middle
track a specific type of bird,

00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:39.236 A:middle
you probably don't have that

00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:40.306 A:middle
detector, and now you're in the

00:24:40.306 --> 00:24:41.516 A:middle
business to create that

00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:43.306 A:middle
particular detector, which you

00:24:43.306 --> 00:24:44.706 A:middle
may not want to do because of

00:24:44.706 --> 00:24:46.886 A:middle
the other things that you want

00:24:47.036 --> 00:24:48.036 A:middle
to have done with your

00:24:48.036 --> 00:24:48.456 A:middle
application.

00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:51.696 A:middle
But let's say you are lucky, and

00:24:51.696 --> 00:24:53.366 A:middle
you're tracking faces, should

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:54.396 A:middle
you use detector then?

00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:56.966 A:middle
Well, probably not in this case

00:24:57.076 --> 00:24:57.196 A:middle
either.

00:24:58.176 --> 00:24:59.106 A:middle
So, let's look an example.
