00:27:57.456 --> 00:28:00.586 A:middle
the movie; it parses that movie

00:28:00.586 --> 00:28:01.246 A:middle
into frames.

00:28:02.106 --> 00:28:03.186 A:middle
In the first frame, you select

00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:03.576 A:middle
an object.

00:28:03.696 --> 00:28:04.716 A:middle
You want to track a multiple

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.276 A:middle
objects or you want to track,

00:28:06.276 --> 00:28:08.526 A:middle
and it does the tracking.

00:28:08.656 --> 00:28:10.446 A:middle
So, let's first use this movie.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:13.006 A:middle
The user interface is simple.

00:28:13.466 --> 00:28:14.436 A:middle
First, you can choose between

00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:15.956 A:middle
objects or rectangles, and

00:28:15.956 --> 00:28:17.526 A:middle
second, you can choose which

00:28:17.526 --> 00:28:19.016 A:middle
algorithm you want to use, fast

00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:19.486 A:middle
or accurate.

00:28:19.926 --> 00:28:21.056 A:middle
What happens in Vision that we

00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:23.586 A:middle
support two types, fast and

00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:24.756 A:middle
accurate, and this is a

00:28:24.756 --> 00:28:26.536 A:middle
trade-off between the speed and

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:27.016 A:middle
the accuracy.

00:28:27.676 --> 00:28:29.776 A:middle
I'm going to show objects in

00:28:29.776 --> 00:28:30.926 A:middle
this case, and I'm going to use

00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:31.856 A:middle
my fast algorithm.

00:28:32.946 --> 00:28:33.766 A:middle
Let's select objects.

00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:36.026 A:middle
So, I'm going to track this

00:28:36.026 --> 00:28:38.436 A:middle
person under the red umbrella,

00:28:38.736 --> 00:28:40.136 A:middle
and I'm going to try to track

00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:41.000 A:middle
this group of people here.

00:28:46.156 --> 00:28:48.000 A:middle
Let's run it.

00:28:54.436 --> 00:28:55.856 A:middle
As you can see, we can

00:28:55.856 --> 00:28:58.706 A:middle
successfully track the object

00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:00.000 A:middle
that we selected.
