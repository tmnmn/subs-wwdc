00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:00.066 A:middle
Well, one unfortunate answer is

00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:01.246 A:middle
that there's no one size that

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:02.916 A:middle
fits all solution here, but you

00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:03.846 A:middle
can try a couple of things.

00:38:04.326 --> 00:38:05.536 A:middle
First, you can play with fast or

00:38:05.536 --> 00:38:06.986 A:middle
accurate, and you can figure out

00:38:06.986 --> 00:38:09.186 A:middle
that your particular use case

00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:10.736 A:middle
works better with a particular

00:38:10.736 --> 00:38:11.176 A:middle
algorithm.

00:38:14.956 --> 00:38:16.546 A:middle
If you're in charge of selecting

00:38:16.546 --> 00:38:18.966 A:middle
bounding box, try to find a

00:38:18.966 --> 00:38:21.486 A:middle
select salient object in the

00:38:22.636 --> 00:38:22.766 A:middle
same.

00:38:22.976 --> 00:38:23.956 A:middle
Which confidence threshold to

00:38:23.956 --> 00:38:24.236 A:middle
use?

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:26.676 A:middle
Again, there is no single answer

00:38:26.676 --> 00:38:26.936 A:middle
here.

00:38:27.266 --> 00:38:28.286 A:middle
You will find that some use

00:38:28.286 --> 00:38:29.366 A:middle
cases work with certain

00:38:29.366 --> 00:38:30.816 A:middle
thresholds while other use cases

00:38:30.816 --> 00:38:32.746 A:middle
work with other thresholds.

00:38:34.656 --> 00:38:36.106 A:middle
There's one more technique that

00:38:36.106 --> 00:38:36.836 A:middle
I could recommend.

00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:37.996 A:middle
Let's say you have a long

00:38:37.996 --> 00:38:39.086 A:middle
tracking sequence, and for the

00:38:39.086 --> 00:38:40.556 A:middle
sake of this example, 1,000

00:38:40.556 --> 00:38:40.936 A:middle
frames.

00:38:42.266 --> 00:38:43.616 A:middle
If you start that tracking

00:38:43.616 --> 00:38:45.486 A:middle
sequence, your object that you

00:38:45.486 --> 00:38:46.976 A:middle
selected in the first frame will

00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:48.236 A:middle
start deviating, and it'll

00:38:48.236 --> 00:38:50.496 A:middle
change everything about itself

00:38:50.996 --> 00:38:52.756 A:middle
the more you go off of that

00:38:52.756 --> 00:38:53.376 A:middle
initial frame.

00:38:54.356 --> 00:38:55.786 A:middle
What you can do instead, you can

00:38:55.786 --> 00:38:57.186 A:middle
break that sequence into smaller

00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.606 A:middle
subsequences, let's say 50

00:38:58.606 --> 00:38:59.136 A:middle
frames each.

00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.576 A:middle
You run your detector, you track
