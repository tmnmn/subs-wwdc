00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:01.186 A:middle
to work with by specifying

00:07:01.186 --> 00:07:02.256 A:middle
revision property of the

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:02.696 A:middle
request.

00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:04.966 A:middle
So, that's the explicit

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:05.376 A:middle
behavior.

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:06.936 A:middle
But we also have a default

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:07.376 A:middle
behavior.

00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:09.156 A:middle
If you create a request object,

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:10.566 A:middle
and you don't tell us anything

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:12.326 A:middle
at all, and you start processing

00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:13.556 A:middle
that request, here's what's

00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:14.916 A:middle
going to happen.

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:17.076 A:middle
By default, you're getting the

00:07:17.076 --> 00:07:18.956 A:middle
latest revision of the request

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:20.436 A:middle
that your app is linked

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:22.516 A:middle
against-- of the SDK that your

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:23.596 A:middle
app is linked against.

00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:25.376 A:middle
This is important to understand,

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:26.276 A:middle
and I'll give you an example.

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:28.386 A:middle
Let's say your app is linked

00:07:28.386 --> 00:07:29.546 A:middle
against there's the SDK from the

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:30.056 A:middle
last year.

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:32.306 A:middle
Last year, we had only single

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:32.746 A:middle
detector.

00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:34.406 A:middle
So, this is the detector you're

00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:36.436 A:middle
going to get, even if you take

00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:37.506 A:middle
that app and without a

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:38.676 A:middle
compilation, run it on the

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:39.366 A:middle
current OS.

00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:42.456 A:middle
If, on the other hand, you

00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:44.026 A:middle
recompile your app with the

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:45.756 A:middle
current SDK without changing a

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:47.466 A:middle
single line or coordinate, and

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:48.806 A:middle
you run it on the current OS,

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:49.986 A:middle
you're going to get by default

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:51.436 A:middle
revision #2 because this is the

00:07:51.436 --> 00:07:54.716 A:middle
way this from the current SDK.

00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:56.016 A:middle
We highly recommend you to

00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:57.646 A:middle
future-proof your apps, but

00:07:57.646 --> 00:07:58.906 A:middle
again it's exclusive to Vision.

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.246 A:middle
What you get is, first, you get
