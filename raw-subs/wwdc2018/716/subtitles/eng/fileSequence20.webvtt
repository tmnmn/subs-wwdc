00:19:58.776 --> 00:20:00.326 A:middle
calculate landmarks and populate

00:20:00.326 --> 00:20:01.036 A:middle
the landmarks field.

00:20:02.246 --> 00:20:03.726 A:middle
Now, if you look now, you will

00:20:03.726 --> 00:20:05.246 A:middle
notice that the UID in most

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.356 A:middle
cases is the same.

00:20:07.286 --> 00:20:07.796 A:middle
Why is that?

00:20:08.266 --> 00:20:09.366 A:middle
Because we're talking about the

00:20:09.366 --> 00:20:10.026 A:middle
same face.

00:20:10.026 --> 00:20:11.916 A:middle
It's the same processing step,

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:14.046 A:middle
if you will.

00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:15.526 A:middle
Where would you use implicit

00:20:15.526 --> 00:20:16.326 A:middle
versus explicit?

00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:18.516 A:middle
Well, if your application is

00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:20.566 A:middle
very simple, you would probably

00:20:20.726 --> 00:20:22.006 A:middle
want to opt for implicit way.

00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:23.046 A:middle
It's very simple.

00:20:23.046 --> 00:20:24.106 A:middle
You create a single request;

00:20:24.106 --> 00:20:25.466 A:middle
everything else is done on your

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:26.606 A:middle
behalf.

00:20:28.706 --> 00:20:30.236 A:middle
If, on the other hand, your

00:20:30.236 --> 00:20:31.686 A:middle
application is more complex, for

00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:33.106 A:middle
example, you want to process

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:35.076 A:middle
faces first, detect them, then

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:35.916 A:middle
do some filtering.

00:20:36.006 --> 00:20:37.186 A:middle
Let's say you don't care about

00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
faces on the periphery, or you

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:39.986 A:middle
want to just focus on the ones

00:20:39.986 --> 00:20:42.046 A:middle
that are in the center, you can

00:20:42.046 --> 00:20:44.026 A:middle
do that step, and then you can

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:45.576 A:middle
do landmarks on the remaining

00:20:45.576 --> 00:20:46.436 A:middle
set of faces.

00:20:47.276 --> 00:20:48.476 A:middle
In this case, you probably want

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:49.566 A:middle
to use the explicit version

00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:52.566 A:middle
because, in this case, landmarks

00:20:52.656 --> 00:20:54.236 A:middle
detector is not going to rerun

00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:54.936 A:middle
face detector inside.
