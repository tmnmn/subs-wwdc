00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:01.846 A:middle
displayed later, and I'm going

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:04.066 A:middle
to start iterating over my input

00:33:04.066 --> 00:33:05.606 A:middle
observations, which we have to.

00:33:06.396 --> 00:33:07.306 A:middle
For each one, I'm going to

00:33:07.306 --> 00:33:08.766 A:middle
create a track object request.

00:33:15.106 --> 00:33:16.676 A:middle
I'm going to advance my request

00:33:16.676 --> 00:33:17.486 A:middle
to the collection of all

00:33:17.486 --> 00:33:19.576 A:middle
requests, and we have to in this

00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:20.000 A:middle
case.

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:24.606 A:middle
Going to break off the loop, and

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:26.176 A:middle
finally, I'm ready to process my

00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:26.716 A:middle
requests.

00:33:27.346 --> 00:33:28.476 A:middle
Now, if you can see the

00:33:28.476 --> 00:33:29.676 A:middle
performed request, the perform

00:33:29.956 --> 00:33:31.986 A:middle
function accepts a collection of

00:33:31.986 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
requests.

00:33:33.206 --> 00:33:35.176 A:middle
In the slides, we only used a

00:33:35.176 --> 00:33:37.326 A:middle
single request to be passed into

00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:38.476 A:middle
that collection, but here we're

00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:39.916 A:middle
going to track two requests at

00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:40.446 A:middle
the same time.

00:33:40.876 --> 00:33:44.486 A:middle
I'm going to perform it.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:46.156 A:middle
Now, since the requests are

00:33:46.156 --> 00:33:48.186 A:middle
performed, I'm going to start

00:33:48.186 --> 00:33:49.596 A:middle
looking at the results, and I'm

00:33:49.596 --> 00:33:50.706 A:middle
going to do that by looking at

00:33:50.706 --> 00:33:52.606 A:middle
the results property of each

00:33:54.776 --> 00:33:54.896 A:middle
one.

00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:55.916 A:middle
So, I'm going to get results

00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:56.406 A:middle
property.

00:33:56.626 --> 00:33:57.876 A:middle
I'm going to get the first

00:33:57.876 --> 00:33:59.206 A:middle
object in that property because

00:33:59.206 --> 00:34:00.396 A:middle
we expect them, the single one
