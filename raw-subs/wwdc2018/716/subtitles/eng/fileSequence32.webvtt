00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:00.826 A:middle
object.

00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:09.006 A:middle
There are a couple of fields

00:32:09.006 --> 00:32:09.866 A:middle
that are important here.

00:32:10.106 --> 00:32:11.406 A:middle
This is the unique ID that we

00:32:11.406 --> 00:32:11.866 A:middle
discussed.

00:32:11.966 --> 00:32:14.236 A:middle
And then it's our bounding box

00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:15.606 A:middle
in normalize organize.

00:32:18.076 --> 00:32:19.716 A:middle
Now, if I run through, I'm going

00:32:19.716 --> 00:32:21.486 A:middle
to hit this breakpoint because

00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:23.256 A:middle
this case we're not using

00:32:23.286 --> 00:32:24.426 A:middle
[inaudible] rectangles.

00:32:26.116 --> 00:32:27.756 A:middle
This is where I create my

00:32:27.756 --> 00:32:28.726 A:middle
sequence request handler.

00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:32.126 A:middle
Now, I have my frame counter,

00:32:32.806 --> 00:32:35.276 A:middle
I have my flag if something has

00:32:35.276 --> 00:32:37.486 A:middle
failed, and I'm finally going to

00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:38.916 A:middle
start my tracking sequence.

00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:40.636 A:middle
As you can see, this is an

00:32:40.636 --> 00:32:42.006 A:middle
infinite loop, and the

00:32:42.006 --> 00:32:43.256 A:middle
conditions to get out of that

00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:44.656 A:middle
loop is if the cancellation was

00:32:44.656 --> 00:32:46.676 A:middle
requested, or if the movie has

00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:47.000 A:middle
ended.

00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:53.566 A:middle
I'm going to initialize my rect

00:32:54.976 --> 00:32:56.766 A:middle
structure to keep the

00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:57.876 A:middle
information for the graphical

00:32:57.876 --> 00:32:59.246 A:middle
user in this interface to be

00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:01.846 A:middle
displayed later, and I'm going
