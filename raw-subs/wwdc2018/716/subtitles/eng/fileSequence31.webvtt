00:31:01.016 --> 00:31:02.536 A:middle
Then, I have my bookkeeping to

00:31:02.536 --> 00:31:04.366 A:middle
be able to display results in a

00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:06.756 A:middle
graphical user interface, which

00:31:06.756 --> 00:31:09.566 A:middle
are kept in the trackedPolyRect

00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:10.186 A:middle
type.

00:31:10.776 --> 00:31:12.716 A:middle
Then, I'm going to run the

00:31:12.716 --> 00:31:14.686 A:middle
switch on the type, and the type

00:31:14.686 --> 00:31:15.766 A:middle
is something that comes from the

00:31:15.766 --> 00:31:16.896 A:middle
user interface, and in this

00:31:16.896 --> 00:31:17.816 A:middle
case, we're working with

00:31:17.996 --> 00:31:18.426 A:middle
objects.

00:31:19.856 --> 00:31:22.126 A:middle
Now, we selected two objects.

00:31:23.436 --> 00:31:24.676 A:middle
So, this is the information

00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:26.136 A:middle
coming from the user interface.

00:31:26.556 --> 00:31:27.936 A:middle
We should see these two objects

00:31:27.936 --> 00:31:28.330 A:middle
here.

00:31:32.046 --> 00:31:33.326 A:middle
Okay, there are two of them.

00:31:33.476 --> 00:31:35.656 A:middle
So, this loop will run two

00:31:35.656 --> 00:31:36.096 A:middle
times.

00:31:36.426 --> 00:31:37.676 A:middle
It will initialize input

00:31:37.676 --> 00:31:38.436 A:middle
observations.

00:31:38.716 --> 00:31:39.936 A:middle
It'll create detected object

00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:41.526 A:middle
observation as also shown in the

00:31:41.526 --> 00:31:44.766 A:middle
slides by passing bounding box

00:31:44.766 --> 00:31:44.926 A:middle
in.

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:47.556 A:middle
And we initialize our

00:31:47.556 --> 00:31:49.536 A:middle
bookkeeping structures.

00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:51.266 A:middle
Let's run it.

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.526 A:middle
Let's look at the observation

00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:00.826 A:middle
object.
