What you get is, first, you get

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:02.416 A:middle
the deterministic behavior.

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:04.846 A:middle
You know performance of the

00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:06.636 A:middle
algorithm that you're quoting

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:06.976 A:middle
against.

00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:08.356 A:middle
You know what to expect.

00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:10.526 A:middle
We also can be-- you can get

00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:12.596 A:middle
your app to be future-proof from

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:14.106 A:middle
the errors like, for example, if

00:08:14.106 --> 00:08:15.606 A:middle
we deprecate certain revision

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:16.956 A:middle
going forward, like a couple of

00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:18.766 A:middle
years from now, then you can

00:08:18.836 --> 00:08:21.186 A:middle
[inaudible]against that

00:08:22.156 --> 00:08:22.306 A:middle
[inaudible] today.

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:26.996 A:middle
Let's have a deeper dive into

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:31.916 A:middle
how to interact with Vision API.

00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:32.866 A:middle
First, we're going to look at

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:33.986 A:middle
the example with Image Request

00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:34.226 A:middle
Handler.

00:08:35.676 --> 00:08:36.716 A:middle
So, as you remember, image

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.706 A:middle
request handler is used to

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.996 A:middle
process one or more requests on

00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:40.676 A:middle
the same image.

00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:44.516 A:middle
It's optimized by caching some

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:45.446 A:middle
information like image

00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:46.956 A:middle
derivatives and request results.

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:49.206 A:middle
So, the consecutive requests

00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:50.636 A:middle
that are coming to be processed

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:52.236 A:middle
can use this information.

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:57.026 A:middle
Let's look at code sample.

00:08:57.026 --> 00:08:58.216 A:middle
Before we dive into the code

00:08:58.216 --> 00:08:59.286 A:middle
sample, I just want to emphasize

00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
a couple of points about the
