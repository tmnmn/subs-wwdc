00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:01.076 A:middle
So, what I get back?

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.626 A:middle
I get back a face observation

00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:04.116 A:middle
object, and the one of the more

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:05.496 A:middle
important fields in that object

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:06.576 A:middle
is the bounding box where the

00:10:06.576 --> 00:10:07.336 A:middle
face is located.

00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:10.836 A:middle
Let's take a look at this slide

00:10:10.836 --> 00:10:11.156 A:middle
again.

00:10:11.156 --> 00:10:12.976 A:middle
The first three lines is pretty

00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:14.446 A:middle
much all you need to find all

00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:15.426 A:middle
the faces in the image.

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:16.296 A:middle
Isn't that cool?

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:22.306 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:23.656 A:middle
Let's now take a look at the

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.246 A:middle
Sequence Request Handler.

00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:28.956 A:middle
Well, sequence request handler,

00:10:28.956 --> 00:10:29.846 A:middle
as you remember, is used to

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.726 A:middle
process a particular operation

00:10:31.726 --> 00:10:33.566 A:middle
like tracking on a sequence of

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:34.006 A:middle
frames.

00:10:35.486 --> 00:10:36.646 A:middle
Let's look at code sample, and

00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:38.406 A:middle
this code sample is pretty much

00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:40.646 A:middle
the simplest tracking sequence

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:42.246 A:middle
we can imagine with Vision API.

00:10:43.556 --> 00:10:45.056 A:middle
First, I'm going to create my

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:46.096 A:middle
Sequence Request Handler.

00:10:47.416 --> 00:10:49.116 A:middle
Then, I need to specify which

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:50.436 A:middle
object I want to track, and I'm

00:10:50.436 --> 00:10:52.126 A:middle
going to do that by creating a

00:10:52.126 --> 00:10:53.926 A:middle
detected object observation,

00:10:53.926 --> 00:10:55.536 A:middle
which gets us a parameter

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:57.496 A:middle
location, a bounding box.

00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
Then, I'm going to start my
