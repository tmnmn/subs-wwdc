00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.066 A:middle
We'll feed it into that neural

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:02.186 A:middle
network to get results for the

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:03.606 A:middle
current request, but we will

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.286 A:middle
also cache that information on

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.266 A:middle
the request handler object.

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:07.916 A:middle
So, the next request, when it

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:09.366 A:middle
comes, if it needs to use the

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:10.946 A:middle
same format, it's already there,

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:11.816 A:middle
and it doesn't need to be

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:12.356 A:middle
recomputed.

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:14.866 A:middle
We'll also cache results that we

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:16.386 A:middle
get from the requests so other

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:17.296 A:middle
requests can use it in

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:18.416 A:middle
pipelines, and we're going to

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.176 A:middle
look at pipelines going forward

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.036 A:middle
in this presentation.

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:23.636 A:middle
Let's take a look at the

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:24.536 A:middle
Sequence Request Handler.

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:26.906 A:middle
Sequence request handler is used

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:28.366 A:middle
to process a particular

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:30.626 A:middle
operation like tracking in a

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:31.566 A:middle
sequence of frames.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.256 A:middle
What it does inside, it caches

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:35.886 A:middle
the state of that operation from

00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:37.506 A:middle
frame to frame to frame for the

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:38.256 A:middle
entire sequence.

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.106 A:middle
In Vision, it's used to process

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:43.016 A:middle
tracking and image registration

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:43.476 A:middle
requests.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.516 A:middle
All other requests are processed

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:46.576 A:middle
with our Image Request Handler.

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.196 A:middle
Let's look at the results.

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:53.996 A:middle
Results in Vision coming from

00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:54.876 A:middle
observations.

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:57.186 A:middle
Observations is a collection of

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.336 A:middle
classes derived from

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:01.026 A:middle
VNObservation class.
