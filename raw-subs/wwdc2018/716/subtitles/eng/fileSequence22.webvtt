00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:00.176 A:middle
and release it right after.

00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:02.316 A:middle
Remember, it caches the image

00:22:02.386 --> 00:22:03.896 A:middle
and multiple image derivatives

00:22:03.896 --> 00:22:04.226 A:middle
inside.

00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:08.116 A:middle
The situation with sequence

00:22:08.116 --> 00:22:09.396 A:middle
request handler is very similar

00:22:09.736 --> 00:22:11.196 A:middle
with the only difference is if

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:12.526 A:middle
you release it too early, you

00:22:12.526 --> 00:22:13.536 A:middle
pretty much kill the entire

00:22:13.536 --> 00:22:14.846 A:middle
sequence because the entire

00:22:14.846 --> 00:22:18.176 A:middle
cache is gone by now.

00:22:18.406 --> 00:22:20.076 A:middle
What about requests and

00:22:20.076 --> 00:22:20.806 A:middle
observations?

00:22:21.686 --> 00:22:23.516 A:middle
Well, requests and observations

00:22:23.996 --> 00:22:25.206 A:middle
are very lightweight objects.

00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:26.656 A:middle
You can create them and release

00:22:26.656 --> 00:22:27.256 A:middle
them as needed.

00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:28.426 A:middle
There's no need to cache them.

00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:36.876 A:middle
Where should we process your

00:22:37.976 --> 00:22:38.236 A:middle
requests?

00:22:39.636 --> 00:22:41.366 A:middle
Well many requests in Vision

00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:42.856 A:middle
rely on running neural networks

00:22:42.856 --> 00:22:43.436 A:middle
on the device.

00:22:44.266 --> 00:22:45.996 A:middle
And, as we know, running neural

00:22:45.996 --> 00:22:47.616 A:middle
networks is usually faster on

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.216 A:middle
GPU versus the CPU.

00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:53.066 A:middle
So, the natural question is

00:22:53.176 --> 00:22:54.706 A:middle
where should we run it?

00:22:55.476 --> 00:22:56.756 A:middle
Here's what we do in Vision.

00:22:57.716 --> 00:22:59.636 A:middle
If request is runnable in GPU,

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:01.236 A:middle
we will try to do that first.
