00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:02.426 A:middle
So, I have the Xcode running,

00:30:02.706 --> 00:30:03.626 A:middle
and I have my headphones

00:30:03.626 --> 00:30:05.546 A:middle
connected to it, which is

00:30:05.546 --> 00:30:07.516 A:middle
running the same app as we just

00:30:07.516 --> 00:30:07.696 A:middle
saw.

00:30:08.356 --> 00:30:10.356 A:middle
I'm going to run it in the

00:30:10.356 --> 00:30:11.000 A:middle
debugger,

00:30:16.656 --> 00:30:18.446 A:middle
going to select my objects, and

00:30:19.006 --> 00:30:20.896 A:middle
it's not important what I select

00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:21.846 A:middle
because we just want to look at

00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:22.416 A:middle
the sequence.

00:30:23.396 --> 00:30:26.676 A:middle
And I'm going to run it.

00:30:26.806 --> 00:30:29.096 A:middle
So, I have a breakpoint set up

00:30:29.096 --> 00:30:30.256 A:middle
here and it breaks in the

00:30:30.256 --> 00:30:32.226 A:middle
perform tracking function, which

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:33.536 A:middle
is the most important function

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:34.056 A:middle
of this app.

00:30:34.746 --> 00:30:35.596 A:middle
That's the function that

00:30:35.596 --> 00:30:36.826 A:middle
implements the actual sequence.

00:30:37.396 --> 00:30:39.716 A:middle
Let's see what we do here.

00:30:40.466 --> 00:30:42.986 A:middle
First, we're creating our video

00:30:42.986 --> 00:30:43.236 A:middle
reader.

00:30:44.086 --> 00:30:45.216 A:middle
Then, we are reading first

00:30:45.216 --> 00:30:46.596 A:middle
frame, and we're discarding that

00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:47.836 A:middle
frame because that frame was

00:30:47.836 --> 00:30:48.916 A:middle
used to select the objects.

00:30:50.396 --> 00:30:51.436 A:middle
There's the cancellation flag

00:30:51.436 --> 00:30:51.676 A:middle
here.

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:54.256 A:middle
Then, I'm going to initialize

00:30:54.256 --> 00:30:55.686 A:middle
the collection of my input

00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:56.406 A:middle
observations.

00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:57.716 A:middle
Remember, as we saw an example

00:30:57.716 --> 00:30:58.206 A:middle
in the slides.
