00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
button.

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:04.576 A:middle
Sounds pretty good or could it

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:05.656 A:middle
be better?

00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:07.866 A:middle
Could Julian have done a better

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.196 A:middle
job and invited me a little

00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:10.976 A:middle
earlier on in the process?

00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:15.586 A:middle
I'd like to tell you a few

00:21:15.586 --> 00:21:16.906 A:middle
things about how as I a sound

00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:18.316 A:middle
designer could approach a

00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:19.256 A:middle
project like this.

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:23.066 A:middle
I'll talk about where to look

00:21:23.066 --> 00:21:25.696 A:middle
for inspiration, about designing

00:21:25.696 --> 00:21:28.456 A:middle
the sound, and some key building

00:21:28.456 --> 00:21:30.186 A:middle
blocks that we use while doing

00:21:30.186 --> 00:21:30.466 A:middle
this.

00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:34.576 A:middle
But before we dive in why do we

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:35.466 A:middle
talk about sound?

00:21:35.986 --> 00:21:39.536 A:middle
Now some of you may think our

00:21:39.536 --> 00:21:41.716 A:middle
users mute the sound on their

00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:44.296 A:middle
phone quite often, is it

00:21:44.676 --> 00:21:46.936 A:middle
important to add sound to my

00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:47.786 A:middle
app?

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:50.056 A:middle
Well of course it's up to you

00:21:50.056 --> 00:21:52.296 A:middle
but George Lucas has said that

00:21:52.296 --> 00:21:54.846 A:middle
50% of the experience of a movie

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.656 A:middle
is determined by what we hear,

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.406 A:middle
by its music and sound design.
