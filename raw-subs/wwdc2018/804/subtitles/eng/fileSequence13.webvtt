00:12:58.306 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
contact with the screen, with

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
that button.

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:04.176 A:middle
In the case of our overall toast

00:13:04.176 --> 00:13:07.246 A:middle
system we are in the middle of

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:08.726 A:middle
touching a button to request

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:09.026 A:middle
toast.

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:10.916 A:middle
So the part we're going to focus

00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.706 A:middle
on is the toaster being ready

00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:15.956 A:middle
and eventually transitioning to

00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:17.296 A:middle
the toaster making toast.

00:13:17.816 --> 00:13:20.716 A:middle
We should be thinking about what

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:22.346 A:middle
is happening and how I can hint

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:23.826 A:middle
toward what will happen.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.186 A:middle
Let's say I've begun touching

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:32.826 A:middle
this button, how do I know that

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:33.906 A:middle
I've begun tapping this button,

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:35.356 A:middle
why does it even matter?

00:13:36.426 --> 00:13:38.896 A:middle
Well, for one, the hit area of

00:13:38.896 --> 00:13:39.866 A:middle
this button might not be what

00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:41.476 A:middle
you expect, if you look closely

00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:43.456 A:middle
at the circle maybe I'm not

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.036 A:middle
quite touching it.

00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:46.796 A:middle
But perhaps the hit area is

00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:47.846 A:middle
actually a little bit larger

00:13:47.846 --> 00:13:49.866 A:middle
than the visual size, this is

00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:51.386 A:middle
particularly important for very

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:52.756 A:middle
small controls if we made that

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:53.676 A:middle
lever interactive.

00:13:57.006 --> 00:13:58.196 A:middle
So how do I know I've begun

00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:58.966 A:middle
tapping this button?

00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:02.376 A:middle
Well you might be tempted to
