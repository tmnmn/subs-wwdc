00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:02.836 A:middle
Again, within our system we're

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:05.185 A:middle
only focusing here on getting

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:07.266 A:middle
people into making toast.

00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:11.396 A:middle
So what happens when I lift my

00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:13.665 A:middle
finger from this button?

00:17:13.796 --> 00:17:15.215 A:middle
Does the unhighlight happen

00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:18.026 A:middle
immediately or is there a slight

00:17:18.026 --> 00:17:21.086 A:middle
delay so that even fast taps can

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:21.556 A:middle
be seen?

00:17:22.356 --> 00:17:23.715 A:middle
Is there a timer, does this

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:26.175 A:middle
button support double tap, if so

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.435 A:middle
I may have to wait a little bit

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:29.306 A:middle
before showing the confirmation?

00:17:29.306 --> 00:17:33.696 A:middle
If we think back to the two

00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:37.156 A:middle
types of feedback we can just

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.376 A:middle
literally tell people what is

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:39.826 A:middle
happening.

00:17:40.606 --> 00:17:42.496 A:middle
I can put some text on screen, I

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:44.296 A:middle
think it's very clear but it

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.266 A:middle
also requires reading and more

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:46.706 A:middle
text.

00:17:48.196 --> 00:17:50.536 A:middle
So maybe we can show people,

00:17:51.086 --> 00:17:53.686 A:middle
maybe the button itself provides

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:55.216 A:middle
some feedback here it's flashing

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.786 A:middle
or maybe it's something that

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
represents the action that
