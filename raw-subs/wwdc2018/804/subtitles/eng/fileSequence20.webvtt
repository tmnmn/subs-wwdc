And something I was implicitly

00:20:01.276 --> 00:20:04.326 A:middle
doing here is trying out options

00:20:04.426 --> 00:20:05.956 A:middle
to understand what's too little

00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:07.076 A:middle
and too much.

00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:08.916 A:middle
The only way I can really know

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.256 A:middle
if an animation is appropriate

00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:10.946 A:middle
or not is to try it.

00:20:16.066 --> 00:20:17.216 A:middle
So what we've done here is we've

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.346 A:middle
designed a very important part

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
of a much larger system, but I

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:24.856 A:middle
think it'll be a lot easier to

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:27.346 A:middle
figure out the flow of the rest

00:20:27.346 --> 00:20:28.566 A:middle
of this once we get this one

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:29.096 A:middle
piece right.

00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:34.106 A:middle
Now that our button is designed

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.686 A:middle
and pretty great I think we can

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
start to think about sound, so

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:39.576 A:middle
I'd like to invite Hugo up to

00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:39.906 A:middle
the stage.

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:47.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Julian.

00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:48.976 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:20:53.046 --> 00:20:56.976 A:middle
Now we can make this quick and

00:20:57.526 --> 00:20:59.646 A:middle
add a simple click sound to this

00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
button.
