00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
something unique it's not

00:28:00.286 --> 00:28:01.976 A:middle
something I'd recognize from any

00:28:01.976 --> 00:28:04.246 A:middle
other app.

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:06.626 A:middle
Okay so it looks like we're

00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:09.176 A:middle
done, at least we made our

00:28:09.176 --> 00:28:12.006 A:middle
button click but we're not done

00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:12.816 A:middle
making toast yet.

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:16.036 A:middle
So let's keep going, maybe there

00:28:16.036 --> 00:28:17.686 A:middle
are some other opportunities for

00:28:17.686 --> 00:28:19.416 A:middle
the use of sounds in this app.

00:28:19.586 --> 00:28:20.886 A:middle
Now as good sound designers we

00:28:20.886 --> 00:28:22.166 A:middle
want to tell the whole story.

00:28:23.496 --> 00:28:26.556 A:middle
So after pressing our button the

00:28:26.556 --> 00:28:27.986 A:middle
toaster heats up and we hear

00:28:27.986 --> 00:28:29.896 A:middle
this subtle buzzing sound.

00:28:30.446 --> 00:28:34.946 A:middle
Now we can -- is this helpful at

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.186 A:middle
all this sound?

00:28:36.476 --> 00:28:38.076 A:middle
Maybe, it tells us something

00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:39.986 A:middle
about the state of the device.

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:42.926 A:middle
So we can choose to play a sound

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:44.766 A:middle
that resembles this on our app

00:28:44.766 --> 00:28:46.126 A:middle
as well, maybe a continuous

00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:47.886 A:middle
sound, something like this.

00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:51.546 A:middle
[ Notification Sound ]

00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:53.436 A:middle
But making toast may take

00:28:53.436 --> 00:28:55.006 A:middle
several minutes and having this

00:28:55.006 --> 00:28:56.636 A:middle
sound play over and over again

00:28:57.276 --> 00:28:58.666 A:middle
might not be the experience

00:28:58.666 --> 00:28:59.466 A:middle
we're looking for right.
