00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.606 A:middle
I have built and rebuilt a lot

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.366 A:middle
of basic user interface elements

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.306 A:middle
like scrolling, zooming, paging,

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:08.536 A:middle
and of course buttons and I've

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:11.216 A:middle
learned a lot about the details

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:13.436 A:middle
involved in designing and

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:14.446 A:middle
building these controls.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
So I'm here to share a little

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.446 A:middle
bit about what I've learned with

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:20.766 A:middle
you.

00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:23.356 A:middle
I want to show you how something

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:27.126 A:middle
so simple, a button, has a lot

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:29.206 A:middle
of consideration and complexity

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.396 A:middle
behind it.

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.926 A:middle
And I hope that through looking

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.326 A:middle
at this button you can learn a

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:34.826 A:middle
few things.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:38.396 A:middle
I want you to use standard

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:39.676 A:middle
controls more thoughtfully.

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:43.256 A:middle
To consider when to build your

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:44.286 A:middle
own custom controls.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:46.846 A:middle
And when you do build custom

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:49.336 A:middle
controls I want you to consider

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:50.846 A:middle
your interactions all the way

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:51.216 A:middle
through.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:53.456 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.586 A:middle
Hugo and I are expanding our

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.676 A:middle
artisanal toast app empire.
