00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:00.926 A:middle
they may or may not understand.

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:05.956 A:middle
So let's apply this to our toast

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.466 A:middle
app of course.

00:09:08.636 --> 00:09:10.526 A:middle
How do I know what will happen

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.046 A:middle
when I tap this button, I just

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.616 A:middle
put a button up and call it okay

00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:14.526 A:middle
right, no.

00:09:14.696 --> 00:09:18.926 A:middle
What we do is provide a label, a

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:21.486 A:middle
label is feedback in which you

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:23.376 A:middle
are telling people literally

00:09:23.456 --> 00:09:24.436 A:middle
what is going to happen.

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:27.896 A:middle
In this particular case I tried

00:09:27.896 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
the label toast, but

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:31.176 A:middle
unfortunately toast refers to

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.946 A:middle
both the verb to toast and it

00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
also refers to the delicious

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:35.436 A:middle
piece of bread you're going to

00:09:35.436 --> 00:09:36.406 A:middle
be eating for breakfast.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:38.666 A:middle
So what should we call this

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:40.016 A:middle
label, toast toast?

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.576 A:middle
No. We could try to design an

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:47.196 A:middle
icon for this button but I think

00:09:47.196 --> 00:09:48.506 A:middle
this isn't particularly clear,

00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:49.566 A:middle
especially for something that

00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:50.876 A:middle
people will be encountering for

00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:52.586 A:middle
the first time in an unfamiliar

00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:53.116 A:middle
context.

00:09:53.866 --> 00:09:55.176 A:middle
So we thought about it a little

00:09:55.406 --> 00:09:56.366 A:middle
bit and we came up with the

00:09:56.366 --> 00:09:57.766 A:middle
phrase make toast.

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.056 A:middle
I know that in our diagram we
