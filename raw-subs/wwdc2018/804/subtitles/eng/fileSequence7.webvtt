00:06:56.836 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
feedback to three phases of an

00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:04.216 A:middle
interaction, not just its

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:04.766 A:middle
completion.

00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:07.196 A:middle
We can think of these phases in

00:07:07.196 --> 00:07:08.706 A:middle
terms of a physical button.

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:12.986 A:middle
Before I have pressed the button

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
it's just hanging out there.

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:19.446 A:middle
During my interaction with that

00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:21.346 A:middle
button it's being pressed in.

00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:26.166 A:middle
And finally after I've pressed

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.836 A:middle
that button my finger is lifting

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:28.986 A:middle
off of it and it's returning to

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:29.836 A:middle
its original state.

00:07:29.836 --> 00:07:36.036 A:middle
So what does it even mean to be

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:39.086 A:middle
providing feedback before I have

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.086 A:middle
begun interacting with a button,

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.406 A:middle
why does this even matter, the

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
button's just there right.

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:46.636 A:middle
Well if we think about our

00:07:46.636 --> 00:07:49.466 A:middle
iPhones for a moment, the iPhone

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:52.076 A:middle
screen is just a piece of glass.

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:54.446 A:middle
This piece of glass happens to

00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:56.056 A:middle
have glowing pixels underneath

00:07:56.056 --> 00:07:58.626 A:middle
it and what matters is what

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.356 A:middle
people think those pixels mean.
