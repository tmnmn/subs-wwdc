00:24:59.516 --> 00:25:02.586 A:middle
[ Buzzing Sound ]

00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:06.906 A:middle
Until our toast is done and the

00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:09.786 A:middle
toaster ejects the toast.

00:25:09.866 --> 00:25:11.256 A:middle
Now let's go through these steps

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:12.956 A:middle
one by one.

00:25:17.046 --> 00:25:18.056 A:middle
First, when we pull down the

00:25:18.056 --> 00:25:21.736 A:middle
lever we feel the resistance of

00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.096 A:middle
the spring while we push it

00:25:23.096 --> 00:25:25.496 A:middle
down, it's almost like if we

00:25:25.496 --> 00:25:26.716 A:middle
compare it to what happens in

00:25:26.716 --> 00:25:28.886 A:middle
our app it's like designing

00:25:29.316 --> 00:25:32.026 A:middle
sound haptics and animation and

00:25:32.226 --> 00:25:33.316 A:middle
synchronizing them all.

00:25:33.716 --> 00:25:35.826 A:middle
But in our app, we decided to

00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:36.806 A:middle
replace this with a simple

00:25:36.806 --> 00:25:38.736 A:middle
button so we don't need to

00:25:39.126 --> 00:25:40.216 A:middle
design a sound for it.

00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:43.616 A:middle
And when we request the toast

00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:44.496 A:middle
that is when we press our

00:25:44.496 --> 00:25:47.176 A:middle
button, the next step, and that

00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:48.596 A:middle
is what Julian asked me to

00:25:48.596 --> 00:25:50.446 A:middle
design a sound for so let's get

00:25:50.446 --> 00:25:51.856 A:middle
to work on that.

00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:57.046 A:middle
We can record sounds, we can use

00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.436 A:middle
electronic instruments,

00:25:58.606 --> 00:26:01.096 A:middle
synthesizers to generate sounds
