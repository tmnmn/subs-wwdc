00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:00.316 A:middle
These sounds though are

00:23:00.316 --> 00:23:02.546 A:middle
essentially byproducts, they're

00:23:02.546 --> 00:23:05.156 A:middle
not necessarily designed they're

00:23:05.156 --> 00:23:06.746 A:middle
defined by the materials these

00:23:06.746 --> 00:23:07.966 A:middle
buttons are made of.

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:10.766 A:middle
But because we're designed for

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:11.726 A:middle
software we have a lot of

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:15.846 A:middle
freedom, so we can choose to not

00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:18.016 A:middle
play any sounds at all and often

00:23:18.016 --> 00:23:18.926 A:middle
that is what we do.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:23.566 A:middle
But if we do decide it's useful

00:23:23.566 --> 00:23:27.026 A:middle
to add sounds to UI elements

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.126 A:middle
then we can take cues from

00:23:29.126 --> 00:23:31.666 A:middle
real-world analogs to add

00:23:31.696 --> 00:23:34.166 A:middle
meaning to these UI sounds and

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:36.106 A:middle
to help our users understand

00:23:39.236 --> 00:23:39.396 A:middle
them.

00:23:39.546 --> 00:23:40.876 A:middle
Now do you want to add sound to

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:41.246 A:middle
your app?

00:23:41.246 --> 00:23:44.086 A:middle
Well it depends, think about

00:23:44.086 --> 00:23:46.456 A:middle
category your app falls in, who

00:23:46.536 --> 00:23:48.226 A:middle
will use the app and what will

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:51.586 A:middle
their expectations be, and what

00:23:51.586 --> 00:23:52.836 A:middle
is the context, where will the

00:23:52.836 --> 00:23:53.716 A:middle
app be used.

00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:57.386 A:middle
For our app we know it will be

00:23:57.386 --> 00:23:59.256 A:middle
used by people who like to eat

00:23:59.296 --> 00:24:01.676 A:middle
toast and they're used to making
