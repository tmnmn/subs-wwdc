&gt;&gt; Hello everyone, I'm Julian,

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:36.716 A:middle
later we'll be joined by Hugo

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.956 A:middle
who designs sounds across our

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:39.516 A:middle
products.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
Before we begin I wanted to

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
explain a little bit about why

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.056 A:middle
we're going to be talking about

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.316 A:middle
a button for a while here.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:51.136 A:middle
I design and prototype user

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.896 A:middle
interfaces for future hardware.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.526 A:middle
Because of the nature of my work

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:57.256 A:middle
I can't always use standard

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:57.806 A:middle
UIKit.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.606 A:middle
I have built and rebuilt a lot
