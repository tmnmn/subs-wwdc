00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.356 A:middle
people think those pixels mean.

00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:04.166 A:middle
Glass doesn't tell you that it's

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:06.856 A:middle
tappable, but something on

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:07.396 A:middle
screen might.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:10.076 A:middle
You could see that you could

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:13.456 A:middle
page through something, drag

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:16.346 A:middle
something or of course for the

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:17.546 A:middle
purposes of this presentation

00:08:17.546 --> 00:08:18.476 A:middle
tap on something.

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:23.686 A:middle
The academic term for what I'm

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:25.416 A:middle
talking about is perceived

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:26.196 A:middle
affordance.

00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:28.766 A:middle
Affordance refers to the

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:31.716 A:middle
connection between an object and

00:08:31.746 --> 00:08:33.336 A:middle
the person interacting with it.

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:35.395 A:middle
A person might know that they

00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:37.496 A:middle
can grab a handle or press in on

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:38.296 A:middle
a physical button.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:40.525 A:middle
But the perceived part of this

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:42.876 A:middle
is talking about what people

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:45.106 A:middle
know about those glowing pixels

00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:45.766 A:middle
on screen.

00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:47.556 A:middle
People only know what they can

00:08:47.556 --> 00:08:49.036 A:middle
interact with on that iPhone

00:08:49.036 --> 00:08:50.986 A:middle
screen because of their prior

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:53.036 A:middle
experience having used iOS

00:08:53.036 --> 00:08:55.376 A:middle
before and their current

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:56.886 A:middle
context, the fact that they're

00:08:56.886 --> 00:08:59.276 A:middle
on this phone in an app that

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:00.926 A:middle
they may or may not understand.
