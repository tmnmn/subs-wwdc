00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
mind.

00:34:00.546 --> 00:34:03.826 A:middle
And that concludes what I want

00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:05.036 A:middle
to tell you about sound today,

00:34:06.056 --> 00:34:08.476 A:middle
but before we end the session

00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:11.775 A:middle
these are the most important

00:34:11.806 --> 00:34:14.065 A:middle
things that Julian and I want to

00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:16.985 A:middle
leave you with.

00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:20.166 A:middle
Details are designed even if

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:22.396 A:middle
they seem obvious, even if

00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:24.196 A:middle
they're as simple as a button,

00:34:25.206 --> 00:34:27.176 A:middle
even if they're as simple as a

00:34:27.226 --> 00:34:27.846 A:middle
click sound.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:31.686 A:middle
Now you can take inspiration

00:34:32.146 --> 00:34:35.696 A:middle
from real-world elements, but

00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:36.926 A:middle
there's no need to copy them

00:34:37.196 --> 00:34:39.005 A:middle
one-to-one.

00:34:39.186 --> 00:34:41.606 A:middle
Also use the freedom and the

00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:43.085 A:middle
flexibility of designing for

00:34:43.085 --> 00:34:44.216 A:middle
software to create something

00:34:44.216 --> 00:34:47.096 A:middle
that is completely unique and

00:34:47.096 --> 00:34:47.585 A:middle
fresh.

00:34:47.956 --> 00:34:53.136 A:middle
And then what we see, the

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:56.176 A:middle
animation, and what we feel, the

00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:58.216 A:middle
haptics, and what we hear, the

00:34:58.216 --> 00:35:00.766 A:middle
sound, they all combine into
