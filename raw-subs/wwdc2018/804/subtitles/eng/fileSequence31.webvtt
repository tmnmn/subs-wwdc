00:30:58.426 --> 00:31:00.396 A:middle
for a character, for a timbre

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:02.266 A:middle
that is friendly and it's not

00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:04.726 A:middle
too harsh or metallic.

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:09.326 A:middle
The next one is frequency or the

00:31:09.376 --> 00:31:10.236 A:middle
pitch of the sound.

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:12.656 A:middle
Some instruments play at very

00:31:12.656 --> 00:31:15.746 A:middle
high frequencies and others play

00:31:15.746 --> 00:31:17.016 A:middle
at very low frequencies.

00:31:19.456 --> 00:31:22.856 A:middle
But also nonmusical sounds can

00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:24.696 A:middle
be played at very high or low

00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:25.386 A:middle
frequencies.

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:28.106 A:middle
And when we do this it gives an

00:31:28.106 --> 00:31:31.406 A:middle
indication of the size of an

00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:31.766 A:middle
object.

00:31:32.076 --> 00:31:35.756 A:middle
So if we take our toaster and we

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:39.326 A:middle
record the toast eject sound, we

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:40.816 A:middle
play it at a very high frequency

00:31:41.116 --> 00:31:42.426 A:middle
it sounds like a tiny little

00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:42.776 A:middle
toaster.

00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
But if we take the same sound

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:49.626 A:middle
and play it at a low frequency

00:31:50.546 --> 00:31:52.556 A:middle
it sounds like this big giant

00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:52.976 A:middle
toaster.

00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:02.886 A:middle
So next up is duration or the
