00:29:58.486 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
communicates to its users, this

00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:01.966 A:middle
is the voice of our app.

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:08.316 A:middle
So now our app is in good shape.

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:10.396 A:middle
I'd like to tell you about some

00:30:10.696 --> 00:30:12.296 A:middle
key building blocks of sound

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:15.596 A:middle
that we use when designing any

00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:16.246 A:middle
kind of sound.

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:19.216 A:middle
The first one is timbre or tone

00:30:19.216 --> 00:30:19.606 A:middle
color.

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:22.876 A:middle
And most of you will instantly

00:30:23.226 --> 00:30:26.336 A:middle
recognize this one.

00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:29.366 A:middle
It's a piano right, but how do

00:30:29.366 --> 00:30:30.986 A:middle
we know it's a piano?

00:30:31.776 --> 00:30:34.206 A:middle
How do we know it's not a

00:30:34.206 --> 00:30:34.856 A:middle
vibraphone?

00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:40.706 A:middle
It's determined by the material

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:45.126 A:middle
an instrument is made of, by its

00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:47.296 A:middle
shape, and how it's being played

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.916 A:middle
using a mallet, a hammer, a bow

00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:50.816 A:middle
or your hands.

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:52.966 A:middle
So these instruments can play

00:30:52.966 --> 00:30:54.996 A:middle
exactly the same tone but sound

00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:55.916 A:middle
very different.

00:30:56.476 --> 00:30:58.426 A:middle
Now for our app we decided to go

00:30:58.426 --> 00:31:00.396 A:middle
for a character, for a timbre
