00:23:59.296 --> 00:24:01.676 A:middle
toast and they're used to making

00:24:01.676 --> 00:24:03.996 A:middle
toast in the kitchen, but from

00:24:03.996 --> 00:24:05.186 A:middle
now on they can make it from

00:24:05.186 --> 00:24:07.686 A:middle
anywhere in the house.

00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:10.026 A:middle
They can still though use the

00:24:10.026 --> 00:24:11.546 A:middle
audible cues they're used to

00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:12.656 A:middle
getting from their toaster in

00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:14.756 A:middle
the kitchen, so for that reason

00:24:15.116 --> 00:24:17.286 A:middle
we think that this app is a

00:24:17.286 --> 00:24:19.416 A:middle
perfect candidate for the use of

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:21.066 A:middle
sound.

00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:24.296 A:middle
So let's look at the process of

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:27.206 A:middle
making toast and listen to

00:24:27.206 --> 00:24:28.346 A:middle
sounds we encounter.

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.396 A:middle
Let's define if these sounds are

00:24:32.396 --> 00:24:35.046 A:middle
useful and if they are if we

00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:36.386 A:middle
want to use them in our design.

00:24:36.466 --> 00:24:39.366 A:middle
So we'll use Julian's timeline

00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:41.786 A:middle
for this and listen to the

00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:43.576 A:middle
sounds that this toaster makes.

00:24:44.856 --> 00:24:47.396 A:middle
First, we pull down the lever

00:24:48.406 --> 00:24:51.336 A:middle
and then we press it in place.

00:24:53.596 --> 00:24:55.516 A:middle
Now what we hear then is the

00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:57.286 A:middle
toaster heating up with a subtle

00:24:57.286 --> 00:24:58.736 A:middle
buzzing sound of the coil.

00:24:59.516 --> 00:25:02.586 A:middle
[ Buzzing Sound ]
