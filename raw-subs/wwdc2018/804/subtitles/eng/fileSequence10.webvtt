00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.056 A:middle
I know that in our diagram we

00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:01.576 A:middle
refer to this as request toast

00:10:01.656 --> 00:10:03.066 A:middle
but we spent some time thinking

00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:06.316 A:middle
about what people using our app

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:08.896 A:middle
might understand and what feels

00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:09.976 A:middle
most comfortable for our app.

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:15.256 A:middle
The next thing to think about is

00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:16.576 A:middle
how do I even know that this is

00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:18.566 A:middle
a button, just a rectangle

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:20.726 A:middle
floating on a black background

00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:21.646 A:middle
might not be enough.

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:24.606 A:middle
But if you add some context like

00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:27.216 A:middle
an iPhone screen you might start

00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:28.646 A:middle
to understand it or you could

00:10:28.646 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
add some prior experience.

00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:32.056 A:middle
It could be the shape of the

00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:34.966 A:middle
button, the manner in which is

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:38.136 A:middle
rendered or if it's used

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:39.726 A:middle
consistently enough just the

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:43.006 A:middle
color of text.

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.696 A:middle
In this case, I don't think

00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:46.706 A:middle
people are going to be very

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:47.736 A:middle
familiar with our app they're

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:48.826 A:middle
going to be launching it once a

00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:51.746 A:middle
day, more if we're lucky so

00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:52.886 A:middle
we're going to focus on more

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.776 A:middle
standard iOS button shapes

00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:56.036 A:middle
because we don't want to throw

00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:56.656 A:middle
in something new.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:59.546 A:middle
So we try these out on screen.
