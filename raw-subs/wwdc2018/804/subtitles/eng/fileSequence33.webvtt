00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:05.426 A:middle
Our audio engineer Mitch is

00:33:05.426 --> 00:33:06.276 A:middle
calling me from the back of the

00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:09.256 A:middle
room and I hear it loud and

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:10.006 A:middle
clear.

00:33:10.496 --> 00:33:12.226 A:middle
But if a UI sound would be loud

00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:14.236 A:middle
like this it would become

00:33:14.386 --> 00:33:15.036 A:middle
unpleasant.

00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:18.276 A:middle
It only needs add this subtle

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:19.596 A:middle
[inaudible] layer to the

00:33:19.596 --> 00:33:20.236 A:middle
interaction.

00:33:20.876 --> 00:33:22.486 A:middle
Now let's quickly reply to

00:33:22.486 --> 00:33:22.946 A:middle
Mitch.

[ Keyboard Sound ]

00:33:32.046 --> 00:33:33.796 A:middle
Now if I would miss this

00:33:33.846 --> 00:33:35.196 A:middle
keyboard sound because I'm in a

00:33:35.196 --> 00:33:37.006 A:middle
noisy environment it's not a

00:33:37.006 --> 00:33:39.046 A:middle
real big problem, but I

00:33:39.046 --> 00:33:40.736 A:middle
definitely don't want to miss my

00:33:40.736 --> 00:33:41.286 A:middle
ringtones.

00:33:43.836 --> 00:33:46.226 A:middle
So to recap the four building

00:33:46.226 --> 00:33:48.866 A:middle
blocks of sound, our timbre,

00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:52.226 A:middle
frequency, duration and

00:33:52.226 --> 00:33:52.856 A:middle
loudness.

00:33:53.346 --> 00:33:54.736 A:middle
And when you start thinking

00:33:54.736 --> 00:33:56.766 A:middle
about designing sounds and

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:58.666 A:middle
adding sounds to your app it's

00:33:58.666 --> 00:33:59.686 A:middle
really good to keep these in

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
mind.
