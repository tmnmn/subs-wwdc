00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.676 A:middle
artisanal toast app empire.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:05.446 A:middle
We are building a new simpler

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:08.346 A:middle
app that is connected to a

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:08.846 A:middle
toaster.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.966 A:middle
If you imagine for a moment

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.066 A:middle
you're getting ready in the

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.596 A:middle
morning, you want to make sure

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:17.266 A:middle
you have breakfast ready by the

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.386 A:middle
time you're heading out the

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:18.706 A:middle
door.

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:21.886 A:middle
All you have to do is launch our

00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:24.496 A:middle
app, press a button and expect a

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.316 A:middle
fresh piece of toast waiting for

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:29.486 A:middle
you in your kitchen.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.286 A:middle
Now this works with our

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:33.516 A:middle
connected toaster.

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.256 A:middle
Our connected toaster goes

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.956 A:middle
through a few different states,

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:38.886 A:middle
it's ready and waiting for a new

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:41.346 A:middle
piece of toast, it's making

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.236 A:middle
toast, and finally the toast is

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:44.176 A:middle
done, the important part.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:46.936 A:middle
But the way that our connected

00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:48.226 A:middle
toaster ends up transitioning

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
between these states is people

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:52.866 A:middle
using our app.

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:55.496 A:middle
When they use our app they can

00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:57.796 A:middle
request a piece of toast to

00:02:57.796 --> 00:02:58.876 A:middle
start the toaster going.
