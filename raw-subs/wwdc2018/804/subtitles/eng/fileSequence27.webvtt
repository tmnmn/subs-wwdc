00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:04.276 A:middle
but and now it is a sound that's

00:27:04.276 --> 00:27:06.806 A:middle
much more realistic, it doesn't

00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:08.136 A:middle
really sound like a toaster but

00:27:08.136 --> 00:27:09.206 A:middle
it does have this physical

00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.176 A:middle
quality to it.

00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:12.586 A:middle
For the same reason though it

00:27:12.586 --> 00:27:14.126 A:middle
does sound a little harsh and a

00:27:14.126 --> 00:27:15.366 A:middle
little metallic.

00:27:15.366 --> 00:27:20.006 A:middle
And then there's option C, it's

00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:25.166 A:middle
a bit of an odd one but it does

00:27:25.166 --> 00:27:27.196 A:middle
have character and it's a sound

00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:28.376 A:middle
that I would recognize if I hear

00:27:28.376 --> 00:27:32.326 A:middle
it again if I use my app again.

00:27:32.426 --> 00:27:33.346 A:middle
Another thing that's good about

00:27:33.346 --> 00:27:35.036 A:middle
this sound is that it has this

00:27:35.536 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
tonal confirmation built in,

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:38.696 A:middle
it's like throwing a checkmark

00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:40.006 A:middle
telling you your action

00:27:40.006 --> 00:27:40.546 A:middle
succeeded.

00:27:40.746 --> 00:27:41.866 A:middle
I'll play it one more time see

00:27:41.866 --> 00:27:42.606 A:middle
if you can hear this.

00:27:43.216 --> 00:27:47.306 A:middle
And for all these reasons I

00:27:47.306 --> 00:27:50.386 A:middle
think that option C is the one I

00:27:50.716 --> 00:27:53.776 A:middle
would recommend going for, it's

00:27:54.286 --> 00:27:56.506 A:middle
a simple sound, it has a

00:27:56.686 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
friendly character, and it's

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
something unique it's not
