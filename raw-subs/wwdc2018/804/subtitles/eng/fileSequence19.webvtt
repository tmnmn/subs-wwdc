00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:01.826 A:middle
bit too much, so maybe we try

00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:05.426 A:middle
that same button but separate

00:19:05.426 --> 00:19:06.446 A:middle
from our make toast button.

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.466 A:middle
This is starting to feel a bit

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:11.546 A:middle
better, so what I should do is

00:19:11.766 --> 00:19:12.826 A:middle
try it on device again.

00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:17.686 A:middle
We should see how the feedback

00:19:18.046 --> 00:19:20.206 A:middle
on the button itself connects to

00:19:20.206 --> 00:19:22.196 A:middle
the feedback from the toaster

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:24.886 A:middle
communicating what has happened.

00:19:27.996 --> 00:19:29.836 A:middle
To recap a little bit of what I

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:30.316 A:middle
went over.

00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:34.976 A:middle
Feedback is how you let people

00:19:34.976 --> 00:19:36.766 A:middle
know what it is that your app is

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:37.106 A:middle
doing.

00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:40.206 A:middle
You can literally tell people,

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:42.526 A:middle
you can put text on screen it's

00:19:42.526 --> 00:19:45.946 A:middle
fine or you can show people, you

00:19:45.946 --> 00:19:48.066 A:middle
can allow them to experience the

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:49.006 A:middle
change over time.

00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:53.416 A:middle
We can apply feedback to all

00:19:53.416 --> 00:19:55.486 A:middle
three phases of an interaction,

00:19:56.916 --> 00:19:57.836 A:middle
even a simple button.

00:19:58.376 --> 00:20:01.276 A:middle
And something I was implicitly
