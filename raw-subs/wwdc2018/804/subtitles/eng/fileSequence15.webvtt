00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:01.206 A:middle
I feel like that might be a

00:15:01.206 --> 00:15:02.606 A:middle
little bit too much for this

00:15:02.606 --> 00:15:03.676 A:middle
button though, so I'm not going

00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:04.766 A:middle
to go forward with that but I

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.326 A:middle
tried it.

00:15:07.586 --> 00:15:08.356 A:middle
Another thing that we should

00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:10.846 A:middle
think about with feedforward is

00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:12.016 A:middle
what happens if I change my

00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:14.136 A:middle
mind, let's say I'm kind of

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:15.496 A:middle
groggy in the morning, I pick up

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:17.136 A:middle
my phone I accidentally touch

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:18.906 A:middle
this button but I don't want to

00:15:18.906 --> 00:15:19.826 A:middle
start my toaster yet.

00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:22.946 A:middle
Well for most buttons I can

00:15:22.946 --> 00:15:25.056 A:middle
actually drag my finger outside

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:26.946 A:middle
of the button to begin canceling

00:15:27.556 --> 00:15:27.626 A:middle
it.

00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:29.876 A:middle
This is something that's

00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:31.476 A:middle
actually very important for all

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:33.026 A:middle
sorts of fluid interactions

00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:35.226 A:middle
because it's what makes a fluid

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.196 A:middle
interaction undecided.

00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:39.346 A:middle
If you're paging through

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.606 A:middle
different screens you don't know

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.606 A:middle
which screen it's going to end

00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:44.166 A:middle
up on until you lift your finger

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.126 A:middle
and the same thing applies to a

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:46.956 A:middle
very simple button.

00:15:46.956 --> 00:15:49.116 A:middle
I can bring my finger back

00:15:49.176 --> 00:15:51.386 A:middle
inside the button and have the

00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:52.856 A:middle
same feedforward show me that I

00:15:52.856 --> 00:15:54.116 A:middle
am now activating this button

00:15:54.116 --> 00:15:54.386 A:middle
again.

00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:59.376 A:middle
Now that we've decided a little

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:00.766 A:middle
bit about the feedforward that
