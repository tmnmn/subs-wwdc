00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:02.376 A:middle
Well you might be tempted to

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:04.126 A:middle
animate the button, to have it

00:14:04.126 --> 00:14:07.096 A:middle
fade in or grow very slowly, but

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:07.996 A:middle
this can make things feel

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:08.826 A:middle
unresponsive.

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:12.086 A:middle
This kind of animation might be

00:14:12.086 --> 00:14:13.506 A:middle
appropriate for 3-D touch if

00:14:13.506 --> 00:14:15.316 A:middle
it's responding continuously as

00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:16.026 A:middle
I'm pressing in.

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.166 A:middle
But for a quick contact with the

00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:20.766 A:middle
screen we might want to do

00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:21.936 A:middle
something faster, if we are

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:22.846 A:middle
going to animate it do it very

00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:23.206 A:middle
quickly.

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:27.096 A:middle
So what we do is provide a

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:30.056 A:middle
confirmation sound, a haptic or

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:31.076 A:middle
visual change.

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:32.696 A:middle
In this case, we're just going

00:14:32.696 --> 00:14:34.596 A:middle
to highlight it instantaneously,

00:14:35.586 --> 00:14:36.546 A:middle
make it feel a little bit

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:36.796 A:middle
faster.

00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:38.836 A:middle
This also helps us know that a

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.696 A:middle
button is enabled and that it

00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:41.306 A:middle
can work.

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:47.326 A:middle
Maybe we try connecting the

00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:49.556 A:middle
feedforward on the button to the

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:51.096 A:middle
feedforward of the toaster

00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:52.256 A:middle
itself, as I said we can start

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:53.566 A:middle
to hint toward what will happen.

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.926 A:middle
So here what I'm trying is as I

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:57.826 A:middle
touch this button maybe we show

00:14:57.826 --> 00:14:59.066 A:middle
the piece of toast starting to

00:14:59.066 --> 00:14:59.326 A:middle
appear.

00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:01.206 A:middle
I feel like that might be a
