00:34:58.216 --> 00:35:00.766 A:middle
sound, they all combine into

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:02.986 A:middle
this one single experience.

00:35:04.476 --> 00:35:07.466 A:middle
And lastly, but most

00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:10.286 A:middle
importantly, learn by trying

00:35:10.286 --> 00:35:10.836 A:middle
things out.

00:35:12.256 --> 00:35:13.576 A:middle
You know we tried out a lot of

00:35:13.576 --> 00:35:16.316 A:middle
things today and some of them

00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:18.846 A:middle
didn't work that well while

00:35:18.846 --> 00:35:19.766 A:middle
others worked great.

00:35:20.446 --> 00:35:21.916 A:middle
But the only way for us to find

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.776 A:middle
out was to try them out first.

00:35:26.256 --> 00:35:28.896 A:middle
Now I hope this all inspired you

00:35:30.096 --> 00:35:31.976 A:middle
to spend some more time on the

00:35:31.976 --> 00:35:33.916 A:middle
details you might normally take

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:34.476 A:middle
for granted.

00:35:35.936 --> 00:35:37.886 A:middle
If you get these details right

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:41.076 A:middle
it can make your apps even more

00:35:41.076 --> 00:35:41.536 A:middle
amazing.

00:35:43.036 --> 00:35:44.556 A:middle
Thank you for listening, have a

00:35:44.556 --> 00:35:44.826 A:middle
great day.
