00:22:00.516 --> 00:22:02.736 A:middle
And sound is all around us, we

00:22:02.736 --> 00:22:05.046 A:middle
use it to navigate through the

00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:05.456 A:middle
world.

00:22:07.156 --> 00:22:10.636 A:middle
And sound can help enrich the

00:22:10.636 --> 00:22:12.506 A:middle
experience of your products.

00:22:13.056 --> 00:22:16.506 A:middle
And it helps us remember the

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:19.026 A:middle
experiences of your app, as well

00:22:19.026 --> 00:22:22.976 A:middle
as your brand, so it can have a

00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:24.226 A:middle
big impact.

00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:26.676 A:middle
So where do we look for

00:22:26.676 --> 00:22:27.876 A:middle
inspiration when we want to

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:29.656 A:middle
design sound for a button?

00:22:30.366 --> 00:22:32.046 A:middle
Well we can start by taking a

00:22:32.046 --> 00:22:33.396 A:middle
little detour and looking at

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.816 A:middle
some real-world buttons.

00:22:37.076 --> 00:22:40.416 A:middle
Some of them are made of cheap

00:22:40.686 --> 00:22:42.976 A:middle
materials and sound like this,

00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:45.416 A:middle
while others are made of high

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:47.116 A:middle
quality materials and sound like

00:22:47.796 --> 00:22:47.986 A:middle
this.

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
Well this was actually a

00:22:50.356 --> 00:22:52.436 A:middle
recording of the volume button

00:22:52.486 --> 00:22:54.606 A:middle
on an iPhone X, of course we

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.306 A:middle
amplified it quite a bit.

00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:00.316 A:middle
These sounds though are
