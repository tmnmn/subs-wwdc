00:11:04.126 --> 00:11:05.426 A:middle
Another thing that we can think

00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:07.356 A:middle
about with respect to feedback

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:08.916 A:middle
before we begin using this

00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:10.636 A:middle
button is how do I even know

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.206 A:middle
what this button relates to.

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:13.856 A:middle
It could be something about

00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:15.916 A:middle
where in the app a button is

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.686 A:middle
located, these buttons have

00:11:17.686 --> 00:11:18.726 A:middle
different meaning and feel.

00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:21.696 A:middle
Or it could be something about

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:23.166 A:middle
how it's grouped with other

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.666 A:middle
controls or how close it is to

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:27.866 A:middle
other objects on screen.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.426 A:middle
I'm starting to like this last

00:11:31.426 --> 00:11:33.536 A:middle
one here so we're going to try

00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:35.086 A:middle
it out on a real screen.

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:37.096 A:middle
I drew this user interface in

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:39.106 A:middle
Keynote and I put it on a phone

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:40.826 A:middle
and I'm holding this phone in my

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:42.236 A:middle
bedroom where I might expect to

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:44.056 A:middle
use it in the morning before I

00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:44.616 A:middle
order toast.

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:45.306 A:middle
And I'm just trying to

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:48.056 A:middle
understand do I know what this

00:11:48.056 --> 00:11:48.836 A:middle
button will do.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:53.836 A:middle
The next thing we should think

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:57.096 A:middle
about is what happens during my

00:11:57.096 --> 00:11:58.316 A:middle
interaction with this button.

00:11:58.836 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
For a physical button I'd be
