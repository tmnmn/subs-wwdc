00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:02.456 A:middle
you can do something about that.

00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:04.126 A:middle
See, now with VR application it

00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:05.336 A:middle
wants to benefit from

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:06.656 A:middle
multi-sample [inaudible], it

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:08.806 A:middle
needed to use the dedicated

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:12.016 A:middle
textures per i, or single shared

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:13.666 A:middle
one, for both.

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:15.246 A:middle
But none of those layouts is

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:15.726 A:middle
perfect.

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:18.386 A:middle
The dedicated textures require

00:04:18.386 --> 00:04:20.505 A:middle
separate draw calls and passes,

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:21.846 A:middle
as we just saw.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.246 A:middle
While straight textures enable

00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:27.296 A:middle
rendering of both eyes in single

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:30.456 A:middle
rendered and results pass, they

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:32.206 A:middle
are problematic when it comes to

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:34.196 A:middle
post-processing the effects.

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:36.986 A:middle
[Inaudible] textures have all

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:38.956 A:middle
the benefits of both dedicated

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:41.556 A:middle
and shared layouts, but

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:43.026 A:middle
currently they couldn't be used

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:44.056 A:middle
with MSAA.

00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:47.506 A:middle
This was forcing app developers

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:48.826 A:middle
to use different rendering

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:50.876 A:middle
part-time layouts, based on the

00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:54.046 A:middle
fact if they wanted to use MSAA

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:54.406 A:middle
or not.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:56.716 A:middle
Or use different tricks to work

00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:57.646 A:middle
around it.

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.416 A:middle
So let's see how we can optimize

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.116 A:middle
this rendering.
