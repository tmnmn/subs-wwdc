00:28:58.746 --> 00:29:00.896 A:middle
So, the simplest way to reduce

00:29:00.896 --> 00:29:03.836 A:middle
our fill rate is to prevent our

00:29:03.836 --> 00:29:05.426 A:middle
application from rendering those

00:29:05.486 --> 00:29:07.066 A:middle
pixels that won't be visible

00:29:07.066 --> 00:29:09.616 A:middle
anyway, and you can do that

00:29:09.616 --> 00:29:12.176 A:middle
easily by using SteamVR Stencil

00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:12.946 A:middle
Mask.

00:29:14.416 --> 00:29:18.836 A:middle
So we've just saved 20% of our

00:29:18.836 --> 00:29:20.406 A:middle
fill rate by applying this

00:29:20.406 --> 00:29:22.626 A:middle
simple mask, and reduce our Vive

00:29:22.966 --> 00:29:26.806 A:middle
Pro fill rate to 620 megapixels.

00:29:29.286 --> 00:29:32.236 A:middle
Now, we will analyze implication

00:29:32.276 --> 00:29:33.776 A:middle
of this lens distortion

00:29:33.776 --> 00:29:35.326 A:middle
correction in more detail.

00:29:36.336 --> 00:29:40.836 A:middle
We will divide our field of view

00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:42.936 A:middle
into nine sections.

00:29:43.886 --> 00:29:45.986 A:middle
Central section has field of

00:29:45.986 --> 00:29:48.396 A:middle
view of 80 degrees horizontally

00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:51.276 A:middle
by 80 degrees vertically, and we

00:29:51.276 --> 00:29:53.206 A:middle
have surrounding sections on the

00:29:53.266 --> 00:29:54.396 A:middle
edges and corners.

00:29:55.306 --> 00:29:57.596 A:middle
We've color tinted them to

00:29:57.596 --> 00:29:58.956 A:middle
better visualize the

00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:00.726 A:middle
contribution to final image.
