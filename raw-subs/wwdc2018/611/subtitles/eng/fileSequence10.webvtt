00:09:59.396 --> 00:10:03.326 A:middle
And of course, sharing Metal

00:10:03.326 --> 00:10:05.266 A:middle
textures between application and

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:06.806 A:middle
compositor is not the only use

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.026 A:middle
case for shareable Metal

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:08.636 A:middle
textures.

00:10:09.436 --> 00:10:11.126 A:middle
So here we have simple example

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:12.506 A:middle
of how you can pass Metal

00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:14.156 A:middle
texture between any two

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:14.956 A:middle
processes.

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:17.526 A:middle
So we start exactly in the same

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:17.766 A:middle
way.

00:10:18.046 --> 00:10:19.326 A:middle
We create our shareable Metal

00:10:19.326 --> 00:10:23.206 A:middle
texture, but now from this

00:10:23.286 --> 00:10:25.136 A:middle
texture, we create special

00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:27.456 A:middle
shared texture handle that can

00:10:27.456 --> 00:10:29.726 A:middle
be passed between process spaces

00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:31.176 A:middle
using cross-process

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:32.556 A:middle
communication connection.

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.056 A:middle
Once this handle is passed to

00:10:36.056 --> 00:10:39.306 A:middle
other process, it can be used to

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.496 A:middle
recreate texture object.

00:10:42.346 --> 00:10:44.906 A:middle
But while doing that, you need

00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:46.936 A:middle
to remember to recreate your

00:10:47.016 --> 00:10:49.096 A:middle
texture object on exactly the

00:10:49.096 --> 00:10:51.616 A:middle
same device as it was originally

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:53.326 A:middle
created in other process space,

00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:56.176 A:middle
as this texture cannot leave

00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:57.666 A:middle
scope of GPU.

00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:02.476 A:middle
So now let's get back to our
