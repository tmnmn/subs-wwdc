00:22:59.146 --> 00:23:01.396 A:middle
encoding brief operation that

00:23:01.396 --> 00:23:03.736 A:middle
will transfer those results to

00:23:03.736 --> 00:23:05.806 A:middle
system memory that is visible by

00:23:05.806 --> 00:23:06.676 A:middle
both GPUs.

00:23:07.426 --> 00:23:08.786 A:middle
And once this transfer is

00:23:08.786 --> 00:23:12.436 A:middle
complete, our supporting GPU can

00:23:12.906 --> 00:23:15.216 A:middle
safely signal our shared event.

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:18.256 A:middle
This signal will tell eGPU that

00:23:18.316 --> 00:23:19.846 A:middle
now it's safe to take those

00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:20.236 A:middle
results.

00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:23.536 A:middle
So our rendering thread

00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:24.576 A:middle
committed this [inaudible]

00:23:24.576 --> 00:23:26.886 A:middle
common buffer, and supporting

00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:28.946 A:middle
GPU is already processing its

00:23:28.946 --> 00:23:29.246 A:middle
work.

00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:32.336 A:middle
At the same time, we can start

00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:34.086 A:middle
encoding command buffer for a

00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:36.026 A:middle
primary GPU that is driving the

00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:36.486 A:middle
headset.

00:23:37.676 --> 00:23:39.356 A:middle
In this command buffer, we will

00:23:39.356 --> 00:23:41.626 A:middle
start by waiting for our shared

00:23:41.626 --> 00:23:43.446 A:middle
event to be sure that the data

00:23:43.446 --> 00:23:45.516 A:middle
is in system memory, and once

00:23:45.516 --> 00:23:47.426 A:middle
it's there, and the shared event

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:50.066 A:middle
is signaled, we can perform a

00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:51.306 A:middle
brief operation that will

00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:52.516 A:middle
transfer this data through

00:23:52.516 --> 00:23:54.826 A:middle
Thunderbolt 3 connection, back

00:23:55.096 --> 00:23:57.856 A:middle
to our [inaudible] GPU and once

00:23:57.956 --> 00:23:59.856 A:middle
this transfer is complete, it's

00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.936 A:middle
safe to perform pause-dependent
