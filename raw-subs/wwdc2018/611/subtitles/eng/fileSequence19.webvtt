00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:01.346 A:middle
was waiting for pauses to encode

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:02.996 A:middle
any type of work to GPU.

00:19:03.626 --> 00:19:05.336 A:middle
But if we split those workloads

00:19:05.336 --> 00:19:08.636 A:middle
in half, we can encode pause

00:19:08.636 --> 00:19:09.676 A:middle
independent workloads

00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:11.936 A:middle
immediately and then wait for

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.046 A:middle
pauses to continue with encoding

00:19:14.146 --> 00:19:15.156 A:middle
pause-dependent ones.

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:19.456 A:middle
In this slide, we've already

00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:21.076 A:middle
separated pause independent

00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:23.006 A:middle
workloads from pause dependent

00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:23.346 A:middle
ones.

00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:26.096 A:middle
Pause independent workloads is

00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:27.346 A:middle
now encoded in [inaudible]

00:19:27.496 --> 00:19:29.096 A:middle
common buffer, and is marked

00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:31.066 A:middle
with a little bit darker shade

00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:32.746 A:middle
than pause-dependent workload

00:19:32.746 --> 00:19:33.446 A:middle
following it.

00:19:34.336 --> 00:19:35.666 A:middle
Because pause-independent

00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:36.886 A:middle
workload can be encoded

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:39.146 A:middle
immediately, we will do exactly

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:39.376 A:middle
that.

00:19:39.966 --> 00:19:41.526 A:middle
We will encode it as soon as the

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.796 A:middle
previous frame workload is

00:19:42.796 --> 00:19:43.286 A:middle
encoded.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.866 A:middle
This gives CPU more time to

00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:49.246 A:middle
encode the GPU work, and what is

00:19:49.416 --> 00:19:51.646 A:middle
even more important, it ensures

00:19:51.646 --> 00:19:54.196 A:middle
us that this GPU work is already

00:19:54.196 --> 00:19:56.556 A:middle
waiting for being executed on

00:19:56.556 --> 00:19:59.336 A:middle
GPU so there will be exactly no

00:19:59.336 --> 00:20:00.576 A:middle
idle time on GPU.
