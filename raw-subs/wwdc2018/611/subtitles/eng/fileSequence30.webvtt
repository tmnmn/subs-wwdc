00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:00.726 A:middle
contribution to final image.

00:30:01.306 --> 00:30:05.196 A:middle
So as you can see, corners are

00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:08.236 A:middle
almost completely invisible and

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:11.786 A:middle
edges have matched less

00:30:11.786 --> 00:30:13.596 A:middle
contribution to the image than

00:30:13.626 --> 00:30:14.696 A:middle
in the original one.

00:30:15.486 --> 00:30:17.996 A:middle
In fact, if you see this image

00:30:17.996 --> 00:30:19.996 A:middle
in the headset, you wouldn't be

00:30:20.066 --> 00:30:22.616 A:middle
able to look directly at the red

00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:23.346 A:middle
sections.

00:30:24.126 --> 00:30:25.846 A:middle
The only way to see them would

00:30:25.846 --> 00:30:27.366 A:middle
be with your peripheral vision.

00:30:28.886 --> 00:30:31.666 A:middle
So this gives us great hint.

00:30:33.306 --> 00:30:35.186 A:middle
We can render those edge and

00:30:35.236 --> 00:30:37.626 A:middle
corner sections and a reduced

00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:40.086 A:middle
fill rate, as they are mostly

00:30:40.086 --> 00:30:41.046 A:middle
invisible anyway.

00:30:42.276 --> 00:30:45.056 A:middle
We render the central section as

00:30:45.056 --> 00:30:45.956 A:middle
we did before.

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.046 A:middle
But then we will render vertical

00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:51.856 A:middle
edges with half of the width and

00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:53.946 A:middle
horizontal sections with half of

00:30:53.976 --> 00:30:54.686 A:middle
the height.

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.966 A:middle
And finally, we will render

00:30:57.026 --> 00:31:00.306 A:middle
corner edges at one-fourth of
