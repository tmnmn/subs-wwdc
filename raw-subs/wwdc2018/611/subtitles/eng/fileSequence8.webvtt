00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
textures can be created.

00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:03.906 A:middle
Because shareable textures

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:06.316 A:middle
allows us now to pass complex

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:08.296 A:middle
textures between processes, we

00:08:08.296 --> 00:08:10.676 A:middle
will create 2D array texture

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:12.006 A:middle
that we will pass to VR

00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:12.936 A:middle
compositor.

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:16.116 A:middle
As you can see, to do that, we

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:18.126 A:middle
use new methods, new shared

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.426 A:middle
texture with this creator.

00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:22.986 A:middle
And while doing that, you need

00:08:23.056 --> 00:08:24.926 A:middle
to remember to use private

00:08:25.096 --> 00:08:27.036 A:middle
storage mode, as this texture

00:08:27.036 --> 00:08:29.286 A:middle
can be only accessed by the GPU

00:08:29.706 --> 00:08:33.126 A:middle
on which it was created.

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.996 A:middle
Now, we see a code snippet

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:38.546 A:middle
showing us how our VR

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:41.416 A:middle
application would send IOSurface

00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:44.186 A:middle
to VR compositor in the past.

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:45.526 A:middle
We will now go through this code

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.656 A:middle
snippet, and see what changes

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:50.676 A:middle
needs to be applied to switch

00:08:50.676 --> 00:08:52.656 A:middle
from using IOSurfaces to shared

00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:53.516 A:middle
Metal textures.

00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:56.166 A:middle
So we don't need those two

00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:59.366 A:middle
IOSurfaces anymore, and those

00:08:59.426 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
two textures that were backed by
