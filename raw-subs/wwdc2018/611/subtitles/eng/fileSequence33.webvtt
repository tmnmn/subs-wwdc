00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:02.116 A:middle
rate, lower regions, that will

00:33:02.446 --> 00:33:03.966 A:middle
reduce fill rate even more.

00:33:04.846 --> 00:33:07.206 A:middle
In case of 55 by 55 degrees

00:33:07.206 --> 00:33:10.446 A:middle
central region, 80% of your

00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:12.536 A:middle
[inaudible] eye movement will be

00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:15.546 A:middle
still inside this region, but

00:33:15.546 --> 00:33:17.426 A:middle
we've reduced our fill rate by

00:33:17.426 --> 00:33:20.016 A:middle
more than half, to 360

00:33:20.146 --> 00:33:23.476 A:middle
megapixels per second.

00:33:23.696 --> 00:33:25.116 A:middle
So of course there are different

00:33:25.116 --> 00:33:26.316 A:middle
ways to implement

00:33:26.366 --> 00:33:29.446 A:middle
multi-resolution shading.

00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:32.326 A:middle
And you will get different

00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:34.626 A:middle
performance gains from that.

00:33:34.816 --> 00:33:36.366 A:middle
So I encourage you to experiment

00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:37.966 A:middle
with this technique and try what

00:33:38.006 --> 00:33:39.446 A:middle
will work for you best.

00:33:41.546 --> 00:33:42.926 A:middle
So let's summarize everything

00:33:42.926 --> 00:33:44.316 A:middle
that we've learned during this

00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:46.986 A:middle
session.

00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:48.676 A:middle
We've just announced plug and

00:33:48.716 --> 00:33:50.446 A:middle
play support for Vive Pro

00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:53.526 A:middle
Headsets, and introduced new

00:33:53.526 --> 00:33:55.256 A:middle
Metal 2 features that allow you

00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:57.306 A:middle
now to develop even more

00:33:57.306 --> 00:33:58.916 A:middle
advanced VR applications.

00:33:59.726 --> 00:34:01.486 A:middle
And I encourage you to take
