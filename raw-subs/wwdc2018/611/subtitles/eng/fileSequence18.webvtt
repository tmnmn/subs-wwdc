00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:00.056 A:middle
So [inaudible] application is

00:18:00.056 --> 00:18:01.846 A:middle
already very good example of

00:18:01.846 --> 00:18:03.966 A:middle
your application, but there are

00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:05.446 A:middle
still few things we can do.

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:09.396 A:middle
If you will notice, rendering

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.626 A:middle
thread is still waiting with

00:18:11.696 --> 00:18:13.786 A:middle
encoding of any type of GPU work

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:16.326 A:middle
before it will receive predicted

00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:16.876 A:middle
pauses.

00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:19.186 A:middle
But not all [inaudible] in the

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:21.486 A:middle
frame requires those pauses.

00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:24.766 A:middle
So let's analyze in more detail

00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:26.086 A:middle
to pick our frame workloads.

00:18:27.486 --> 00:18:29.956 A:middle
Here, you can see a list of

00:18:30.006 --> 00:18:31.896 A:middle
workloads that may be executed

00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:32.916 A:middle
in each frame.

00:18:34.056 --> 00:18:35.656 A:middle
Part of them happen in screen

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.696 A:middle
space or require general

00:18:37.696 --> 00:18:39.766 A:middle
knowledge about pause for which

00:18:39.766 --> 00:18:40.736 A:middle
frame is rendered.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:42.726 A:middle
We call such workloads

00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:44.116 A:middle
pause-dependent ones.

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:46.506 A:middle
At the same time, there are

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:48.746 A:middle
workloads that are generic and

00:18:48.746 --> 00:18:50.056 A:middle
can be executed without

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:51.326 A:middle
knowledge about pauses

00:18:51.326 --> 00:18:51.996 A:middle
immediately.

00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:54.886 A:middle
We call those workloads pause

00:18:54.886 --> 00:18:55.886 A:middle
independent ones.

00:18:56.496 --> 00:18:59.306 A:middle
So currently, our application

00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:01.346 A:middle
was waiting for pauses to encode
