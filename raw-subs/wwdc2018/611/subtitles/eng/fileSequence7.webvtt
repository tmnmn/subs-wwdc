application shares textures with

00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:01.746 A:middle
compositor.

00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:04.676 A:middle
So now, for sharing textures, we

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:05.826 A:middle
use IOSurfaces.

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:08.316 A:middle
They are sharing textures

00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:10.086 A:middle
between different process spaces

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:14.086 A:middle
and different GPUs, that we've

00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:15.466 A:middle
got [inaudible] comes a price.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.466 A:middle
IOSurfaces can be only used to

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:22.316 A:middle
share simple 2D textures, so if

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:23.876 A:middle
you have a multi-sampled one,

00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:25.996 A:middle
storing [inaudible] or having

00:07:26.806 --> 00:07:27.386 A:middle
[inaudible], they couldn't be

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:27.736 A:middle
shared.

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:30.706 A:middle
That's why today we introduce

00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:32.836 A:middle
shareable Metal textures that

00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:34.676 A:middle
allow your applications to share

00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:36.486 A:middle
any type of Metal texture

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:39.736 A:middle
between process spaces, as long

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:42.046 A:middle
as these textures stay in scope

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:43.106 A:middle
of single GPU.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.726 A:middle
This file features [inaudible]

00:07:46.856 --> 00:07:49.116 A:middle
advanced view of these cases.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.956 A:middle
For example, sharing depth of

00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:53.946 A:middle
your scene with VR compositor.

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:55.846 A:middle
But, of course, it's not limited

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:56.446 A:middle
just to that.

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.016 A:middle
Now, let's look how those

00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
textures can be created.
