00:31:59.176 --> 00:32:01.246 A:middle
techniques, your application can

00:32:01.246 --> 00:32:03.536 A:middle
render to Vive Pro with much

00:32:03.536 --> 00:32:05.796 A:middle
higher resolution using exactly

00:32:05.796 --> 00:32:08.386 A:middle
the same GPU as it did when

00:32:08.386 --> 00:32:09.796 A:middle
rendering to Vive headset.

00:32:10.816 --> 00:32:12.486 A:middle
Of course, you can use those

00:32:12.556 --> 00:32:13.626 A:middle
techniques when rendering to

00:32:13.626 --> 00:32:15.346 A:middle
Vive as well, which will allow

00:32:15.346 --> 00:32:17.306 A:middle
you to bring visualize of your

00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:19.386 A:middle
application even further and

00:32:20.106 --> 00:32:21.046 A:middle
make it prettier.

00:32:21.626 --> 00:32:25.306 A:middle
There is one caveat here.

00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:27.166 A:middle
Multi-resolution shading

00:32:27.296 --> 00:32:30.356 A:middle
requires few render passes, so

00:32:30.356 --> 00:32:34.006 A:middle
it will increase your workload

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:36.356 A:middle
on geometric [inaudible], but

00:32:36.356 --> 00:32:38.466 A:middle
you can easily mitigate that by

00:32:38.516 --> 00:32:39.996 A:middle
just reducing your central

00:32:39.996 --> 00:32:41.746 A:middle
vision by a few degrees.

00:32:42.556 --> 00:32:44.036 A:middle
Here, by just reducing our

00:32:44.036 --> 00:32:45.996 A:middle
central vision by 10 degrees,

00:32:46.486 --> 00:32:48.026 A:middle
we've reduced fill rate all the

00:32:48.026 --> 00:32:50.346 A:middle
way to 382 megapixels per

00:32:50.346 --> 00:32:50.826 A:middle
second.

00:32:51.546 --> 00:32:53.956 A:middle
And if your geometry workload is

00:32:53.956 --> 00:32:56.606 A:middle
really high, you can go further,

00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:59.146 A:middle
and experiment with lower fill

00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:02.116 A:middle
rate, lower regions, that will
