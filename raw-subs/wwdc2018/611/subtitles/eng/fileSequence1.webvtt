equipped with [inaudible] based

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.636 A:middle
GPUs and have up to 80 gigabytes

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:06.976 A:middle
of video memory on board.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:09.946 A:middle
While iMac Pro are equipped with

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:11.786 A:middle
even more advanced and even

bigger based GPUs, with up to 16

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:15.586 A:middle
gigabytes of video memory.

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:18.636 A:middle
That's a lot of power that is

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:19.536 A:middle
now in your hands.

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:21.516 A:middle
But we are not limiting our

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:23.406 A:middle

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.976 A:middle
With recent announcement of

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.456 A:middle
extended GPU support, you can

now turn any Mac into powerful

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:34.376 A:middle
workstation that gives you more

than 10 [inaudible] of

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:36.376 A:middle
processing power.

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:37.886 A:middle
And that's not all.

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:40.786 A:middle
Today we are introducing plug

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:43.276 A:middle
and play support for HTC Vive
