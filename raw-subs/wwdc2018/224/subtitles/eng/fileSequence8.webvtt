00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.056 A:middle
request and a context for our

00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:02.656 A:middle
view controller, but before we

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.136 A:middle
smash them together to get our

00:08:04.136 --> 00:08:05.486 A:middle
results, we should configure the

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:06.746 A:middle
fetch request a little bit more

00:08:06.746 --> 00:08:07.986 A:middle
to make sure that our controller

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:09.136 A:middle
will have great performance.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:12.276 A:middle
Sometimes it makes sense to set

00:08:12.276 --> 00:08:13.806 A:middle
a fetch limit, but in the case

00:08:13.806 --> 00:08:15.036 A:middle
of our list view, batching makes

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.036 A:middle
more sense because we want to

00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:18.596 A:middle
show all the data and we know

00:08:18.596 --> 00:08:20.126 A:middle
exactly how many cells our view

00:08:20.126 --> 00:08:21.296 A:middle
controller can fit on the screen

00:08:21.296 --> 00:08:21.806 A:middle
at once.

00:08:22.546 --> 00:08:24.306 A:middle
In general, at least one of

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:25.886 A:middle
these options should always be

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.156 A:middle
set for fetch requests that

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:28.586 A:middle
might return an unbounded number

00:08:28.586 --> 00:08:29.276 A:middle
of results.

00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:32.346 A:middle
So, at this point, we could turn

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.676 A:middle
our fetch request into objects

00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:35.025 A:middle
and populate a list view with

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.196 A:middle
the results, but what if we want

00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:39.155 A:middle
to keep the UI up to date with

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.366 A:middle
changes as they happen?

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:42.846 A:middle
Core Data has us covered here as

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:43.756 A:middle
well with the fetched results

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.246 A:middle
controller.

00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:46.356 A:middle
Available on all platforms since

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:47.976 A:middle
Sierra, adopting the fetched

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:49.366 A:middle
results controller just requires

00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:50.556 A:middle
writing an adaptor between the

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:51.886 A:middle
delegate protocol and the view

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:52.536 A:middle
it's driving.

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:54.556 A:middle
And to create one, all we need

00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:55.296 A:middle
is a fetch request and a

00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:55.836 A:middle
context.

00:08:57.176 --> 00:08:58.136 A:middle
The fetched results controller

00:08:58.136 --> 00:08:59.276 A:middle
even supports driving more

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.316 A:middle
advanced list view concepts such
