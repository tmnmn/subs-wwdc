00:32:59.696 --> 00:33:01.196 A:middle
So, you'll need to take care to

00:33:01.196 --> 00:33:02.836 A:middle
analyze whether or not you're

00:33:02.836 --> 00:33:04.226 A:middle
actually testing the teardown

00:33:04.226 --> 00:33:05.256 A:middle
performance or the setup

00:33:05.256 --> 00:33:06.946 A:middle
performance or the actual

00:33:06.946 --> 00:33:08.216 A:middle
runtime performance of the

00:33:08.216 --> 00:33:09.626 A:middle
queries you're evaluating.

00:33:10.556 --> 00:33:11.546 A:middle
And after you've run these

00:33:11.546 --> 00:33:14.046 A:middle
tests, you can file good bugs.

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:17.346 A:middle
We love bugs, especially from

00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:18.546 A:middle
you guys because we're building

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:19.796 A:middle
a product to help you build your

00:33:19.796 --> 00:33:20.606 A:middle
applications.

00:33:21.206 --> 00:33:24.176 A:middle
But, bug reports without tests

00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:25.426 A:middle
or without a sample application

00:33:25.426 --> 00:33:26.486 A:middle
are very hard for us to

00:33:26.486 --> 00:33:28.126 A:middle
communicate around because, as I

00:33:28.126 --> 00:33:29.906 A:middle
mentioned earlier, they don't

00:33:29.906 --> 00:33:30.696 A:middle
capture your product

00:33:30.696 --> 00:33:32.196 A:middle
requirements and expectations in

00:33:32.196 --> 00:33:33.046 A:middle
the same way that

00:33:33.046 --> 00:33:34.396 A:middle
well-structured tests do.

00:33:35.206 --> 00:33:37.366 A:middle
In fact, in an application

00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:39.716 A:middle
attached to our radar that has a

00:33:39.716 --> 00:33:41.756 A:middle
test suite or even just a bare

00:33:41.756 --> 00:33:43.526 A:middle
sample application with some UI

00:33:44.086 --> 00:33:46.186 A:middle
that explains your constraints

00:33:46.406 --> 00:33:48.436 A:middle
and concerns to us, we can get

00:33:48.436 --> 00:33:50.076 A:middle
back to you much more rapidly

00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:51.886 A:middle
about what's going on and what

00:33:51.886 --> 00:33:52.706 A:middle
you should do about it.

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:55.106 A:middle
They also help us verify the

00:33:55.106 --> 00:33:56.616 A:middle
correctness of our fixes later.

00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:58.226 A:middle
So, if you're going to file a

00:33:58.226 --> 00:34:00.806 A:middle
bug, please take some time and
