00:30:59.596 --> 00:31:00.756 A:middle
memory, if you have a lot of

00:31:00.756 --> 00:31:02.186 A:middle
data, this will cause a lot of

00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:03.536 A:middle
memory growth in your test

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:04.146 A:middle
suite.

00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:09.476 A:middle
You should have at least one

00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:11.676 A:middle
test, though, that actually

00:31:11.676 --> 00:31:13.146 A:middle
materializes your store file on

00:31:13.146 --> 00:31:13.506 A:middle
disk.

00:31:14.026 --> 00:31:15.746 A:middle
And this is because if you can't

00:31:15.746 --> 00:31:16.806 A:middle
open your store for your test

00:31:16.806 --> 00:31:18.316 A:middle
suite, it's highly likely that

00:31:18.316 --> 00:31:19.436 A:middle
your customer can't either.

00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:22.546 A:middle
If your persistent container is

00:31:22.546 --> 00:31:24.156 A:middle
in the application delegate, you

00:31:24.156 --> 00:31:25.506 A:middle
can have a test base class that

00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:26.866 A:middle
grabs the container out and

00:31:26.866 --> 00:31:28.506 A:middle
writes directly to that store.

00:31:29.296 --> 00:31:31.496 A:middle
But I must caution you to take

00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:33.086 A:middle
care when you do this, because

00:31:33.086 --> 00:31:34.106 A:middle
that means that you're writing

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:35.566 A:middle
to the store file that's in use

00:31:35.566 --> 00:31:37.776 A:middle
by the application, so if you

00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:38.916 A:middle
run your test on a personal

00:31:38.916 --> 00:31:40.646 A:middle
device, you'll see the effects

00:31:40.646 --> 00:31:42.006 A:middle
of the unit test when you open

00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
your application the next time.

00:31:47.536 --> 00:31:48.446 A:middle
What if I told you I could

00:31:48.446 --> 00:31:50.316 A:middle
insert 100,000 records in just

00:31:50.316 --> 00:31:51.236 A:middle
seven lines of code?

00:31:53.806 --> 00:31:55.036 A:middle
I'm cheating a little bit.

00:31:55.036 --> 00:31:56.356 A:middle
I was going to leave this as an

00:31:56.356 --> 00:31:58.556 A:middle
exercise to the reader, but this

00:31:58.556 --> 00:31:59.946 A:middle
type of scaffolding is a great

00:31:59.946 --> 00:32:01.306 A:middle
way to help you build a test
