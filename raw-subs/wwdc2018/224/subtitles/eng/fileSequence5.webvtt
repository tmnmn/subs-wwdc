00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:00.366 A:middle
directory.

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:02.056 A:middle
That was great when our model

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:04.066 A:middle
code was part of the app, but we

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:04.876 A:middle
should try to keep our new

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:06.116 A:middle
frameworks files from mingling

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:07.286 A:middle
too much with the apps.

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.566 A:middle
Since we already subclassed

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:10.976 A:middle
NSPersistentContainer to make

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.706 A:middle
finding the model easier, let's

00:05:12.706 --> 00:05:14.086 A:middle
build on that to improve this.

00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:18.456 A:middle
The brute force way to change a

00:05:18.456 --> 00:05:20.786 A:middle
store's location is to directly

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.156 A:middle
modify the URL in the

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.446 A:middle
persistentStoreDescription

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:24.586 A:middle
before loading the store.

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:26.716 A:middle
Sometimes that's what you want

00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:27.826 A:middle
and we could use that pattern

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.406 A:middle
here, but we don't have to

00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.516 A:middle
because NSPersistentContainer

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:33.996 A:middle
calls its own default directory

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.816 A:middle
URL method when creating

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:37.086 A:middle
persistent store descriptions.

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:38.626 A:middle
And it's made to be overridden.

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:40.516 A:middle
In this case, we can just append

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:42.066 A:middle
a path component, but this is

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:43.076 A:middle
also a good way to set up

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:45.776 A:middle
containers for caches or other

00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:46.826 A:middle
kinds of stacks that need to

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:47.926 A:middle
keep their stores in different

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.756 A:middle
locations, like your tasks.

00:05:50.306 --> 00:05:53.046 A:middle
So, now that we've got our Core

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:54.256 A:middle
Data stock all figured out,

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:55.686 A:middle
let's have a look at our app and

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.116 A:middle
some of the view controllers

00:05:57.116 --> 00:05:57.706 A:middle
that we've written.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:05:59.926 A:middle
It looks like we've got some

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:00.896 A:middle
pretty specialized view
