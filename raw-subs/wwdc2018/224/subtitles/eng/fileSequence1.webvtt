Then, Nick is going to talk

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.946 A:middle
about a few ways our app can

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:03.226 A:middle
maintain its performance, even

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:04.726 A:middle
as it scales beyond our wildest

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:07.666 A:middle
dreams, and we'll wrap up with

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:09.196 A:middle
some good stuff about

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:10.646 A:middle
transformers, debugging, and

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:11.046 A:middle
testing.

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:15.976 A:middle
But first, let's build an app.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.716 A:middle
I like to take photos, so we're

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:18.416 A:middle
going to build something that

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:19.486 A:middle
allows me to share photos with

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:21.746 A:middle
friends and get comments from

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:22.946 A:middle
them, even if it's just Nick

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:25.316 A:middle
asking how my slides are going.

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:28.026 A:middle
Where should we keep our app's

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:28.406 A:middle
data?

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:30.016 A:middle
Well, we could keep it all

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:31.456 A:middle
online, but I usually take

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:32.776 A:middle
photos when I'm traveling, and

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:33.696 A:middle
the connection can be kind of

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:35.756 A:middle
spotty, so we should keep it

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:37.046 A:middle
locally, organized into some

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:37.736 A:middle
kind of store.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:42.596 A:middle
So, we have posts and comments

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:44.006 A:middle
and their instances and the

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.606 A:middle
relationships between them form

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.386 A:middle
an object graph and we've

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:48.846 A:middle
decided we need to persist these

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:52.316 A:middle
things on disk, so that's what

00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:53.096 A:middle
Core Data is for.

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:57.236 A:middle
So, we'll use that and we'll

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:59.166 A:middle
start by translating our mock

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
here into something a store can
