00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.366 A:middle
it by creating a covering index.

00:27:01.366 --> 00:27:02.606 A:middle
And we can do this in the model

00:27:02.606 --> 00:27:05.256 A:middle
editor by adding a fetch index

00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:06.416 A:middle
to our post entity.

00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:08.416 A:middle
Here I've configured it to run

00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:10.216 A:middle
on the timestamp and fetch them

00:27:10.216 --> 00:27:12.676 A:middle
out in descending order because

00:27:12.676 --> 00:27:13.786 A:middle
we're showing the most recent

00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:15.306 A:middle
posts at the top of the table

00:27:15.306 --> 00:27:15.526 A:middle
view.

00:27:17.676 --> 00:27:19.106 A:middle
When we run the application

00:27:19.106 --> 00:27:20.586 A:middle
again, we see the same select

00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:20.976 A:middle
logs.

00:27:24.386 --> 00:27:26.546 A:middle
Except that this time we see

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:27.876 A:middle
that the select query hits the

00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:29.616 A:middle
covering index during the query.

00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:31.726 A:middle
Explain shows us that the query

00:27:31.726 --> 00:27:33.746 A:middle
will use the covering index for

00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:38.296 A:middle
its order by.

00:27:38.536 --> 00:27:39.966 A:middle
Core Data supports many types of

00:27:39.966 --> 00:27:41.696 A:middle
indexing, including compound

00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:43.356 A:middle
indexes using R-trees.

00:27:43.906 --> 00:27:45.646 A:middle
And these are great for creating

00:27:45.646 --> 00:27:47.346 A:middle
any kind of query or optimizing

00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:49.806 A:middle
a query that uses a bounding box

00:27:50.406 --> 00:27:51.536 A:middle
in its select statement.

00:27:52.196 --> 00:27:53.386 A:middle
This is most commonly done with

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:55.216 A:middle
locations and we can set this up

00:27:55.216 --> 00:27:57.396 A:middle
by adding another index to our

00:27:57.396 --> 00:27:58.876 A:middle
post entity, which works in the

00:27:58.876 --> 00:28:00.396 A:middle
latitude and longitude property
