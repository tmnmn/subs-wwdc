00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.496 A:middle
amount of the post content.

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:03.276 A:middle
In fact, we're only using two

00:20:03.276 --> 00:20:05.536 A:middle
properties, the image and the

00:20:05.536 --> 00:20:05.906 A:middle
title.

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:08.606 A:middle
And so we can do better than

00:20:08.606 --> 00:20:10.126 A:middle
just filtering out by entity.

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:12.216 A:middle
We can actually filter out by

00:20:12.216 --> 00:20:13.606 A:middle
updated properties using the

00:20:13.606 --> 00:20:15.756 A:middle
history changes and in this way

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.416 A:middle
we can create highly-targeted

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.026 A:middle
updates to our user experience

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:20.666 A:middle
that align with changes that

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:21.916 A:middle
will be visible to them.

00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:27.526 A:middle
But Core Data can also help you

00:20:28.146 --> 00:20:29.846 A:middle
support new interactions for

00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:30.446 A:middle
your users.

00:20:31.336 --> 00:20:32.446 A:middle
As your data becomes more

00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:35.216 A:middle
complex and grows in scale, some

00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:36.756 A:middle
editing operations can get more

00:20:36.756 --> 00:20:37.346 A:middle
expensive.

00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:39.546 A:middle
For example, consider a simple

00:20:39.546 --> 00:20:40.466 A:middle
photos browser.

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.796 A:middle
Typically, when our applications

00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:44.386 A:middle
grow, we want to -- we want to

00:20:44.386 --> 00:20:45.976 A:middle
introduce new functionality that

00:20:45.976 --> 00:20:47.276 A:middle
makes it easier to perform

00:20:47.276 --> 00:20:49.036 A:middle
repetitive tasks, such as

00:20:49.116 --> 00:20:50.136 A:middle
multiple selection.

00:20:50.506 --> 00:20:53.236 A:middle
And Core Data can support this

00:20:53.266 --> 00:20:54.826 A:middle
by using batch operations.

00:20:55.976 --> 00:20:57.946 A:middle
In fact, in just a couple lines

00:20:57.946 --> 00:20:59.436 A:middle
of code we can mark an entire

00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:01.946 A:middle
set of photos as a favorite or
