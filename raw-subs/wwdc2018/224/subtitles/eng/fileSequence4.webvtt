00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.506 A:middle
How do we fix this?

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:03.926 A:middle
Well, we could resuscitate the

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.206 A:middle
model out of the framework

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:06.766 A:middle
bundle ourselves and use one of

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:07.456 A:middle
the container's other

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:08.666 A:middle
initializers, like one that

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:10.606 A:middle
takes an explicit managed object

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:12.986 A:middle
model, but NSPersistentContainer

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.486 A:middle
actually has a way for you to

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.036 A:middle
change which bundle it searches.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.856 A:middle
See, NSPersistentContainer knows

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.086 A:middle
when it's been subclassed and

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:21.906 A:middle
will use the type of the

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:24.106 A:middle
subclass as a hint when it looks

00:04:24.106 --> 00:04:24.666 A:middle
for the model.

00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:26.256 A:middle
All we need to do to take

00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:27.566 A:middle
advantage of this is to create a

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:28.236 A:middle
subclass.

00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:29.826 A:middle
It doesn't even need to have

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:30.466 A:middle
anything in it.

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:33.026 A:middle
Then, any code setting up

00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:33.976 A:middle
through the container that wants

00:04:33.976 --> 00:04:35.816 A:middle
to use our model can just adopt

00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:37.466 A:middle
that subclass and the persistent

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:38.646 A:middle
container will check in our

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:40.106 A:middle
frameworks bundle for our model

00:04:40.106 --> 00:04:40.586 A:middle
instead.

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:45.126 A:middle
So, that's fun, but since we're

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:45.856 A:middle
going through the effort of

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:47.286 A:middle
factoring our app's resources,

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:48.486 A:middle
wouldn't it be nice if we also

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
improved the organization of our

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:50.426 A:middle
data on disk?

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:53.306 A:middle
By default, new persistent

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:54.276 A:middle
containers come with a store

00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:55.986 A:middle
description for an SQLite store

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:58.136 A:middle
with automatic migration that on

00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.926 A:middle
iOS lives in our app's documents

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:00.366 A:middle
directory.
