00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:00.896 A:middle
pretty specialized view

00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:01.606 A:middle
controllers here.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.386 A:middle
Here's one that shows all of my

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:04.826 A:middle
posts as well as another that

00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:06.746 A:middle
shows all posts by all authors.

00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:08.226 A:middle
Even the detail views are

00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:09.166 A:middle
duplicated.

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:10.796 A:middle
It feels a lot like we could

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:13.386 A:middle
have written half the code.

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:15.656 A:middle
All we should really need is one

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:16.916 A:middle
view controller for displaying a

00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:18.556 A:middle
list of posts and another for

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:19.926 A:middle
displaying a single post.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.656 A:middle
We can accomplish this by

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.526 A:middle
defining good boundaries in

00:06:23.526 --> 00:06:25.516 A:middle
between our view controllers in

00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:26.916 A:middle
the form of interfaces that take

00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:27.786 A:middle
model objects.

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:30.576 A:middle
Each controller gets configured

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:33.026 A:middle
by its model parameters and then

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:34.136 A:middle
they can customize their views

00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:35.306 A:middle
in cells based on whether

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:36.626 A:middle
they're showing my posts or

00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:37.386 A:middle
someone else's.

00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:40.936 A:middle
When drafting view controllers

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:42.566 A:middle
using Core Data, list views

00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:44.016 A:middle
should get fetch requests and

00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:45.406 A:middle
detail views should get managed

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:46.096 A:middle
objects.

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:48.776 A:middle
View controllers also need a

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:50.446 A:middle
managed object context, either

00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.076 A:middle
the container's view context or

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:53.886 A:middle
some other main queue context.

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.536 A:middle
And this pattern for

00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:56.806 A:middle
generalizing view controllers

00:06:56.806 --> 00:06:58.176 A:middle
with Core Data isn't just for

00:06:58.176 --> 00:06:59.596 A:middle
UIs; it works really well for

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.836 A:middle
utility types as well.
