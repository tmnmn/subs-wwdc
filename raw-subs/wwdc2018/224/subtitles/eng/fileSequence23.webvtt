00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.926 A:middle
across the entire platform and

00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:03.146 A:middle
the KeyedArchiver API has

00:23:03.146 --> 00:23:04.596 A:middle
changed significantly this year

00:23:04.596 --> 00:23:05.436 A:middle
in support of that.

00:23:06.496 --> 00:23:07.786 A:middle
For Core Data, this means that

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.586 A:middle
value transformers are changing,

00:23:09.586 --> 00:23:11.066 A:middle
so if you have a transformable

00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:13.086 A:middle
property in your managed object

00:23:13.086 --> 00:23:14.916 A:middle
model and you're not sending a

00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:16.876 A:middle
value transformer today, you

00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:17.836 A:middle
used to be getting

00:23:18.036 --> 00:23:18.946 A:middle
NSKeyedUnarchive

00:23:18.946 --> 00:23:20.696 A:middle
FromDataTransformer as your

00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:22.316 A:middle
default value transformer.

00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:24.446 A:middle
In the future, you'll be getting

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:25.616 A:middle
NSSecureUnarchive

00:23:25.736 --> 00:23:28.196 A:middle
FromDataTransformer and this

00:23:28.196 --> 00:23:29.496 A:middle
implements secure coding under

00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:31.016 A:middle
the covers and you should adopt

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:31.576 A:middle
it today.

00:23:32.176 --> 00:23:33.416 A:middle
There was a great talk this

00:23:33.416 --> 00:23:35.496 A:middle
morning about exactly this topic

00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:38.216 A:middle
called the Data You Can Trust

00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:40.006 A:middle
and I highly recommend that you

00:23:40.006 --> 00:23:41.666 A:middle
view it to get more information

00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:43.496 A:middle
about secure coding and how to

00:23:43.496 --> 00:23:44.706 A:middle
make your applications more

00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:45.146 A:middle
resilient.

00:23:48.246 --> 00:23:49.356 A:middle
You can specify this in the

00:23:49.356 --> 00:23:50.266 A:middle
model editor with a

00:23:50.266 --> 00:23:52.976 A:middle
transformable property by the

00:23:52.976 --> 00:23:54.766 A:middle
value transformer name field.

00:23:55.716 --> 00:23:57.486 A:middle
And today, we want you to

00:23:57.486 --> 00:23:59.676 A:middle
implement this on your own.
