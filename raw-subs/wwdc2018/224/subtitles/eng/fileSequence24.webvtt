00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:01.566 A:middle
This will become the default in

00:24:01.566 --> 00:24:03.506 A:middle
a future release and in a future

00:24:03.506 --> 00:24:04.986 A:middle
release Xcode will also start

00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:06.266 A:middle
emitting a warning for anyone

00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:07.886 A:middle
that's using the default value

00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:08.706 A:middle
transformer name.

00:24:10.036 --> 00:24:10.956 A:middle
If you're building your models

00:24:10.956 --> 00:24:13.056 A:middle
in code, you can set it by using

00:24:13.056 --> 00:24:14.146 A:middle
the valueTransformerName

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:15.996 A:middle
property on NSAttribute

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:16.416 A:middle
description.

00:24:17.726 --> 00:24:19.046 A:middle
This should be transparent for

00:24:19.046 --> 00:24:21.176 A:middle
you if you're not encoding

00:24:21.176 --> 00:24:22.256 A:middle
custom class types.

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:23.926 A:middle
So, for plist types, this is a

00:24:23.926 --> 00:24:24.306 A:middle
no op.

00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:25.806 A:middle
You simply change the value

00:24:25.806 --> 00:24:27.336 A:middle
transformer name and you'll get

00:24:27.336 --> 00:24:28.726 A:middle
the new secure coding behavior.

00:24:29.286 --> 00:24:30.856 A:middle
However, if you are implementing

00:24:30.856 --> 00:24:32.456 A:middle
custom classes, those classes

00:24:32.456 --> 00:24:34.786 A:middle
need to adopt secure coding and

00:24:34.846 --> 00:24:36.276 A:middle
you can come see us in the labs

00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:37.616 A:middle
for help with that.

00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:40.486 A:middle
But we can help you more.

00:24:41.286 --> 00:24:42.866 A:middle
At Core Data, we've spent time

00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:44.726 A:middle
building in new debugging tools

00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:46.566 A:middle
over the years that can help you

00:24:46.566 --> 00:24:47.796 A:middle
understand what's going on under

00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:48.236 A:middle
the stack.

00:24:49.026 --> 00:24:50.216 A:middle
So, this is a picture of our

00:24:50.216 --> 00:24:51.666 A:middle
preferred default scheme

00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:52.536 A:middle
configuration.

00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:54.686 A:middle
We have a couple of process

00:24:54.686 --> 00:24:56.396 A:middle
arguments that we have that can

00:24:56.396 --> 00:24:57.386 A:middle
help you get more debugging

00:24:57.386 --> 00:24:59.416 A:middle
information about SQLite, but

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
the big one you should always
