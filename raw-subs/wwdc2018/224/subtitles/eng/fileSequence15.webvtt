00:14:58.486 --> 00:15:01.106 A:middle
But those are really hard for us

00:15:01.106 --> 00:15:02.476 A:middle
to capture as engineers.

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:04.326 A:middle
So, we translate them into

00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:06.186 A:middle
engineering metrics, things like

00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:08.276 A:middle
peak memory consumption, how

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:09.836 A:middle
much battery drains during a

00:15:09.836 --> 00:15:12.056 A:middle
given task or how much CPU time

00:15:12.436 --> 00:15:13.896 A:middle
is burned during a given task.

00:15:14.316 --> 00:15:16.206 A:middle
And, finally, how much IO we do

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:17.906 A:middle
during a given task.

00:15:18.806 --> 00:15:19.656 A:middle
To make this a little more

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:20.886 A:middle
concrete, we'll use this

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:21.626 A:middle
application.

00:15:22.286 --> 00:15:23.236 A:middle
Some of you may remember the

00:15:23.236 --> 00:15:24.736 A:middle
history demo application that

00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:26.886 A:middle
was introduced last year at WWDC

00:15:27.306 --> 00:15:28.536 A:middle
and I've modified it for the

00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:29.676 A:middle
purposes of this talk.

00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:32.156 A:middle
There are a few actions here

00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:33.466 A:middle
that a customer can take while

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.526 A:middle
using our application.

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:36.676 A:middle
The first is they can add a

00:15:36.676 --> 00:15:38.826 A:middle
single post to our database by

00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:39.746 A:middle
hitting the + button.

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:42.256 A:middle
They can also download any

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:44.546 A:middle
pending data from the server by

00:15:44.546 --> 00:15:45.406 A:middle
tapping Download.

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.796 A:middle
And, finally, for anything that

00:15:52.796 --> 00:15:53.966 A:middle
hasn't yet been uploaded to a

00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:55.636 A:middle
server, they can tap Post All.

00:15:56.596 --> 00:15:58.466 A:middle
Now, this application has a

00:15:58.466 --> 00:16:00.416 A:middle
fairly small set of interactions
