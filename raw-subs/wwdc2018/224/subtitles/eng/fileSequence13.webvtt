00:12:59.356 --> 00:13:04.546 A:middle
We could just register for the

00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:07.156 A:middle
managed object contextWillSave

00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:08.866 A:middle
notification with a function

00:13:09.296 --> 00:13:10.286 A:middle
that goes through all of the

00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:11.406 A:middle
posts that have been inserted,

00:13:11.696 --> 00:13:13.136 A:middle
incrementing the count for each

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:15.626 A:middle
day that's relevant, and another

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:16.946 A:middle
loop going through all of the

00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:18.186 A:middle
deleted objects, decrementing

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:18.956 A:middle
the count for each day.

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:20.656 A:middle
And that affects the state of

00:13:20.656 --> 00:13:22.106 A:middle
the context before it commits to

00:13:22.106 --> 00:13:23.516 A:middle
the database, so it all winds up

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:25.166 A:middle
happening in one transaction, so

00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:27.236 A:middle
this scales really well, which

00:13:27.236 --> 00:13:28.916 A:middle
is useful because my teammate

00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:30.366 A:middle
Nick Gillett is here to talk

00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:31.676 A:middle
about how Core Data can help us

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.296 A:middle
as our little app scales beyond

00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:34.186 A:middle
our wildest dreams.

00:13:34.846 --> 00:13:34.976 A:middle
Nick.

00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:37.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Scott.

00:13:40.816 --> 00:13:42.296 A:middle
So, as Scott said, as your

00:13:42.296 --> 00:13:43.876 A:middle
applications grow, they get more

00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:46.606 A:middle
and more complex and at Core

00:13:46.606 --> 00:13:48.196 A:middle
Data it's really important to us

00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:50.656 A:middle
that your applications do grow.

00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:51.746 A:middle
In fact, we want this.

00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:53.336 A:middle
That's the whole reason we exist

00:13:53.426 --> 00:13:54.626 A:middle
is to help you manage this

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.166 A:middle
growth, make it efficient for

00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:58.026 A:middle
you to work with, and help you

00:13:58.026 --> 00:13:59.106 A:middle
give more value to your

00:13:59.106 --> 00:13:59.656 A:middle
customers.
