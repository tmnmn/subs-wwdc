00:21:59.176 --> 00:22:00.976 A:middle
problems with batch operations

00:22:01.596 --> 00:22:02.776 A:middle
is that they were difficult to

00:22:02.776 --> 00:22:03.926 A:middle
work with because they don't

00:22:03.926 --> 00:22:05.606 A:middle
generate save notifications.

00:22:06.376 --> 00:22:07.426 A:middle
That's where history tracking

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:08.176 A:middle
comes back in.

00:22:09.026 --> 00:22:10.016 A:middle
With persistent history

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:11.306 A:middle
tracking, we can fetch out the

00:22:11.306 --> 00:22:12.846 A:middle
transactions from the database

00:22:13.286 --> 00:22:14.266 A:middle
that occurred as part of the

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:17.156 A:middle
batch delete or update and we

00:22:17.156 --> 00:22:18.996 A:middle
can use the objectIDNotification

00:22:18.996 --> 00:22:20.276 A:middle
method to generate a

00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:21.676 A:middle
notification that works like a

00:22:21.676 --> 00:22:22.866 A:middle
save notification.

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:24.786 A:middle
In this way, the fetched results

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:26.666 A:middle
controller or any other context

00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:28.846 A:middle
in your application can update

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:29.846 A:middle
to those notifications

00:22:29.846 --> 00:22:30.656 A:middle
incrementally.

00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:35.546 A:middle
And so those are some ways you

00:22:35.546 --> 00:22:37.016 A:middle
can manage growing data with

00:22:37.016 --> 00:22:39.456 A:middle
Core Data, but how about your

00:22:39.456 --> 00:22:40.586 A:middle
workflow itself?

00:22:40.966 --> 00:22:43.396 A:middle
What can Core Data do for you as

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:45.426 A:middle
a developer and engineer to make

00:22:45.426 --> 00:22:46.886 A:middle
it easier to build and test your

00:22:46.886 --> 00:22:47.726 A:middle
applications?

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:51.136 A:middle
The first thing is that we can

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.286 A:middle
help future you today.

00:22:53.856 --> 00:22:55.576 A:middle
As you may know, NSKeyedArchiver

00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:56.326 A:middle
is changing.

00:22:57.056 --> 00:22:58.416 A:middle
We're adopting secure coding

00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.926 A:middle
across the entire platform and
