00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
the big one you should always

00:25:00.746 --> 00:25:02.566 A:middle
run with is com.apple.Core

00:25:02.566 --> 00:25:04.066 A:middle
Data.ConcurrencyDebug.

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:06.266 A:middle
And this will catch any queue

00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:07.746 A:middle
exceptions in your applications,

00:25:07.746 --> 00:25:09.396 A:middle
so areas that you may be

00:25:09.396 --> 00:25:10.766 A:middle
transferring objects between

00:25:10.766 --> 00:25:11.926 A:middle
main and background queue

00:25:11.926 --> 00:25:14.066 A:middle
contexts or areas that you may

00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:15.566 A:middle
not be obeying a managed

00:25:15.566 --> 00:25:18.666 A:middle
object's actual context.

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.466 A:middle
SQLite also has a number of

00:25:20.466 --> 00:25:21.506 A:middle
interesting environment

00:25:21.506 --> 00:25:23.206 A:middle
variables, so their threading

00:25:23.206 --> 00:25:24.756 A:middle
and file assertions are a great

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:25.836 A:middle
way to ensure you have

00:25:25.836 --> 00:25:27.286 A:middle
correctness in your application

00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:29.016 A:middle
around their API as well as the

00:25:29.016 --> 00:25:29.746 A:middle
file system.

00:25:30.576 --> 00:25:32.386 A:middle
And auto tracing is a great way

00:25:32.386 --> 00:25:33.496 A:middle
for you to see what's going on

00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:34.826 A:middle
under the covers, an additional

00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:36.046 A:middle
tour on debug logging.

00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:39.646 A:middle
com.apple.Core Data.SQLDebug has

00:25:39.646 --> 00:25:40.676 A:middle
four levels.

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:43.206 A:middle
The first level is the most

00:25:43.206 --> 00:25:44.636 A:middle
interesting and the least of a

00:25:44.636 --> 00:25:45.466 A:middle
performance hit.

00:25:45.466 --> 00:25:47.826 A:middle
The fourth level is the most

00:25:47.826 --> 00:25:49.126 A:middle
verbose, but does cause

00:25:49.126 --> 00:25:51.006 A:middle
significant performance hit when

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:53.726 A:middle
you run with it.

00:25:53.996 --> 00:25:55.696 A:middle
When you enable SQL debugging

00:25:55.806 --> 00:25:57.146 A:middle
and our multi-threading

00:25:57.146 --> 00:25:58.476 A:middle
assertions, you'll see a couple

00:25:58.506 --> 00:26:00.456 A:middle
of logs in the console and these
