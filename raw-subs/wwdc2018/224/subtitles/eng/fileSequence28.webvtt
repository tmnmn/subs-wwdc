latitude and longitude property

00:28:00.396 --> 00:28:02.046 A:middle
that I added for the purposes of

00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:02.536 A:middle
this slide.

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:06.836 A:middle
We change the query type in this

00:28:06.836 --> 00:28:08.246 A:middle
box by selecting R-tree.

00:28:08.796 --> 00:28:10.836 A:middle
And then we can set up our

00:28:10.836 --> 00:28:12.556 A:middle
predicate on the fetch request

00:28:13.206 --> 00:28:14.906 A:middle
to say get all of the posts that

00:28:14.906 --> 00:28:16.136 A:middle
happen inside of continental

00:28:16.136 --> 00:28:16.516 A:middle
China.

00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:20.186 A:middle
This predicate is a little more

00:28:20.186 --> 00:28:21.656 A:middle
advanced because it uses

00:28:21.716 --> 00:28:24.306 A:middle
functions inside the actual

00:28:24.306 --> 00:28:26.256 A:middle
select statement to hit the

00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:27.676 A:middle
index that we created in the

00:28:27.676 --> 00:28:28.676 A:middle
managed object model.

00:28:31.556 --> 00:28:33.266 A:middle
When we run our application

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:35.016 A:middle
without this predicate and

00:28:35.016 --> 00:28:36.596 A:middle
without this index, we see the

00:28:36.596 --> 00:28:38.266 A:middle
same results that we saw before

00:28:38.726 --> 00:28:40.696 A:middle
where we're hitting only the

00:28:40.696 --> 00:28:41.826 A:middle
timestamp index.

00:28:42.366 --> 00:28:44.956 A:middle
But when we run it with our new

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:47.196 A:middle
index and predicate, we see that

00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:48.956 A:middle
SQLite is using the index to

00:28:48.956 --> 00:28:51.626 A:middle
generate faster results for both

00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.056 A:middle
of the between statements.

00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:56.806 A:middle
Unfortunately, because our

00:28:56.806 --> 00:28:58.446 A:middle
timestamp index doesn't have any

00:28:58.446 --> 00:28:59.656 A:middle
bounding predicates on it,

00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:01.566 A:middle
SQLite can't use it for the
