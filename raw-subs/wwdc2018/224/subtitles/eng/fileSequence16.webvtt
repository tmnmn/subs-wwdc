00:15:58.466 --> 00:16:00.416 A:middle
fairly small set of interactions

00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:02.366 A:middle
that a customer can take, and

00:16:02.366 --> 00:16:04.156 A:middle
yet, as these happen

00:16:04.156 --> 00:16:06.936 A:middle
concurrently, it tends towards

00:16:06.936 --> 00:16:07.516 A:middle
chaos.

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:11.536 A:middle
So, we can see that even with

00:16:11.536 --> 00:16:12.936 A:middle
this small set of actions,

00:16:13.596 --> 00:16:14.806 A:middle
things that go on concurrently

00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:15.676 A:middle
could cause a number of

00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:16.756 A:middle
different state changes in the

00:16:16.756 --> 00:16:18.776 A:middle
application and the worst thing

00:16:18.776 --> 00:16:20.436 A:middle
for us is to end up with a user

00:16:20.436 --> 00:16:21.826 A:middle
experience that looks like this.

00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:23.666 A:middle
This notion of partial

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.336 A:middle
completeness doesn't make sense

00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:26.196 A:middle
to our customers.

00:16:26.196 --> 00:16:27.466 A:middle
In fact, it doesn't make sense

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:28.156 A:middle
to us either.

00:16:29.816 --> 00:16:30.836 A:middle
Core Data is here to help with

00:16:30.886 --> 00:16:32.676 A:middle
that with query generations.

00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:33.946 A:middle
Query generations were

00:16:33.946 --> 00:16:36.556 A:middle
introduced in 2016 in our What's

00:16:36.556 --> 00:16:37.656 A:middle
New in Core Data session.

00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:39.076 A:middle
So, if you're not yet familiar

00:16:39.076 --> 00:16:40.286 A:middle
with them, I highly recommend

00:16:40.286 --> 00:16:41.516 A:middle
that you check out that session

00:16:41.516 --> 00:16:42.806 A:middle
for more information about how

00:16:42.806 --> 00:16:43.356 A:middle
they work.

00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:45.626 A:middle
What you do need to know is that

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:47.506 A:middle
they require wall journal mode

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:48.786 A:middle
and only work with SQLite.

00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:51.746 A:middle
The goal of query generations is

00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:53.186 A:middle
to isolate your managed object

00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:54.896 A:middle
contexts from competing work.

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:56.406 A:middle
This could be rights to the

00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:58.566 A:middle
background or actions that the

00:16:58.566 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
user is taking that you're not
