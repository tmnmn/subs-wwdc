00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:02.046 A:middle
In this case, we don't want that

00:18:02.046 --> 00:18:03.406 A:middle
data to manifest in the user

00:18:03.406 --> 00:18:05.716 A:middle
interface or cause changes to it

00:18:05.716 --> 00:18:06.776 A:middle
because none of the change will

00:18:06.776 --> 00:18:07.996 A:middle
be visible to the user.

00:18:08.526 --> 00:18:09.876 A:middle
So, we can actually filter out

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:11.516 A:middle
these updates by using history

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:11.976 A:middle
tracking.

00:18:12.786 --> 00:18:14.276 A:middle
Persistent history tracking was

00:18:14.276 --> 00:18:17.456 A:middle
new in iOS 11 and macOS 10.13.

00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:19.996 A:middle
We introduced it in our session,

00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:22.036 A:middle
What's New in Core Data, last

00:18:22.116 --> 00:18:23.526 A:middle
year at WWDC, and for more

00:18:23.526 --> 00:18:24.866 A:middle
information about how it works

00:18:24.866 --> 00:18:26.626 A:middle
and what the underlying features

00:18:26.626 --> 00:18:27.866 A:middle
are of it, you can use that

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:29.566 A:middle
session as a reference.

00:18:31.966 --> 00:18:33.406 A:middle
Persistent history tracking is a

00:18:33.406 --> 00:18:35.526 A:middle
great way to get a persistent

00:18:35.526 --> 00:18:37.086 A:middle
record of each transaction that

00:18:37.086 --> 00:18:38.926 A:middle
connects to the database and

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:40.026 A:middle
this is useful to us for a

00:18:40.026 --> 00:18:41.186 A:middle
couple of different reasons.

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:43.506 A:middle
For the purposes of this talk,

00:18:43.506 --> 00:18:45.626 A:middle
though, we'll be considering

00:18:45.796 --> 00:18:47.926 A:middle
NSPersistentHistoryChange, which

00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:51.276 A:middle
gives us a changedObjectID and a

00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:52.546 A:middle
set of updatedProperties.

00:18:53.036 --> 00:18:53.176 A:middle
And

00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:55.036 A:middle
NSPersistentHistoryTransaction

00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:57.246 A:middle
which gives us a set of changes

00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:59.136 A:middle
and an objectIDNotification.
