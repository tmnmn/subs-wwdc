&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone.

[ Applause ]

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:29.096 A:middle
Welcome to Core Data Best

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:29.806 A:middle
Practices.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:30.886 A:middle
My name is Scott Perry.

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:32.016 A:middle
I work on Core Data.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.776 A:middle
And we'll be joined later by my

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:35.016 A:middle
teammate, Nick Gillett.

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:39.286 A:middle
The plan for today, first, we'll

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:40.886 A:middle
talk a bit about how the process

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:41.866 A:middle
of getting started with Core

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.216 A:middle
Data has evolved over time.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:45.946 A:middle
Then, we will cover ways we can

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.346 A:middle
evolve our application more

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:48.706 A:middle
easily by taking advantage of

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:49.886 A:middle
extension points in the

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:50.836 A:middle
persistent container.

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:53.556 A:middle
We'll follow that with how we

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:55.026 A:middle
can evolve our model as our apps

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:56.676 A:middle
requirements change and our data

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:57.236 A:middle
grows.

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:00.666 A:middle
Then, Nick is going to talk
