00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:03.046 A:middle
But this happens in ways that

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:04.216 A:middle
are very specific to your

00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:04.936 A:middle
application.

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:06.976 A:middle
It's also highly aligned with

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.696 A:middle
your customer experience or the

00:14:08.696 --> 00:14:09.936 A:middle
way that you want them to

00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:11.266 A:middle
experience your application.

00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:13.816 A:middle
Unfortunately, like all complex

00:14:13.816 --> 00:14:15.696 A:middle
systems, as it grows and becomes

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:17.646 A:middle
more complex, it also tends

00:14:17.646 --> 00:14:18.516 A:middle
toward chaos.

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:20.716 A:middle
So, today we're going to talk

00:14:20.716 --> 00:14:22.136 A:middle
about ways that Core Data can

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:23.876 A:middle
help you manage this chaos and

00:14:23.876 --> 00:14:24.896 A:middle
give it some structure.

00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:26.536 A:middle
We'll talk about building

00:14:26.536 --> 00:14:28.996 A:middle
predictable behaviors and

00:14:28.996 --> 00:14:30.436 A:middle
helping you build tunable

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:31.826 A:middle
containers that you can align

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:32.976 A:middle
with your experience metrics.

00:14:36.236 --> 00:14:37.346 A:middle
What does that mean?

00:14:38.246 --> 00:14:39.996 A:middle
Well, when we think of metrics,

00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:40.996 A:middle
there's a couple of different

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:42.646 A:middle
ways that we can think about

00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:42.946 A:middle
them.

00:14:43.396 --> 00:14:44.906 A:middle
The first is in alignment with

00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:45.696 A:middle
our customers.

00:14:46.326 --> 00:14:48.586 A:middle
And usually we define these as

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:49.836 A:middle
things that they experience,

00:14:49.836 --> 00:14:51.176 A:middle
like having a consistent user

00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:53.536 A:middle
interface or a responsive scroll

00:14:53.536 --> 00:14:57.786 A:middle
view, and also as delight.

00:14:58.486 --> 00:15:01.106 A:middle
But those are really hard for us
