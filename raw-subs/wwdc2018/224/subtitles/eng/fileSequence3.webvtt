00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.736 A:middle
to set up your stack, just refer

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:02.056 A:middle
to the model by name, and the

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.486 A:middle
persistent container will load

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:05.046 A:middle
it out of the main bundle and

00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:06.276 A:middle
keep a stored in a consistent

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:06.766 A:middle
location.

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:10.386 A:middle
This persistent container type

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:11.926 A:middle
encapsulates a whole stack and

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:13.526 A:middle
includes conveniences for a

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.256 A:middle
shared main queue view context

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:17.926 A:middle
as well as factory methods for

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:20.286 A:middle
generating background contexts

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:21.396 A:middle
as well as performing background

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:21.676 A:middle
work.

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:23.796 A:middle
It's also designed to be easy to

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:25.366 A:middle
work with as our app grows.

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.706 A:middle
For example, let's say we want

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.176 A:middle
to factor our model layer into

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:29.956 A:middle
its own framework.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:31.856 A:middle
We can do that by creating a new

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.166 A:middle
framework target in Xcode and

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:34.116 A:middle
moving our code into it.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.166 A:middle
It's all super easy, but when we

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.116 A:middle
move our model into the new

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.836 A:middle
target, in the built product,

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:40.836 A:middle
targets move from the app into

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:42.736 A:middle
the new framework, which is

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.806 A:middle
what's supposed to happen, but

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.246 A:middle
now NSPersistentContainer

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.196 A:middle
doesn't know where to find our

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:46.896 A:middle
model anymore.

00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:48.566 A:middle
This is because it only checks

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:49.846 A:middle
the main bundle by default.

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:51.056 A:middle
Why stop there?

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:53.296 A:middle
Well, searching all of the app's

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:54.826 A:middle
bundles could get really slow

00:03:54.826 --> 00:03:56.526 A:middle
for a complicated app and it's

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
not a cost you want to pay every

00:03:57.816 --> 00:03:58.866 A:middle
time you spin up a stack.
