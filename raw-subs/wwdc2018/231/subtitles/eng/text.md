[object, which is the HMHome.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1278) [Now, this is corresponds to the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1280) [overall home, and within the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1283) [HMHome,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1288) [you can also optionally have](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1288) [HMZones.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1290) [Now, these are things like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1291) [upstairs and downstairs.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1292) [Now, you could also have](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1295) [HMRooms, and these are the rooms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1296) [that are normally associated](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1298) [with the home -- the kitchen,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1299) [the living room, the dining](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1301) [room, the bedroom.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1302) [And within those rooms, you can](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1305) [have HMAccessories.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1307) [And these are the lights, the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1309) [fans, the cameras, the locks,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1310) [all the normal accessories we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1312) [support.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1314) [So your home, the HMHome](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1316) [contains HMZones.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1317) [The HMZone contains HMRooms.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1319) [The HMZone contains HMRooms.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1319) [And the HMRoom contains](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1322) [HMAccessories.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1324) [Now, the home has a handful of](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1329) [properties on it, but the home](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1330) [is really used as the central](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1332) [organizing object for HomeKit.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1334) [So the home is how you add](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1336) [accessories, configure rooms,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1338) [create scenes, and build](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1341) [automations.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1343) [But some users may have more](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1346) [than one home, and so you'll](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1347) [need to use the HMHomeManager to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1349) [help manage these homes.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1352) [So if you want to add a new home](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1354) [or remove an existing home,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1356) [that's done through the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1358) [HMHomeManager APIs.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1359) [Now, the great thing about](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1365) [HomeKit is you can extend home](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1366) [control to other users.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1368) [We also have access control](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1371) [capabilities so you can give a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1373) [spouse or a roommate full](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1375) [administrative privileges.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1377) [Now, as an administrator, they,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1378) [Now, as an administrator, they,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1378) [these users can add accessories,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1381) [edit scenes.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1383) [They basically have full control](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1384) [over the home.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1386) [But you may only want to give](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1389) [some users normal access to the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1391) [home and only allow them to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1392) [control accessories and not edit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1395) [them.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1396) [And those are](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1397) [non-administrators.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1398) [Now, the important take-away](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1401) [here is that if you're building](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1402) [an app, you want to make sure](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1403) [that if your HM user is not an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1405) [administrator that you disable](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1407) [some key functionality so that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1409) [it doesn't fail when they go try](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1411) [and use it.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1413) [Again, all this user management](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1416) [is done through the HMHome](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1418) [object, and you'll quickly see](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1419) [that this is a common design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1422) [pattern we use where the HMHome](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1423) [exposes a lot of the basic](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1426) [functionality.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1427) [So let's take a look at some](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1428) [sample code and see what this](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1431) [looks like.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1432) [So here we have a class where we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1433) [will instantiate an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1438) [will instantiate an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1438) [HMHomeManager.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1440) [Now, we want to add a home to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1441) [that home manager, so we'll use](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1444) [the addHome APIs and specify the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1446) [name of the home.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1448) [Now, we want to be sure to set](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1450) [ourselves as the delegate, so](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1452) [we'll get the appropriate](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1453) [delegate callbacks.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1454) [And finally, if we want to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1456) [configure the users for the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1458) [home, we'll call manageUsers on](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1459) [HMHome.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1462) [Now, I mentioned HMZones](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1467) [earlier, so let's take a little](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1469) [peek at that.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1470) [So this is a way of grouping](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1471) [multiple rooms together, like](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1472) [upstairs and downstairs, or you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1475) [can group all the bedrooms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1479) [together in a single zone.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1480) [So it has some basic properties](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1482) [on it like name and access to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1484) [the rooms, but it also has this](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1487) [unique identifier property.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1488) [And this could often be](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1490) [overlooked, but this is a way](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1492) [that you keep track of which](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1493) [zone you're, you care about.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1494) [So when the name changes or the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1496) [rooms change, you still have an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1498) [access to that specific zone.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1499) [access to that specific zone.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1499) [Now, on the HMRoom object, we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1504) [also support exposing the name](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1506) [and the list of the accessories,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1508) [and it also contains this unique](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1510) [identifier property so you can](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1512) [keep track of rooms as well.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1513) [Again, the rooms and zones are](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1517) [managed through the HMHome APIs,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1519) [so if you want to add or remove](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1522) [a room or if you want to add or](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1524) [remove a zone, you do through,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1526) [do that through the HMHome APIs.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1528) [So if we go back to some sample](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1531) [code, let's take a look at this](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1534) [[inaudible] in action.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1537) [So here we are adding a room to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1540) [the home with our roomName.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1542) [And then, we're adding a zone to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1544) [the home with a zoneName.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1547) [And then, we associate that room](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1549) [to the zone.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1552) [Now, the next level of object](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1558) [hierarchy that's important is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1559) [hierarchy that's important is](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1559) [the relationship between](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1561) [accessories, services, and](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1562) [characteristics.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1564) [Now, this can sound confusing,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1566) [as accessories contain services](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1568) [and services contain](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1570) [characteristics.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1571) [So it's best to look at a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1573) [real-world example to give you](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1574) [an idea how, really how this](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1575) [fits together.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1576) [So let's say you have a ceiling](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1577) [fan fixture.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1580) [Now, this is a single accessory,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1582) [and it has a light, and it has a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1586) [fan.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1591) [So this maps to a light service](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1592) [and a fan service.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1598) [Now, these services have a set](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1601) [of common characteristics that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1603) [are shared across all services,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1605) [but they also have](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1607) [characteristics that are unique](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1609) [to their

[types of action sets are](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1958) [possible, but this is also what](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1959) [we've found to be some of the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1961) [most useful.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1962) [Now, of course, we also

[the action sets, and the HMHome](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1984) [APIs also expose the way

[sample code, we'll see that if](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=1999) [we want to create an action

they can be presence based,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2058) [so you could turn off

a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2105) [lot of control with the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2106)

[creation of an HMTrigger and how](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2114) [we add it to the home.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2116) [So let's say we want to create](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2118) [an automation that will run](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2119) [every night at 7 p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2120) [So first, we create our date](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2123) [components and we set the time](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2125) [to be 7 p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2126) [Then, we'll create a calendar](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2129) [event using that component.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2130) [Then, we'll generate a trigger](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2134) [using that time event.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2136) [Now, we need to add that trigger](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2137) [to the home.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2140) [And we need to add the action](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2141) [set to the trigger.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2144) [So this allows you to run an](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2145) [automation every night at 7 p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2148) [So let's say it's turning on a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2150) [light every night at 7 p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2152) [Now, that's great, except for](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2155) [sometimes, some parts of the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2156) [year, it's not dark at 7

p.m.,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2159) [or sometimes, parts of the year,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2161) [it gets dark before 7 p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2162) [Sometimes it gets dark after 7](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2164) [p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2166) [So turning on the light at 7](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2167) [p.m. every night isn't really](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2168) [what you want.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2169) [So we also support what we call](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2172) [significant time events.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2174) [And this is sunrise and sunset.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2176) [So if we look at that previous](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2179) [example, we could change that to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2181) [say, turn on the light every](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2183) [night at 7 p.m.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2186) [We also support relative time](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2188) [offsets, so you can have the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2190) [light turn on, say, 30 minutes](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2192) [prior to sunset.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2194) [So let's go back to the code we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2195) [had before and make some changes](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2198) [so that we can have it run every](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2202) [night at 30 minutes before](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2204) [sunset.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2205) [So the first thing we need to do](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2206) [is change our date components to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2209) [be 30 minutes.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2211) [Now, you'll see that it's](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2213) [negative 30 here because we want](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2214) [it to run 30 minutes prior to](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2215) [sunset.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2217) [Then, we'll create a significant](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2219) [Then, we'll create a significant](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2219) [time event for sunset and pass](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2220) [in that offset.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2223) [Then, when we generate our](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2224) [trigger, we pass in the sunset](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2226) [event.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2228) [Then, we execute the code we had](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2231) [before, which is adding the](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2233) [trigger to the home and adding](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2234) [the action set to the trigger.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2236) [But sometimes you don't want](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2242) [these automations to run.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2243) [You probably don't want the heat](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2246) [to turn on in the morning if

[Now, to set these conditions, we](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2304) [use predicates.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2307) [So let's take a look at some](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2308) [sample code.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2311) [So here we can see that we're](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2314) [using our same sunset

we're going to create a](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2321) [presence event that's when

use that presence](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2330) [event to generate a

[So now, we've gone from having](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/231/?time=2353) [an automation that runs
