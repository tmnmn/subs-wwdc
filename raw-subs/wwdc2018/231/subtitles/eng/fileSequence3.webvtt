00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:00.996 A:middle
Blinds can open and close.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.406 A:middle
And scenes allow you to

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:03.966 A:middle
basically specify a desired

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:05.346 A:middle
state for all these accessories.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:07.126 A:middle
So you can have a good night

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:08.956 A:middle
scene that turns off the lights,

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.596 A:middle
closes the blinds, locks the

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.216 A:middle
door, and sets the thermostat.

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:15.576 A:middle
Then, when you're ready for bed,

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:17.676 A:middle
you simply tap on the tile for

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.596 A:middle
"Good Night," and HomeKit

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.446 A:middle
prepares your house for the

00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:20.726 A:middle
evening.

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.476 A:middle
Now, in iOS, we also have quick

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:34.046 A:middle
access to Home shortcuts via

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:34.736 A:middle
Control Center.

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:37.196 A:middle
This is a great way to view and

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.756 A:middle
control your favorite HomeKit

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:40.476 A:middle
accessories, and it even

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:41.986 A:middle
provides access to your scenes.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.386 A:middle
Now, this is very-- really

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:46.466 A:middle
convenient, but another great

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.416 A:middle
way to control HomeKit

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:48.976 A:middle
accessories is through Siri.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.066 A:middle
You can tell Siri good morning,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.046 A:middle
and that will kick off your good

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:54.686 A:middle
morning scene.

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
You can also use Siri to control

00:03:57.816 --> 00:03:59.356 A:middle
individual HomeKit accessories.
