00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
Now, we also have tools to help

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.316 A:middle
with certification, and we also

00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:05.986 A:middle
provide access to documentation

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:09.176 A:middle
to help you get off the ground.

00:14:09.176 --> 00:14:10.226 A:middle
You'll also get a copy of the

00:14:10.226 --> 00:14:11.506 A:middle
specification that has all the

00:14:11.506 --> 00:14:13.996 A:middle
commercial support, including

00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:15.356 A:middle
how to build authentication

00:14:15.436 --> 00:14:16.326 A:middle
right into your accessory.

00:14:16.966 --> 00:14:21.266 A:middle
Now, the ADK makes it easy than

00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:22.156 A:middle
ever to build a HomeKit

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:22.626 A:middle
accessory.

00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:24.966 A:middle
Previously, you would need to

00:14:24.966 --> 00:14:26.116 A:middle
worry about building your

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.516 A:middle
accessory logic, adopting the

00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:30.786 A:middle
protocol, implementing crypto,

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:32.886 A:middle
adopting WAC, all these other

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:33.366 A:middle
steps.

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.116 A:middle
With the accessory development

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:36.976 A:middle
kit, we've abstracted all this

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:37.486 A:middle
away for you.

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:39.856 A:middle
So we provide the platform logic

00:14:40.336 --> 00:14:42.396 A:middle
for your specific accessory, and

00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:43.126 A:middle
the HomeKit Accessory

00:14:43.126 --> 00:14:44.516 A:middle
Development Kit handles a lot of

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:45.216 A:middle
the details.

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.196 A:middle
This means you only need to

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.246 A:middle
worry about that accessory

00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:49.426 A:middle
logic, which is the part that's

00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:51.366 A:middle
unique to your accessory and is

00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:52.696 A:middle
the part of the code that you

00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:53.566 A:middle
care about.

00:14:55.516 --> 00:15:01.436 A:middle
