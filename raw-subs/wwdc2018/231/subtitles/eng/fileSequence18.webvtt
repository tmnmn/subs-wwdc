00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
hardware-based authentication,

00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:04.726 A:middle
but we have also recently began

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:05.966 A:middle
supporting software-based

00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:06.566 A:middle
authentication.

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:10.956 A:middle
Now, customers can be guaranteed

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.406 A:middle
the same level of quality and

00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:14.296 A:middle
trust, and the integration

00:18:14.296 --> 00:18:15.736 A:middle
support can be rolled out via a

00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:16.466 A:middle
firmware update.

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:19.836 A:middle
Now, this is great because this

00:18:19.836 --> 00:18:21.096 A:middle
means you can roll out HomeKit

00:18:21.096 --> 00:18:22.366 A:middle
to accessories that are already

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:23.326 A:middle
shipping to customers.

00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:27.846 A:middle
Now, there are three other great

00:18:27.846 --> 00:18:29.056 A:middle
tools that I want to talk about

00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:29.506 A:middle
this morning.

00:18:30.766 --> 00:18:32.626 A:middle
The first is a resource for

00:18:32.626 --> 00:18:34.506 A:middle
accessory developers, and this

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:36.146 A:middle
is available for MFI licensees,

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:37.436 A:middle
and this is the HomeKit

00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:38.356 A:middle
Accessory Tester.

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:41.846 A:middle
Now, this is an app that allows

00:18:41.846 --> 00:18:43.396 A:middle
an easy interface for helping

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:44.626 A:middle
you test your accessory.

00:18:46.056 --> 00:18:48.076 A:middle
This is a great way to validate

00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:49.086 A:middle
that your accessory is ready to

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.026 A:middle
be submitted to the review

00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
process.

00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:54.316 A:middle
Now, the second tool I want to

00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:55.986 A:middle
talk about is the HomeKit

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:57.166 A:middle
Certification Assistant.

00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
Now, this resource is also
