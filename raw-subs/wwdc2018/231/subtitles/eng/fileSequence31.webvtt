00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.126 A:middle
So if we look at some sample

00:31:00.126 --> 00:31:01.616 A:middle
code on how we would add an

00:31:01.616 --> 00:31:03.226 A:middle
accessory to the home, you just

00:31:03.726 --> 00:31:05.336 A:middle
need to call addAnd

00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:07.006 A:middle
SetupAccessories on the home

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.936 A:middle
object, and HomeKit takes care

00:31:08.936 --> 00:31:11.326 A:middle
of the rest.

00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:13.866 A:middle
Now, I mentioned scenes earlier,

00:31:14.416 --> 00:31:15.536 A:middle
but it's a pretty powerful

00:31:15.536 --> 00:31:17.126 A:middle
concept, so I want to go a bit

00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:17.466 A:middle
deeper.

00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:19.806 A:middle
Now, this is how you can

00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:21.136 A:middle
integrate different types of

00:31:21.136 --> 00:31:22.886 A:middle
accessories together to help

00:31:22.886 --> 00:31:24.336 A:middle
provide a cohesive experience.

00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:28.746 A:middle
We have some suggested scenes,

00:31:29.616 --> 00:31:30.906 A:middle
but we also allow full

00:31:30.906 --> 00:31:32.656 A:middle
customization by the user.

00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:37.886 A:middle
Now, one of the great things

00:31:37.886 --> 00:31:39.556 A:middle
about scenes is that Siri

00:31:39.556 --> 00:31:41.156 A:middle
understands what scenes are.

00:31:41.296 --> 00:31:44.026 A:middle
And so speaking the name to Siri

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:46.076 A:middle
execute, speaking the name of a

00:31:46.076 --> 00:31:47.646 A:middle
scene to Siri will execute the

00:31:47.646 --> 00:31:48.356 A:middle
scene directly.

00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:53.266 A:middle
Now, we don't call them scenes

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:53.776 A:middle
in HomeKit.

00:31:54.486 --> 00:31:56.276 A:middle
We call them HMActionSets.

00:31:57.286 --> 00:31:58.316 A:middle
So if you want to create an

00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:59.826 A:middle
HMActionSet -- for example,

00:31:59.956 --> 00:32:02.366 A:middle
arriving home -- you'll need to
