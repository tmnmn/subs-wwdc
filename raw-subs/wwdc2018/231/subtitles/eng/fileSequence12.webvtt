00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:00.786 A:middle
list of categories, and we

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.336 A:middle
support multiple manufacturers

00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:03.316 A:middle
in these categories.

00:12:04.046 --> 00:12:05.666 A:middle
So you can find the one that's

00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:06.116 A:middle
right for you.

00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:08.766 A:middle
With HomeKit, you can even

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:10.866 A:middle
combine accessories in the same

00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:12.206 A:middle
category from different

00:12:12.206 --> 00:12:13.646 A:middle
manufacturers and have them work

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:14.056 A:middle
together.

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:16.186 A:middle
HomeKit makes it easy for you to

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:17.546 A:middle
choose the accessory that's

00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:18.196 A:middle
right for your home.

00:12:18.786 --> 00:12:21.786 A:middle
Now, with AirPlay 2, we've added

00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:23.016 A:middle
support for adding speakers to

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:24.186 A:middle
the Home app.

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:27.186 A:middle
And in iOS 12, we're also

00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:28.476 A:middle
releasing support for remote

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:29.316 A:middle
control systems.

00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:32.016 A:middle
Now you can create a remote

00:12:32.016 --> 00:12:33.846 A:middle
control accessory that's able to

00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:36.306 A:middle
control your Apple TV, including

00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:37.156 A:middle
support for Siri.

00:12:37.766 --> 00:12:41.166 A:middle
Now that we've given a quick

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.166 A:middle
recap of the benefits of using

00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:45.646 A:middle
HomeKit, let's dive in and see

00:12:45.646 --> 00:12:47.266 A:middle
what resources are available for

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.266 A:middle
making a HomeKit accessory.

00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:51.716 A:middle
So the easiest way to get

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:53.046 A:middle
started with HomeKit and

00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:54.406 A:middle
building an accessory is to

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.746 A:middle
become an MFI licensee.

00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:58.906 A:middle
It's a great program with lots

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:00.016 A:middle
