00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:00.696 A:middle
Now, this resource is also

00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:02.196 A:middle
available to MFI licensees,

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.226 A:middle
which is another great benefit

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:05.226 A:middle
of being part of the program.

00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:07.576 A:middle
And this is built on top of that

00:19:07.576 --> 00:19:08.716 A:middle
HomeKit Accessory Tester.

00:19:09.196 --> 00:19:10.886 A:middle
Now, this allows you to

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:13.776 A:middle
self-certify your accessory and

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:16.006 A:middle
even has support for automating

00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:17.356 A:middle
some of that testing process.

00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:21.626 A:middle
And the third tool I want to

00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:23.096 A:middle
talk about is the HomeKit

00:19:23.096 --> 00:19:24.156 A:middle
Accessory Simulator.

00:19:25.186 --> 00:19:27.026 A:middle
Now, this is a tool that's

00:19:27.026 --> 00:19:29.186 A:middle
created for app developers, and

00:19:29.186 --> 00:19:30.816 A:middle
so it will simulate various

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:31.486 A:middle
accessories.

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:34.646 A:middle
Now, this allows you to test

00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:36.466 A:middle
your app and make sure it plays

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:37.896 A:middle
with all the HomeKit accessory

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
categories.

00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:40.436 A:middle
Now, the really nice thing about

00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:41.636 A:middle
this is it means you don't need

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.866 A:middle
to go out and buy each one of

00:19:42.866 --> 00:19:43.946 A:middle
these accessories to do your

00:19:43.946 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
testing.

00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:48.546 A:middle
You can get this tool available

00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:50.256 A:middle
through Xcode and also through

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.126 A:middle
the MFI program.

00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:54.126 A:middle
And this is actually one of the

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.786 A:middle
tools that we use internally, as

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:56.986 A:middle
it's a great way to quickly and

00:19:56.986 --> 00:19:59.066 A:middle
easily set up a complex home

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.116 A:middle
with lots of accessories.
