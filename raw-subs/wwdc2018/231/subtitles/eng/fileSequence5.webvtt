00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:00.926 A:middle
favorite way to control my

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
HomeKit accessories.

00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:03.576 A:middle
Not only is it a great music

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:06.836 A:middle
speaker, it's also a great way

00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:07.676 A:middle
to control your HomeKit

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.566 A:middle
accessories because anyone in

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:11.236 A:middle
your house can use it using just

00:05:11.236 --> 00:05:11.756 A:middle
their voice.

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:15.276 A:middle
This hands-free Siri interface

00:05:15.936 --> 00:05:17.126 A:middle
allows you to quickly and easily

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:18.206 A:middle
control these accessories in

00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:18.636 A:middle
your home.

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:21.226 A:middle
It's really simple to get

00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:23.286 A:middle
started, and I love using my

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:24.946 A:middle
HomePod to control the lights in

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:25.486 A:middle
my house.

00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:27.996 A:middle
It's especially convenient when

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:29.556 A:middle
I walk into the kitchen with my

00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:31.736 A:middle
arms full of stuff, and I can

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:33.096 A:middle
use my voice to tell Siri to

00:05:33.096 --> 00:05:33.806 A:middle
turn on the lights.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.086 A:middle
Now, we've also gotten a lot of

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.496 A:middle
feedback from users saying they

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:41.036 A:middle
love using their HomePod to

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.056 A:middle
trigger their good night scene.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:44.466 A:middle
They simply tell Siri good night

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:45.506 A:middle
as they head off to bed.

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:50.356 A:middle
Now, the HomePod also plays a

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.816 A:middle
much more powerful role in the

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.946 A:middle
home, as it helps control remote

00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:58.686 A:middle
access and automations.

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.846 A:middle
Now, remote access is one of my
