00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:31.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:34.026 A:middle
My name is Keith Rauenbuehler,

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:35.006 A:middle
and I'm from the HomeKit

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:35.796 A:middle
Engineering team.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.906 A:middle
Now, today we're here to talk

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.706 A:middle
about HomeKit with a focus on

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.936 A:middle
three specific areas.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.156 A:middle
First, we'll give an overview of

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:47.086 A:middle
HomeKit and the Home app.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.686 A:middle
Then, we'll outline what it

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:50.286 A:middle
takes to build a HomeKit

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:50.796 A:middle
accessory.

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.686 A:middle
And finally, we'll look at some

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.206 A:middle
HomeKit APIs and how to use

00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:56.016 A:middle
them.

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.146 A:middle
So let's jump right in.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.186 A:middle
So the best way to really
