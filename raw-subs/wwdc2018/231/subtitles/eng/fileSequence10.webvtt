Apple can't listen in on your

00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:02.056 A:middle
conversations.

00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:03.726 A:middle
Apple can't even tell if you

00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:04.796 A:middle
have a light bulb turned on or

00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:05.046 A:middle
off.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.216 A:middle
We know your home is private,

00:10:07.216 --> 00:10:08.976 A:middle
and we want to keep it that way.

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:11.316 A:middle
So you can monitor your home,

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:14.376 A:middle
control accessories, execute

00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:16.536 A:middle
scenes, and even use full Siri

00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:17.836 A:middle
support all in a secure and

00:10:17.836 --> 00:10:18.296 A:middle
private way.

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
We want this communication to be

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:24.726 A:middle
super secure, and so all

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.076 A:middle
messaging is done directly

00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:28.466 A:middle
between the Apple device and the

00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:29.066 A:middle
accessory.

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:32.016 A:middle
So your accessory never needs to

00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:35.306 A:middle
talk to the cloud.

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:36.136 A:middle
In addition to this being

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.956 A:middle
secure, it's also really fast

00:10:38.456 --> 00:10:40.226 A:middle
because all the messaging is

00:10:40.226 --> 00:10:42.846 A:middle
done locally and there's no need

00:10:42.846 --> 00:10:44.000 A:middle
to round trip to a server.

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:51.756 A:middle
Now, our HomeKit Accessory

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:53.636 A:middle
Protocol is the communication

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:55.216 A:middle
channel for secure messaging

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:56.576 A:middle
between an accessory and your

00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:57.276 A:middle
Apple device.

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.616 A:middle
These messages are encrypted so
