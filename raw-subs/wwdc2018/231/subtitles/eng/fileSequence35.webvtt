00:34:57.626 --> 00:35:00.256 A:middle
them happen every day, or maybe

00:35:00.256 --> 00:35:01.086 A:middle
you want them just to happen

00:35:01.086 --> 00:35:03.246 A:middle
every weekday, or even just

00:35:03.246 --> 00:35:04.036 A:middle
every Friday.

00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:06.416 A:middle
So with automations, you have a

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:07.766 A:middle
lot of control with the

00:35:07.766 --> 00:35:09.146 A:middle
frequency and how often you want

00:35:09.146 --> 00:35:10.066 A:middle
automations to run.

00:35:12.636 --> 00:35:14.096 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at the

00:35:14.096 --> 00:35:16.096 A:middle
creation of an HMTrigger and how

00:35:16.096 --> 00:35:16.816 A:middle
we add it to the home.

00:35:18.006 --> 00:35:19.266 A:middle
So let's say we want to create

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:20.316 A:middle
an automation that will run

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:23.026 A:middle
every night at 7 p.m.

00:35:23.296 --> 00:35:25.616 A:middle
So first, we create our date

00:35:25.616 --> 00:35:26.956 A:middle
components and we set the time

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:27.896 A:middle
to be 7 p.m.

00:35:29.186 --> 00:35:30.706 A:middle
Then, we'll create a calendar

00:35:30.706 --> 00:35:32.376 A:middle
event using that component.

00:35:34.556 --> 00:35:36.096 A:middle
Then, we'll generate a trigger

00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:37.166 A:middle
using that time event.

00:35:37.676 --> 00:35:40.776 A:middle
Now, we need to add that trigger

00:35:40.776 --> 00:35:41.286 A:middle
to the home.

00:35:41.856 --> 00:35:44.476 A:middle
And we need to add the action

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:45.226 A:middle
set to the trigger.

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:48.436 A:middle
So this allows you to run an

00:35:48.436 --> 00:35:50.356 A:middle
automation every night at 7 p.m.

00:35:50.946 --> 00:35:52.176 A:middle
So let's say it's turning on a

00:35:52.176 --> 00:35:55.396 A:middle
light every night at 7 p.m.

00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:56.856 A:middle
Now, that's great, except for

00:35:56.856 --> 00:35:59.576 A:middle
sometimes, some parts of the

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:01.206 A:middle
year, it's not dark at 7 p.m.,
