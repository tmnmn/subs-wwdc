00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.846 A:middle
Now, remote access is one of my

00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.766 A:middle
favorite features in HomeKit, as

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.936 A:middle
it allows you to monitor your

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:07.286 A:middle
home when you're not there.

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:09.826 A:middle
So you can have peace of mind,

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
and you can check to make sure

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:14.206 A:middle
your garage door is closed or

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.196 A:middle
make sure your thermostat's

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:16.006 A:middle
turned off when you're not at

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:16.396 A:middle
home.

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:18.586 A:middle
And you can do this all while

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:19.086 A:middle
being remote.

00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:21.716 A:middle
Now, this feature requires a

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:25.666 A:middle
home hub, but HomePod, Apple TV,

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:27.536 A:middle
and iPad have the home hub

00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:32.236 A:middle
functionality built right in.

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.956 A:middle
So with remote access, you can

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.436 A:middle
keep tabs on your home while

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:35.756 A:middle
you're away.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:38.136 A:middle
And you may also want to share

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:39.856 A:middle
some of this support from this

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.486 A:middle
control with other users.

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:43.876 A:middle
With HomeKit, you have control

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.316 A:middle
over granting remote access to

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:47.276 A:middle
some users and then specifying

00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:48.536 A:middle
other users to only control

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.646 A:middle
accessories while locally.

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:53.186 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit about

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:54.526 A:middle
how remote access works.

00:06:55.956 --> 00:06:56.936 A:middle
So when you're in your home,

00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:59.626 A:middle
your Apple device communicates

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
directly with your accessories.
