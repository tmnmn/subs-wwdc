00:28:59.826 --> 00:29:02.186 A:middle
that also because it gets

00:29:02.186 --> 00:29:03.426 A:middle
confusing to the user on how

00:29:03.426 --> 00:29:05.176 A:middle
they want, when they want to

00:29:09.036 --> 00:29:09.546 A:middle
address their accessory.

00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:12.216 A:middle
Now, we support over 40

00:29:12.216 --> 00:29:13.586 A:middle
predefined service types.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:16.106 A:middle
So things like light bulbs,

00:29:16.246 --> 00:29:17.776 A:middle
thermostats, garage door

00:29:17.776 --> 00:29:19.816 A:middle
openers, outlets, and all kinds

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:20.906 A:middle
of sensors, to name a few.

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.376 A:middle
We also allow the ability to

00:29:23.376 --> 00:29:25.126 A:middle
specify custom service types as

00:29:25.126 --> 00:29:25.356 A:middle
well.

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:29.866 A:middle
Now, when it comes to adding the

00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:31.916 A:middle
accessory to the home, you'll

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.206 A:middle
want to go back to the HMHome

00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:34.296 A:middle
helper methods.

00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:36.616 A:middle
These APIs are pretty simple to

00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:38.366 A:middle
use, but we'll walk through an

00:29:38.366 --> 00:29:39.666 A:middle
example shortly here anyway.

00:29:40.276 --> 00:29:44.916 A:middle
So the addAccessory API, this

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.646 A:middle
API is what invokes the Home UI

00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:48.766 A:middle
view service, which is that

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.836 A:middle
familiar addAccessory flow that

00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:52.796 A:middle
I mentioned earlier, which is

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:54.816 A:middle
how you can do quick QR code

00:29:54.816 --> 00:29:56.676 A:middle
scanning or use NFC to add an

00:29:56.676 --> 00:29:58.156 A:middle
accessory to the home.
