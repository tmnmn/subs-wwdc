trigger automations.

Automations can be as simple as

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:06.866 A:middle
turning on the back porch light

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:09.476 A:middle
when the back door opens or

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:11.886 A:middle
turning down the air conditioner

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.926 A:middle

your lights, open your shades,

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.546 A:middle
and set your thermostat to just

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:29.066 A:middle
the right temperature all as you

00:08:29.066 --> 00:08:29.916 A:middle
pull into your driveway.

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:31.516 A:middle
Now, this is one of my favorite

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.895 A:middle
automations, as I'm frequently

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:37.606 A:middle
juggling groceries, or kids, or

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:38.846 A:middle
even finishing up a phone call

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:39.796 A:middle
as I get home.

00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:41.576 A:middle

house without needing to fumble

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.356 A:middle

your home network.
