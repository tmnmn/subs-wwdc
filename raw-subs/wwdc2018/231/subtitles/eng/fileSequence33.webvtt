00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.676 A:middle
APIs because this allows you to

00:33:01.676 --> 00:33:04.376 A:middle
add these action sets, execute

00:33:04.376 --> 00:33:08.076 A:middle
the action sets, and the HMHome

00:33:08.266 --> 00:33:10.136 A:middle
APIs also expose the way of

00:33:11.576 --> 00:33:13.536 A:middle
accessing the built-in action

00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:18.476 A:middle
sets.

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:19.666 A:middle
So if we look at some quick

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:21.506 A:middle
sample code, we'll see that if

00:33:21.506 --> 00:33:23.816 A:middle
we want to create an action set,

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:26.316 A:middle
we call addActionSet withName on

00:33:26.316 --> 00:33:27.916 A:middle
the home, we pass in the name of

00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:30.306 A:middle
the action set, then we'll want

00:33:30.366 --> 00:33:32.106 A:middle
to iterate through our list of

00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:35.076 A:middle
actions and add each one to the

00:33:35.076 --> 00:33:35.706 A:middle
action set.

00:33:37.656 --> 00:33:39.626 A:middle
Then, later, if we want to run

00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:42.216 A:middle
the scene, all you do is call

00:33:42.426 --> 00:33:44.396 A:middle
executeActionSet on the home.

00:33:48.636 --> 00:33:50.266 A:middle
Now, running scenes via the UI

00:33:50.266 --> 00:33:52.786 A:middle
or via Siri is great, but

00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:53.626 A:middle
sometimes you want things to

00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:54.606 A:middle
happen automatically.

00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:57.326 A:middle
Now, we have several options for

00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:58.936 A:middle
automatically triggering scenes

00:33:59.116 --> 00:34:00.256 A:middle
and automatically controlling
