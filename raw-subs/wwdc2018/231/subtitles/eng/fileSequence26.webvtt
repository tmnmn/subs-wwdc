00:25:59.406 --> 00:26:01.666 A:middle
hierarchy that's important is

00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:02.536 A:middle
the relationship between

00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:04.526 A:middle
accessories, services, and

00:26:04.526 --> 00:26:05.336 A:middle
characteristics.

00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.786 A:middle
Now, this can sound confusing,

00:26:08.106 --> 00:26:10.236 A:middle
as accessories contain services

00:26:10.376 --> 00:26:11.496 A:middle
and services contain

00:26:11.496 --> 00:26:12.306 A:middle
characteristics.

00:26:13.296 --> 00:26:14.146 A:middle
So it's best to look at a

00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:15.976 A:middle
real-world example to give you

00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:16.866 A:middle
an idea how, really how this

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:17.406 A:middle
fits together.

00:26:17.966 --> 00:26:20.776 A:middle
So let's say you have a ceiling

00:26:20.776 --> 00:26:21.476 A:middle
fan fixture.

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:26.126 A:middle
Now, this is a single accessory,

00:26:26.436 --> 00:26:31.426 A:middle
and it has a light, and it has a

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:31.956 A:middle
fan.

00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:37.156 A:middle
So this maps to a light service

00:26:38.586 --> 00:26:40.326 A:middle
and a fan service.

00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:43.766 A:middle
Now, these services have a set

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:45.456 A:middle
of common characteristics that

00:26:45.456 --> 00:26:47.036 A:middle
are shared across all services,

00:26:47.386 --> 00:26:48.656 A:middle
but they also have

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:50.396 A:middle
characteristics that are unique

00:26:50.396 --> 00:26:51.296 A:middle
to their service.

00:26:52.326 --> 00:26:54.196 A:middle
So the light service has

00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.016 A:middle
characteristics like power,

00:26:56.416 --> 00:26:58.016 A:middle
brightness, and saturation.

00:26:58.526 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
And the fan service has
