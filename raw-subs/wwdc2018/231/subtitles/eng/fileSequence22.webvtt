00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
The HMZone contains HMRooms.

00:22:02.506 --> 00:22:04.336 A:middle
And the HMRoom contains

00:22:04.396 --> 00:22:05.206 A:middle
HMAccessories.

00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:10.516 A:middle
Now, the home has a handful of

00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:12.836 A:middle
properties on it, but the home

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:14.076 A:middle
is really used as the central

00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:15.836 A:middle
organizing object for HomeKit.

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:18.866 A:middle
So the home is how you add

00:22:18.866 --> 00:22:21.296 A:middle
accessories, configure rooms,

00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:23.936 A:middle
create scenes, and build

00:22:23.936 --> 00:22:24.706 A:middle
automations.

00:22:26.076 --> 00:22:27.566 A:middle
But some users may have more

00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:29.726 A:middle
than one home, and so you'll

00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:32.306 A:middle
need to use the HMHomeManager to

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.646 A:middle
help manage these homes.

00:22:34.546 --> 00:22:36.106 A:middle
So if you want to add a new home

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.936 A:middle
or remove an existing home,

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:39.876 A:middle
that's done through the

00:22:39.876 --> 00:22:41.086 A:middle
HMHomeManager APIs.

00:22:45.376 --> 00:22:46.636 A:middle
Now, the great thing about

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:48.616 A:middle
HomeKit is you can extend home

00:22:48.616 --> 00:22:50.556 A:middle
control to other users.

00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:53.866 A:middle
We also have access control

00:22:53.866 --> 00:22:55.336 A:middle
capabilities so you can give a

00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:57.066 A:middle
spouse or a roommate full

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:58.136 A:middle
administrative privileges.

00:22:58.956 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
Now, as an administrator, they,
