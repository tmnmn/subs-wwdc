00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:00.766 A:middle
Then, we'll create a significant

00:37:00.766 --> 00:37:03.266 A:middle
time event for sunset and pass

00:37:03.266 --> 00:37:03.926 A:middle
in that offset.

00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:06.836 A:middle
Then, when we generate our

00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:08.766 A:middle
trigger, we pass in the sunset

00:37:08.766 --> 00:37:09.036 A:middle
event.

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.156 A:middle
Then, we execute the code we had

00:37:13.156 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
before, which is adding the

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.796 A:middle
trigger to the home and adding

00:37:16.796 --> 00:37:17.966 A:middle
the action set to the trigger.

00:37:22.456 --> 00:37:23.906 A:middle
But sometimes you don't want

00:37:23.906 --> 00:37:25.016 A:middle
these automations to run.

00:37:26.226 --> 00:37:27.456 A:middle
You probably don't want the heat

00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:28.596 A:middle
to turn on in the morning if no

00:37:28.596 --> 00:37:29.156 A:middle
one's home.

00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:31.706 A:middle
You probably don't want the

00:37:31.706 --> 00:37:32.896 A:middle
light to turn on when the door

00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:37.256 A:middle
opens if it's during the day.

00:37:37.496 --> 00:37:39.316 A:middle
So we also support what we call

00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:40.056 A:middle
conditions.

00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:43.646 A:middle
And these can be time based,

00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:46.616 A:middle
they can be presence based, they

00:37:47.236 --> 00:37:50.546 A:middle
can be accessory state based,

00:37:51.116 --> 00:37:54.346 A:middle
and they can be based on

00:37:54.346 --> 00:37:55.366 A:middle
significant events.

00:37:55.736 --> 00:38:00.476 A:middle
Now, I have an automation in my
