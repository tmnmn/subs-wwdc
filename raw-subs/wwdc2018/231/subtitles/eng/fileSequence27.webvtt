00:26:58.526 --> 00:27:00.476 A:middle
And the fan service has

00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:02.296 A:middle
characteristics like power,

00:27:02.586 --> 00:27:04.176 A:middle
rotation speed, and rotation

00:27:04.176 --> 00:27:04.676 A:middle
direction.

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.606 A:middle
Now, some of these

00:27:07.606 --> 00:27:08.906 A:middle
characteristics are optional.

00:27:09.736 --> 00:27:11.206 A:middle
As you can imagine, not all

00:27:11.206 --> 00:27:12.836 A:middle
lights support saturation and

00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:13.146 A:middle
color.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:17.116 A:middle
But the HomeKit APIs expose

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:19.306 A:middle
these as a way to elevate these

00:27:19.306 --> 00:27:20.446 A:middle
services to your user.

00:27:21.756 --> 00:27:22.746 A:middle
So we look back.

00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:25.936 A:middle
We have the ceiling fan fixture,

00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:27.206 A:middle
which is the HMAccessory.

00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:31.166 A:middle
We have the light service and

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:32.576 A:middle
the fan service, which are the

00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:33.366 A:middle
HMServices.

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:35.896 A:middle
And we have the corresponding

00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:37.316 A:middle
characteristics, which are the

00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:38.336 A:middle
HMCharacteristics.

00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:43.086 A:middle
So we look, if you look at the

00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:45.866 A:middle
API for some of this, you could

00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:48.326 A:middle
see we have HMAccessory, and

00:27:48.326 --> 00:27:49.506 A:middle
this allows you to learn about

00:27:49.506 --> 00:27:50.206 A:middle
the accessory that you're

00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:50.726 A:middle
controlling.

00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:53.966 A:middle
So this exposes properties like

00:27:53.966 --> 00:27:57.116 A:middle
the name, the list of services

00:27:57.116 --> 00:28:00.386 A:middle
it supports, and the firmware
