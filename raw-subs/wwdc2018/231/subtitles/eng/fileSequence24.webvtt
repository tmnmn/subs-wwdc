00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.116 A:middle
will instantiate an

00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
HMHomeManager.

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:04.696 A:middle
Now, we want to add a home to

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:06.636 A:middle
that home manager, so we'll use

00:24:06.636 --> 00:24:08.736 A:middle
the addHome APIs and specify the

00:24:08.736 --> 00:24:09.596 A:middle
name of the home.

00:24:10.546 --> 00:24:12.296 A:middle
Now, we want to be sure to set

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:13.826 A:middle
ourselves as the delegate, so

00:24:13.826 --> 00:24:14.616 A:middle
we'll get the appropriate

00:24:14.616 --> 00:24:15.696 A:middle
delegate callbacks.

00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:18.226 A:middle
And finally, if we want to

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:19.256 A:middle
configure the users for the

00:24:19.256 --> 00:24:22.256 A:middle
home, we'll call manageUsers on

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:22.646 A:middle
HMHome.

00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:29.166 A:middle
Now, I mentioned HMZones

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.506 A:middle
earlier, so let's take a little

00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:31.776 A:middle
peek at that.

00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:32.786 A:middle
So this is a way of grouping

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:35.206 A:middle
multiple rooms together, like

00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:39.026 A:middle
upstairs and downstairs, or you

00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:40.426 A:middle
can group all the bedrooms

00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:41.736 A:middle
together in a single zone.

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:44.866 A:middle
So it has some basic properties

00:24:44.866 --> 00:24:47.166 A:middle
on it like name and access to

00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:48.936 A:middle
the rooms, but it also has this

00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.316 A:middle
unique identifier property.

00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:52.326 A:middle
And this could often be

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:53.686 A:middle
overlooked, but this is a way

00:24:53.686 --> 00:24:54.776 A:middle
that you keep track of which

00:24:54.776 --> 00:24:55.836 A:middle
zone you're, you care about.

00:24:56.256 --> 00:24:58.026 A:middle
So when the name changes or the

00:24:58.026 --> 00:24:59.876 A:middle
rooms change, you still have an

00:24:59.876 --> 00:25:03.956 A:middle
access to that specific zone.
