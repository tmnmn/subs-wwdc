00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
Now, I want to call special

00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:03.556 A:middle
attention to the last method

00:30:03.556 --> 00:30:05.366 A:middle
here, which is addAnd

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:06.606 A:middle
SetupAccessories with payload.

00:30:06.606 --> 00:30:10.546 A:middle
Now, you can use that payload to

00:30:10.546 --> 00:30:12.346 A:middle
pass in a HomeKit accessory code

00:30:13.026 --> 00:30:14.736 A:middle
for in-field activation cases.

00:30:15.476 --> 00:30:17.656 A:middle
So this API is especially

00:30:17.656 --> 00:30:18.656 A:middle
valuable for software

00:30:18.656 --> 00:30:19.196 A:middle
authentication.

00:30:19.336 --> 00:30:22.236 A:middle
So this is the case where your

00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:24.566 A:middle
accessory has left the factory

00:30:24.566 --> 00:30:26.526 A:middle
without a HomeKit code on it.

00:30:27.136 --> 00:30:29.196 A:middle
So you've updated the accessory

00:30:30.106 --> 00:30:31.906 A:middle
via firmware update to provide

00:30:31.906 --> 00:30:33.936 A:middle
HomeKit support, and you don't

00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:35.136 A:middle
want the user to have to

00:30:35.136 --> 00:30:37.636 A:middle
memorize the HomeKit code or to

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:38.496 A:middle
write it down.

00:30:38.856 --> 00:30:40.716 A:middle
And so this API allows you to

00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:42.286 A:middle
pass in that HomeKit code so

00:30:42.326 --> 00:30:44.496 A:middle
that this accessory can be

00:30:44.496 --> 00:30:45.856 A:middle
seamlessly added to the home.

00:30:46.436 --> 00:30:50.226 A:middle
Now, this API is available to

00:30:50.226 --> 00:30:51.316 A:middle
MFI licensees.

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:53.846 A:middle
For more information, contact

00:30:53.846 --> 00:30:54.906 A:middle
your MFI representative.

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.126 A:middle
So if we look at some sample
