00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.096 A:middle
To toggle the state of it, just

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:01.866 A:middle
tap on the tile.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.106 A:middle
So if you want to turn on a

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:06.286 A:middle
light, all you need to do is tap

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:07.726 A:middle
on the tile for it.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.016 A:middle
Now, if you want finer-grain

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.096 A:middle
control, you can use 3D touch to

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
bring up our quick controls.

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:18.716 A:middle
And so if we go back to that

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.686 A:middle
same light and we want to adjust

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.146 A:middle
the overall brightness -- say

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:23.876 A:middle
it's a dimmer switch -- we can

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.296 A:middle
3D press on the tile, and we can

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.196 A:middle
bring up our quick controls.

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:33.806 A:middle
Now, we've also added scenes to

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:35.716 A:middle
the Home app, and scenes are a

00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:37.266 A:middle
great way to allow you control--

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:38.636 A:middle
allow you to control multiple

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:40.876 A:middle
accessories with a single tap.

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:43.406 A:middle
A scene is our simple interface

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.016 A:middle
for tying multiple accessories

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:46.716 A:middle
together, whether it's kicking

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.406 A:middle
off your morning routine or

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:50.536 A:middle
setting up your living room to

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.536 A:middle
the perfect movie-watching

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:51.956 A:middle
environment.

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:53.866 A:middle
Now, throughout the day, your

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:54.826 A:middle
home is always changing.

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:56.666 A:middle
People may come and go.

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:59.276 A:middle
Lights might turn on or off.

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:00.996 A:middle
Blinds can open and close.
