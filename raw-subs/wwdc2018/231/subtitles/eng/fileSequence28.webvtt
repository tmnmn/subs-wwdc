00:27:57.116 --> 00:28:00.386 A:middle
it supports, and the firmware

00:28:00.386 --> 00:28:01.096 A:middle
version it's running.

00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:04.766 A:middle
Now, this is just a subsample of

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:05.916 A:middle
all the properties on the

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:06.486 A:middle
accessory.

00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:07.586 A:middle
I just wanted to give you an

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:09.056 A:middle
idea of the sense of what types

00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.486 A:middle
of properties are on it.

00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:13.946 A:middle
So if we take a look at

00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:16.526 A:middle
HMService, we'll see that it

00:28:16.746 --> 00:28:17.786 A:middle
exposes the list of

00:28:17.836 --> 00:28:20.966 A:middle
characteristics, and there's a

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:23.546 A:middle
setter method for updating the

00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:24.330 A:middle
name.

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:25.856 A:middle
Now, updating the name is

00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:27.016 A:middle
actually pretty important.

00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:30.716 A:middle
So why is it important?

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:32.346 A:middle
Well, it's important because

00:28:32.346 --> 00:28:33.996 A:middle
this is how Siri and the Home

00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:35.116 A:middle
app will interface with your

00:28:35.116 --> 00:28:35.556 A:middle
accessory.

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.786 A:middle
So you'll want to choose a good

00:28:38.786 --> 00:28:39.476 A:middle
default name.

00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:42.846 A:middle
So we, you don't want to use

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:44.696 A:middle
serial numbers, or MAC

00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:47.246 A:middle
addresses, or model numbers in

00:28:47.246 --> 00:28:48.236 A:middle
your service name because

00:28:48.236 --> 00:28:49.696 A:middle
that'll make it challenging for

00:28:49.696 --> 00:28:51.146 A:middle
the user to talk to your

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.076 A:middle
accessory through Siri.

00:28:52.676 --> 00:28:56.206 A:middle
You also don't-- want to avoid

00:28:56.206 --> 00:28:57.736 A:middle
special characters and numbers,

00:28:58.086 --> 00:28:59.826 A:middle
emojis, punctuation, things like

00:28:59.826 --> 00:29:02.186 A:middle
that also because it gets
