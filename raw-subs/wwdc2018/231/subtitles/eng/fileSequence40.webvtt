00:40:02.646 --> 00:40:03.876 A:middle
So here you could see we have a

00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.796 A:middle
function where we want to start

00:40:05.996 --> 00:40:06.936 A:middle
the camera stream for our

00:40:06.936 --> 00:40:07.326 A:middle
accessory.

00:40:07.326 --> 00:40:11.256 A:middle
Now, we want to be sure to set

00:40:11.256 --> 00:40:13.076 A:middle
ourselves as the delegate so we

00:40:13.076 --> 00:40:14.106 A:middle
can get the proper delegate

00:40:14.106 --> 00:40:14.716 A:middle
callbacks.

00:40:16.896 --> 00:40:18.496 A:middle
Now, we'll use this start stream

00:40:18.496 --> 00:40:21.796 A:middle
API to start the stream, and we

00:40:21.796 --> 00:40:23.376 A:middle
also want to be sure to create a

00:40:23.376 --> 00:40:26.576 A:middle
camera view and to add that view

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:27.826 A:middle
to our view hierarchy.

00:40:28.466 --> 00:40:29.866 A:middle
This is so we can display that

00:40:29.866 --> 00:40:31.466 A:middle
camera stream in our app.

00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:36.016 A:middle
Then, later, we'll get the

00:40:36.016 --> 00:40:36.926 A:middle
delegate callback.

00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:38.286 A:middle
Again, this is the

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.036 A:middle
HMCameraStream ControlDelegate.

00:40:41.716 --> 00:40:42.836 A:middle
And we'll receive this

00:40:42.946 --> 00:40:45.046 A:middle
cameraStreamControl

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:46.326 A:middle
DidStartStream delegate

00:40:46.326 --> 00:40:46.756 A:middle
callback.

00:40:48.296 --> 00:40:49.576 A:middle
And all we need to do there is

00:40:49.576 --> 00:40:51.496 A:middle
set the camera source to be the

00:40:51.496 --> 00:40:52.116 A:middle
camera stream.

00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:55.286 A:middle
Now, this is the end of the

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.686 A:middle
sample code for today, but

00:40:57.686 --> 00:40:59.096 A:middle
there's plenty of documentation

00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:01.016 A:middle
available for these APIs online.
