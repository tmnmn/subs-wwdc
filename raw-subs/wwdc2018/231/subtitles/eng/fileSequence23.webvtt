00:22:58.956 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
Now, as an administrator, they,

00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:03.666 A:middle
these users can add accessories,

00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:04.626 A:middle
edit scenes.

00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:06.696 A:middle
They basically have full control

00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:07.546 A:middle
over the home.

00:23:09.316 --> 00:23:10.806 A:middle
But you may only want to give

00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:12.806 A:middle
some users normal access to the

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:14.606 A:middle
home and only allow them to

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:16.596 A:middle
control accessories and not edit

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:16.906 A:middle
them.

00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:18.446 A:middle
And those are

00:23:18.446 --> 00:23:19.806 A:middle
non-administrators.

00:23:21.186 --> 00:23:22.216 A:middle
Now, the important take-away

00:23:22.216 --> 00:23:23.136 A:middle
here is that if you're building

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:25.236 A:middle
an app, you want to make sure

00:23:25.236 --> 00:23:27.946 A:middle
that if your HM user is not an

00:23:27.946 --> 00:23:29.846 A:middle
administrator that you disable

00:23:29.846 --> 00:23:31.986 A:middle
some key functionality so that

00:23:31.986 --> 00:23:33.216 A:middle
it doesn't fail when they go try

00:23:33.216 --> 00:23:35.866 A:middle
and use it.

00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:38.236 A:middle
Again, all this user management

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:39.586 A:middle
is done through the HMHome

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:42.116 A:middle
object, and you'll quickly see

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.346 A:middle
that this is a common design

00:23:43.346 --> 00:23:45.786 A:middle
pattern we use where the HMHome

00:23:46.146 --> 00:23:47.376 A:middle
exposes a lot of the basic

00:23:47.376 --> 00:23:47.996 A:middle
functionality.

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:51.776 A:middle
So let's take a look at some

00:23:51.776 --> 00:23:52.946 A:middle
sample code and see what this

00:23:52.946 --> 00:23:53.316 A:middle
looks like.

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:58.876 A:middle
So here we have a class where we

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.116 A:middle
will instantiate an
