00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:02.896 A:middle
they trust that their accessory

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.816 A:middle
has been tested thoroughly and

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:05.556 A:middle
reviewed by Apple.

00:17:06.096 --> 00:17:08.175 A:middle
Now, this process is similar to

00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:10.455 A:middle
the App Store review process, so

00:17:10.455 --> 00:17:11.316 A:middle
on the HomeKit side, we have a

00:17:11.316 --> 00:17:12.925 A:middle
way of reviewing accessories.

00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:15.536 A:middle
This is so they, we ensure that

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:16.705 A:middle
they meet our high bar of

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:18.476 A:middle
quality and that they're ready

00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:20.026 A:middle
to be shipped to customers.

00:17:20.486 --> 00:17:23.386 A:middle
Now, once an accessory is

00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:26.626 A:middle
certified, it uses our

00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:27.616 A:middle
authentication stack for

00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:28.046 A:middle
onboarding.

00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:30.976 A:middle
This helps guarantee that a

00:17:30.976 --> 00:17:31.666 A:middle
customer is getting that

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:32.456 A:middle
high-quality product.

00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:34.596 A:middle
Now, the authentication itself

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.216 A:middle
can be done using our hardware

00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:38.046 A:middle
chip or via our new

00:17:38.076 --> 00:17:39.216 A:middle
software-based authentication.

00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:43.786 A:middle
Now, as an MFI licensee, you'll

00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:45.136 A:middle
also have access to

00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:46.666 A:middle
manufacturing partners that can

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:47.686 A:middle
help get your product to market.

00:17:48.506 --> 00:17:49.766 A:middle
So if you're sitting in the

00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:51.316 A:middle
crowd today with a great idea

00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:53.036 A:middle
for a HomeKit accessory, this is

00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:55.376 A:middle
your big opportunity to bring it

00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:57.926 A:middle
to the home.

00:17:57.926 --> 00:17:59.206 A:middle
Now, we've always supported

00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:00.826 A:middle
hardware-based authentication,
