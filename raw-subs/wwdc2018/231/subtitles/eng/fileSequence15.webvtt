[ Applause ]

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:03.496 A:middle
Now, the HomeKit ADK is new, but

00:15:03.776 --> 00:15:04.796 A:middle
we've already gotten a ton of

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:06.416 A:middle
great feedback from our partners

00:15:06.646 --> 00:15:07.906 A:middle
on how simple it is to use.

00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:10.376 A:middle
MFI licensees are finding it

00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:12.256 A:middle
easier than ever to get started,

00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:13.526 A:middle
and we're seeing that the

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:15.226 A:middle
ramp-up time for new partners is

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:16.246 A:middle
faster than ever before.

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:18.976 A:middle
And of course, the ADK is

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:20.976 A:middle
reliable and secure, as we've

00:15:20.976 --> 00:15:22.336 A:middle
tested it thoroughly internally,

00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:23.536 A:middle
and it's been reviewed by our

00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:24.326 A:middle
security folks.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:26.986 A:middle
Now, the really nice thing about

00:15:26.986 --> 00:15:29.066 A:middle
the ADK is that we'll continue

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:29.946 A:middle
to update it throughout the

00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:31.896 A:middle
year, so whenever there's an iOS

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:33.846 A:middle
update that releases new support

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.456 A:middle
for accessories or to the spec,

00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:37.766 A:middle
we'll also rev the ADK so that

00:15:37.906 --> 00:15:38.926 A:middle
it'll stay in sync.

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:43.016 A:middle
So how much faster is it to use

00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:43.956 A:middle
the ADK?

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:46.816 A:middle
Well, with the ADK, you can

00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:48.336 A:middle
build a functional prototype and

00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:49.416 A:middle
have it up and running within

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:49.906 A:middle
just a week.

00:15:51.446 --> 00:15:52.336 A:middle
But let's look at how that

00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:53.776 A:middle
impacts the overall timeline.

00:15:54.326 --> 00:15:58.716 A:middle
So previously, our partners were

00:15:58.716 --> 00:16:00.306 A:middle
spending about 6 months for
