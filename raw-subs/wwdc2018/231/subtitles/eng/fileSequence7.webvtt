00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.506 A:middle
directly with your accessories.

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:04.176 A:middle
But when you leave your home,

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:07.236 A:middle
you'll need a home hub -- again,

00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:09.556 A:middle
this is a HomePod, an Apple TV,

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.546 A:middle
or an iPad -- and your iPhone

00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:13.606 A:middle
will communicate with your home

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:15.606 A:middle
hub, and your home hub will talk

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:16.616 A:middle
to your accessories directly.

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
You can look at the latest state

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:21.656 A:middle
of these accessories.

00:07:22.086 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
You can view the stream from one

00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.116 A:middle
of your cameras.

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:26.416 A:middle
You can even lock your door if

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.456 A:middle
you've forgotten to secure your

00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:28.556 A:middle
house before you left for the

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:29.283 A:middle
day.

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.336 A:middle
Now, we saw earlier how easy it

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:32.926 A:middle
to leverage scenes to get

00:07:32.926 --> 00:07:33.996 A:middle
devices to work together.

00:07:34.506 --> 00:07:35.916 A:middle
Now, scenes are great, but

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:37.186 A:middle
automations allow you to run

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:38.276 A:middle
scenes automatically.

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:41.166 A:middle
So you can do so without

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
launching the Home app or using

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:46.396 A:middle
your voice.

00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:47.846 A:middle
Automations allow you to control

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:50.446 A:middle
individual accessories or entire

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:51.876 A:middle
scenes based on some key

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:53.796 A:middle
triggers -- things like someone

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:56.116 A:middle
arriving home or having it run

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:57.336 A:middle
at a specific time of the day.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
You can even use other
