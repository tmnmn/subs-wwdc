00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:00.986 A:middle
and characteristics.

00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:04.416 A:middle
Now, with HomeKit, there's a lot

00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:05.546 A:middle
of APIs that I'm going to talk

00:21:05.546 --> 00:21:07.736 A:middle
about today, but before I get

00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:09.416 A:middle
into the details, I think it's

00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:10.666 A:middle
important to take a look at a

00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:13.246 A:middle
high level at the object

00:21:13.246 --> 00:21:13.786 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:21:14.376 --> 00:21:16.896 A:middle
So the first class that I want

00:21:16.896 --> 00:21:18.876 A:middle
to tell you about is this core

00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:20.286 A:middle
object, which is the HMHome.

00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:23.376 A:middle
Now, this is corresponds to the

00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:27.556 A:middle
overall home, and within the

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:28.676 A:middle
HMHome,

00:21:28.736 --> 00:21:30.196 A:middle
you can also optionally have

00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:30.866 A:middle
HMZones.

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:32.786 A:middle
Now, these are things like

00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:34.136 A:middle
upstairs and downstairs.

00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:36.526 A:middle
Now, you could also have

00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:38.566 A:middle
HMRooms, and these are the rooms

00:21:38.816 --> 00:21:39.726 A:middle
that are normally associated

00:21:39.726 --> 00:21:41.246 A:middle
with the home -- the kitchen,

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.706 A:middle
the living room, the dining

00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:45.376 A:middle
room, the bedroom.

00:21:45.626 --> 00:21:47.656 A:middle
And within those rooms, you can

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:48.626 A:middle
have HMAccessories.

00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:50.506 A:middle
And these are the lights, the

00:21:50.506 --> 00:21:52.516 A:middle
fans, the cameras, the locks,

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:54.206 A:middle
all the normal accessories we

00:21:54.206 --> 00:21:54.636 A:middle
support.

00:21:56.076 --> 00:21:57.826 A:middle
So your home, the HMHome

00:21:57.826 --> 00:21:59.196 A:middle
contains HMZones.

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
The HMZone contains HMRooms.
