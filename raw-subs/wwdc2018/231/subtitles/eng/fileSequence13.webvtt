00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:00.016 A:middle
of valuable tools that I can't

00:13:00.016 --> 00:13:00.896 A:middle
wait to tell you all about.

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:03.386 A:middle
Now, if you just want to learn

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:04.356 A:middle
about the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:06.066 A:middle
Protocol, we also have that

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:07.416 A:middle
available for developers.

00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:09.776 A:middle
Now, this is for noncommercial

00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:11.706 A:middle
use to explore and experiment

00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:12.766 A:middle
with the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:13.226 A:middle
Protocol.

00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:16.056 A:middle
So this is great for learning

00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:17.286 A:middle
about the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:18.906 A:middle
Protocol, but if you're serious

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:19.756 A:middle
about building a HomeKit

00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:22.026 A:middle
accessory, we really encourage

00:13:22.026 --> 00:13:24.106 A:middle
you to join the MFI program

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:25.626 A:middle
because it's the best way to get

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:26.466 A:middle
off to a quick start.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:30.096 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit

00:13:30.096 --> 00:13:32.076 A:middle
about, what are the benefits of

00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:36.086 A:middle
being part of the MFI program?

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:37.846 A:middle
So becoming an MFI is really

00:13:37.846 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
easy, and you'll get lots of

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:40.266 A:middle
tools and resources.

00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:42.396 A:middle
And one of the newest tools that

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:44.056 A:middle
we're really excited about is

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.046 A:middle
the HomeKit Accessory

00:13:45.046 --> 00:13:46.916 A:middle
Development Kit.

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:48.046 A:middle
This is an easy way to get

00:13:48.046 --> 00:13:50.006 A:middle
started on building a HomeKit

00:13:50.006 --> 00:13:50.486 A:middle
accessory.

00:13:51.076 --> 00:13:53.506 A:middle
Now, this Dis a set of code that

00:13:53.506 --> 00:13:55.606 A:middle
runs on the accessory to help

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:56.736 A:middle
abstract away a lot of the

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.076 A:middle
implementation details that you

00:13:58.076 --> 00:13:59.346 A:middle
previously have to worry about.

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
Now, we also have tools to help
