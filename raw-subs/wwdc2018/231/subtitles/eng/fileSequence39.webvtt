00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:02.256 A:middle
Then, we'll go back to the same

00:39:02.256 --> 00:39:04.286 A:middle
code we had before where we add

00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:06.646 A:middle
the trigger to the home and we

00:39:07.226 --> 00:39:09.326 A:middle
add the action set to the

00:39:12.876 --> 00:39:13.046 A:middle
trigger.

00:39:13.206 --> 00:39:14.656 A:middle
So now, we've gone from having

00:39:14.656 --> 00:39:16.086 A:middle
an automation that runs every

00:39:16.086 --> 00:39:18.916 A:middle
night at 7 p.m. to an automation

00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:22.116 A:middle
that runs every night 30 minutes

00:39:22.116 --> 00:39:25.216 A:middle
before sunset, only if someone's

00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:26.000 A:middle
home.

00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.426 A:middle
Now, we also have support for

00:39:33.426 --> 00:39:34.406 A:middle
HomeKit cameras.

00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:37.416 A:middle
And there are some HomeKit APIs

00:39:38.796 --> 00:39:40.256 A:middle
that allow you to show live

00:39:40.256 --> 00:39:44.446 A:middle
streams, show still images, and

00:39:44.446 --> 00:39:45.866 A:middle
to configure camera settings.

00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:48.896 A:middle
You-- this support also includes

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:51.006 A:middle
the ability to control the

00:39:51.006 --> 00:39:52.286 A:middle
speaker volume and microphone.

00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:56.066 A:middle
So let's take a quick look at

00:39:56.126 --> 00:39:57.516 A:middle
some sample code for that as

00:39:57.916 --> 00:39:58.000 A:middle
well.
