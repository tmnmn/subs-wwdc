00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.976 A:middle
Let's start with the tools.

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:05.846 A:middle
This is the most important

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:06.416 A:middle
message.

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:08.886 A:middle
You should profile early and do

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:09.496 A:middle
it often.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:12.456 A:middle
Do not ship your game unless

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:13.276 A:middle
you've profiled it.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.756 A:middle
And for that you will need to

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:16.486 A:middle
know your tools.

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:19.626 A:middle
Today, I will focus on two of

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:19.966 A:middle
them.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:22.746 A:middle
First, we have instruments,

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.406 A:middle
which is our main profiling

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:24.656 A:middle
tool.

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:26.336 A:middle
You will want to use it to

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.966 A:middle
understand performance, latency,

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:30.266 A:middle
and overall timing.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:33.246 A:middle
Second, we have the Metal Frame

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:34.936 A:middle
Debugger, which is also very

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:37.066 A:middle
powerful tool, which you will

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.466 A:middle
want to use to debug your GPU

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:38.976 A:middle
workload.

00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:41.776 A:middle
So where do we start?

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.306 A:middle
This is a question we often get.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.026 A:middle
Well, this year we are making it

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:47.756 A:middle
easier for you.

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:49.246 A:middle
We are introducing a new

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:51.146 A:middle
instruments template, which will

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:52.706 A:middle
be a great starting point.

00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:54.446 A:middle
The Game Performance Template.

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:56.776 A:middle
It is the combination of already

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.796 A:middle
existing instruments such as

00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:02.346 A:middle
System Trace, Time Profiler, and
