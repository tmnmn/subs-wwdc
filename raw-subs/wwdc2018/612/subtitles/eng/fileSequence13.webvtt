00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:00.746 A:middle
consistent from the get-go.

00:13:01.216 --> 00:13:03.836 A:middle
Our frame spends on display more

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:04.976 A:middle
time it takes to render.

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:07.326 A:middle
Every frame will be consistent.

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.746 A:middle
The user will see also being

00:13:10.746 --> 00:13:11.336 A:middle
consistent.

00:13:12.196 --> 00:13:12.866 A:middle
And that's great.

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
Also notice that there's a side

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:15.476 A:middle
effect.

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.096 A:middle
The frame rate will be lowered.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:18.356 A:middle
We went from 40 frames per

00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:20.426 A:middle
second to 30 frames per second.

00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:22.596 A:middle
So that also gave us some extra

00:13:22.596 --> 00:13:23.596 A:middle
frame time to play with.

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:26.296 A:middle
So how did we do this?

00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:31.056 A:middle
How did we fix the-- the frame

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:31.616 A:middle
pacing?

00:13:31.816 --> 00:13:34.606 A:middle
Well, really it's just a couple

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:35.406 A:middle
of lines of code.

00:13:36.156 --> 00:13:37.406 A:middle
We have the same pattern as

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:37.856 A:middle
before.

00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:39.176 A:middle
We rendered the scene.

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:40.746 A:middle
We get the next drawable.

00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:42.336 A:middle
We do the final pass.

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:45.066 A:middle
The only difference here is that

00:13:45.066 --> 00:13:47.226 A:middle
we specify a minimum duration

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:47.986 A:middle
for our frame.

00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:50.416 A:middle
And present it with that minimum

00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:50.916 A:middle
duration.

00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:52.666 A:middle
That's all it takes.

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:54.786 A:middle
That will allow us to set the

00:13:54.786 --> 00:13:56.576 A:middle
minimum duration for our frames.

00:13:56.576 --> 00:13:58.056 A:middle
And they will all be consistent.

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.916 A:middle
And after doing so, you may be
