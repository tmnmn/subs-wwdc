00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.526 A:middle
help the system.

00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:02.626 A:middle
You know what's best for your

00:23:02.626 --> 00:23:04.876 A:middle
game to keep being awesome under

00:23:04.876 --> 00:23:05.216 A:middle
stress.

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:07.906 A:middle
Some recommendations I'll give

00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.856 A:middle
you though are to target the

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:11.616 A:middle
frame rate that can be sustained

00:23:11.616 --> 00:23:12.966 A:middle
for the entire game session.

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:16.026 A:middle
For example, stay at 30 frames

00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:17.966 A:middle
per second if you cannot sustain

00:23:17.966 --> 00:23:20.026 A:middle
60 for ten minutes or more.

00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:24.376 A:middle
Doing the GPU work is also super

00:23:24.376 --> 00:23:24.886 A:middle
helpful.

00:23:26.046 --> 00:23:27.476 A:middle
For example, consider lowering

00:23:27.476 --> 00:23:28.966 A:middle
the resolution of intermediate

00:23:28.966 --> 00:23:31.976 A:middle
render targets, or simply find

00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:34.286 A:middle
the shadow maps, loading simpler

00:23:34.286 --> 00:23:36.576 A:middle
assets and even removing some of

00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:38.006 A:middle
the post-processes altogether.

00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:40.256 A:middle
Wherever, whatever fits your

00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:40.926 A:middle
game the best.

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:44.836 A:middle
You should decide that one.

00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:46.796 A:middle
And this will bring us to the

00:23:46.796 --> 00:23:48.036 A:middle
next issue on our list.

00:23:49.206 --> 00:23:50.186 A:middle
That about dealing with

00:23:50.186 --> 00:23:51.486 A:middle
unnecessary GPU work.

00:23:52.026 --> 00:23:53.486 A:middle
For that, please welcome my

00:23:53.486 --> 00:23:54.746 A:middle
colleague Ohad on stage.

00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:55.916 A:middle
He's going to tell you all about

00:23:55.916 --> 00:23:55.983 A:middle
it.

00:23:56.516 --> 00:23:59.756 A:middle
