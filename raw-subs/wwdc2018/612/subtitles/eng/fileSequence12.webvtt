00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:00.956 A:middle
We've just seen the problem, how

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
it occurs in the real world.

00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:03.926 A:middle
The pattern is basically the

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:04.296 A:middle
same.

00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:07.026 A:middle
So how do we go about fixing it?

00:12:07.636 --> 00:12:09.596 A:middle
The best practice here is to

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:10.976 A:middle
target the frame rate your game

00:12:10.976 --> 00:12:11.516 A:middle
can achieve.

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:13.966 A:middle
So at the minimum frame duration

00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:15.866 A:middle
there is longer than the time it

00:12:15.866 --> 00:12:16.696 A:middle
takes to render.

00:12:18.006 --> 00:12:19.586 A:middle
For that, there's a bunch of

00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:20.696 A:middle
APIs that can help you.

00:12:21.326 --> 00:12:23.016 A:middle
For example, MT Drawable

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:25.096 A:middle
addPresentedHandler will give

00:12:25.096 --> 00:12:26.746 A:middle
you a call back once that

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.786 A:middle
drawable is presented.

00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:29.206 A:middle
So you can identify micro

00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:30.956 A:middle
stuttering as it is happening.

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:33.916 A:middle
The other two APIs will help you

00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:35.436 A:middle
to actually fix the problem.

00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:36.816 A:middle
They will allow you to

00:12:36.816 --> 00:12:38.406 A:middle
explicitly control the frame

00:12:38.406 --> 00:12:39.816 A:middle
rating-- the frame pacing.

00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:41.776 A:middle
In this case we have present

00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:43.836 A:middle
afterMinimumDuration and present

00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:44.246 A:middle
atTime.

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:46.396 A:middle
What we want to do here?

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.496 A:middle
We set the minimum duration for

00:12:48.496 --> 00:12:50.436 A:middle
our frame longer than it takes

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:50.826 A:middle
to render.

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:53.256 A:middle
And we'll do just that.

00:12:53.256 --> 00:12:55.796 A:middle
Let's see how that looks.

00:12:56.036 --> 00:12:57.276 A:middle
Notice that when we start

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.306 A:middle
rendering, we are already

00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:00.746 A:middle
consistent from the get-go.
