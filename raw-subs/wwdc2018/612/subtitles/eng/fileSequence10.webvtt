00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:03.846 A:middle
Now this may appear in different

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:05.156 A:middle
shapes and forms in the real

00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:05.476 A:middle
world.

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:07.796 A:middle
So what we'll do now is a quick

00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:09.236 A:middle
demo and I'll show you an

00:10:09.236 --> 00:10:11.356 A:middle
instruments trace of the Talos

00:10:11.356 --> 00:10:11.956 A:middle
Principle.

00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:13.806 A:middle
And we will use to see if we can

00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:15.246 A:middle
identify micro stuttering in the

00:10:15.246 --> 00:10:17.000 A:middle
real world case.

00:10:25.356 --> 00:10:25.756 A:middle
Okay.

00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:27.836 A:middle
So what we see here is the same

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.436 A:middle
lot of information I've shown

00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:30.026 A:middle
you before.

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:31.666 A:middle
This has been captured with the

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
Game Performance Template by

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:33.426 A:middle
default.

00:10:34.326 --> 00:10:35.666 A:middle
Notice all the same instruments

00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:38.186 A:middle
I talked about here displayed on

00:10:39.276 --> 00:10:39.636 A:middle
the left.

00:10:39.636 --> 00:10:41.506 A:middle
And all the game threads here in

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:41.896 A:middle
the middle.

00:10:42.766 --> 00:10:43.936 A:middle
In particular though, we are

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:46.556 A:middle
looking now at micro stuttering.

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:48.766 A:middle
So this quite intuitively will

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:50.206 A:middle
bring us to look at the display

00:10:50.206 --> 00:10:51.966 A:middle
track because micro stuttering

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:53.176 A:middle
by definition is frames

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:54.466 A:middle
presented inconsistently.

00:10:55.226 --> 00:10:56.166 A:middle
In this case, we have the

00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:57.106 A:middle
display track here.

00:10:58.576 --> 00:10:59.716 A:middle
Notice as well that there are

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.796 A:middle
some hints in the display track.
