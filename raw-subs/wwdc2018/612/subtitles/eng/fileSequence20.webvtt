00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.866 A:middle
work of the CPUs so we can run

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:01.316 A:middle
instead.

00:20:02.616 --> 00:20:04.316 A:middle
The user does not see the

00:20:04.316 --> 00:20:04.826 A:middle
stutter.

00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:07.656 A:middle
Your game can run at 30 solid

00:20:07.656 --> 00:20:09.766 A:middle
frames per second, even though

00:20:09.766 --> 00:20:11.216 A:middle
the system is under heavy load.

00:20:11.976 --> 00:20:13.646 A:middle
That is technically awesome, and

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:14.586 A:middle
that's what this is all about.

00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:16.386 A:middle
So let's see how we make this

00:20:16.386 --> 00:20:19.006 A:middle
happen with a little bit of

00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:19.866 A:middle
code.

00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:21.946 A:middle
And it literally is a little bit

00:20:21.946 --> 00:20:22.326 A:middle
of code.

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:23.766 A:middle
It is only like a couple lines.

00:20:24.826 --> 00:20:27.386 A:middle
In this case, it's just about

00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:28.396 A:middle
configuring the pthread

00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:30.616 A:middle
attributes before we can create

00:20:30.616 --> 00:20:31.116 A:middle
the pthread.

00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:33.826 A:middle
We need to opt out of quality of

00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:36.716 A:middle
service, set the priority to 45.

00:20:38.086 --> 00:20:38.576 A:middle
And that's it.

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:39.966 A:middle
We can create the pthread with

00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:41.586 A:middle
those attributes, and it will

00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:42.366 A:middle
work just fine.

00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:44.836 A:middle
It is simple and technically

00:20:44.836 --> 00:20:45.236 A:middle
awesome.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:49.906 A:middle
What's not so simple though is

00:20:49.906 --> 00:20:51.256 A:middle
the next issue on our list.

00:20:52.636 --> 00:20:54.106 A:middle
That about dealing with multiple

00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:55.456 A:middle
thermal states.

00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:57.766 A:middle
The message is very clear.

00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:00.896 A:middle
Design for sustained performance
