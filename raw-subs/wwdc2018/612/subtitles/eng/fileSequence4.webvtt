00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:01.546 A:middle
In this case, the orange color

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.496 A:middle
you can see means that there are

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:05.336 A:middle
more runnable threads available

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.486 A:middle
than CPU cores.

00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:08.206 A:middle
So there is some contingency.

00:04:09.076 --> 00:04:10.746 A:middle
These will offer a great view of

00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:11.376 A:middle
the system.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:14.226 A:middle
There's a couple of great talks

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:15.696 A:middle
that talk about this instrument

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:16.326 A:middle
in more depth.

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:20.216 A:middle
Please follow-up on them.

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:22.626 A:middle
Next on our list is Metal System

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.406 A:middle
Trace, our GPU profiling tool.

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:26.576 A:middle
It offers a great view of the

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:27.326 A:middle
graphic stack.

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:29.306 A:middle
All the way from the Metal

00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:31.346 A:middle
Framework down to the display.

00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:34.586 A:middle
In particular, we will want to

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:36.256 A:middle
pay close attention to the GPU

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:38.106 A:middle
[inaudible], which is split in

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:40.826 A:middle
vertex, fragment, and compute if

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:41.646 A:middle
your game uses it.

00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:44.286 A:middle
Notice as well that the display

00:04:44.286 --> 00:04:45.626 A:middle
track will be the starting point

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:46.896 A:middle
of many of our investigations.

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:49.196 A:middle
We will identify a long frame or

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:50.686 A:middle
a starter and we will work it

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:51.666 A:middle
all the way up from there.

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:53.436 A:middle
So it's a very natural place to

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:53.776 A:middle
start.

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:57.916 A:middle
There is a lot of information

00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:59.106 A:middle
about the tool because it really

00:04:59.106 --> 00:05:00.416 A:middle
is a very powerful tool.
