00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.136 A:middle
So this is going to be the main

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:01.846 A:middle
topic today.

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:03.696 A:middle
Develop Awesome Games.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.686 A:middle
But I will only be providing

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:07.846 A:middle
technical directions here.

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:09.026 A:middle
So we'll [inaudible].

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:13.516 A:middle
Before we begin, please let me

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:14.916 A:middle
thank our friends at Croteam.

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:16.766 A:middle
They are the developers behind

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.476 A:middle
The Talos Principle, which is a

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:19.576 A:middle
really awesome game.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:21.016 A:middle
You will see it featured in

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:22.256 A:middle
these slides and in two of the

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:22.696 A:middle
demos.

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:26.176 A:middle
Notice that it has stunning

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:28.336 A:middle
visuals but it does really not

00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:29.696 A:middle
compromise in performance.

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:30.996 A:middle
And that's what this is all

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:31.266 A:middle
about.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.566 A:middle
So let's do a quick run through

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.186 A:middle
of the agenda.

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:37.736 A:middle
I'll start with an introduction

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:38.306 A:middle
to the tools.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:39.986 A:middle
This is a very good place to

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:40.376 A:middle
start.

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.526 A:middle
And then we'll talk about the

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:43.816 A:middle
actual performance issues.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.086 A:middle
Around frame pacing, thread

00:01:46.146 --> 00:01:48.366 A:middle
priorities, thermal states, and

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:49.966 A:middle
unnecessary GPU work.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.376 A:middle
Even though all these issues

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:54.716 A:middle
seem unrelated, they will

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:55.916 A:middle
compound and aggravate each

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:56.236 A:middle
other.

00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:57.956 A:middle
So it's important to tackle them

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:58.146 A:middle
all.

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.976 A:middle
Let's start with the tools.
