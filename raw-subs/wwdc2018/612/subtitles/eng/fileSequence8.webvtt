00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.376 A:middle
After all, we are targeting 60

00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:02.226 A:middle
frames per second, right?

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:04.636 A:middle
There's also another class of

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:05.926 A:middle
problems that will cause micro

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:06.616 A:middle
stuttering.

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:09.976 A:middle
And some games are already

00:08:10.016 --> 00:08:11.496 A:middle
targeting lower frame rate.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:14.056 A:middle
But we have also identified many

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:16.326 A:middle
of those games that are using

00:08:16.326 --> 00:08:18.086 A:middle
usleep on their main or random

00:08:18.086 --> 00:08:18.416 A:middle
thread.

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:20.846 A:middle
This is a very bad practice in

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:22.716 A:middle
iOS, so please don't do that and

00:08:22.716 --> 00:08:25.056 A:middle
just hang, hang here for the

00:08:25.056 --> 00:08:25.766 A:middle
next few minutes.

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:26.806 A:middle
And I'll tell you the actual

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.956 A:middle
correct way of doing this in

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:30.626 A:middle
iOS.

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:33.676 A:middle
Now, let's have a deeper look

00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:36.395 A:middle
into what happens in the system

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:37.566 A:middle
for micro stuttering to be

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:38.086 A:middle
visible.

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.316 A:middle
In this case, we see here a

00:08:40.316 --> 00:08:41.905 A:middle
timeline of all the components

00:08:41.905 --> 00:08:42.936 A:middle
involved in rendering.

00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:46.386 A:middle
And we'll start rendering our

00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:47.196 A:middle
game normally.

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:49.226 A:middle
Notice this is a three-point

00:08:49.226 --> 00:08:50.376 A:middle
buffer case, which is quite

00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:51.286 A:middle
common in iOS.

00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:53.526 A:middle
In this case, every drawable is

00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:55.376 A:middle
represented by a letter and a

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:55.776 A:middle
color.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.186 A:middle
And also notice the premise

00:08:58.186 --> 00:08:58.406 A:middle
here.

00:08:59.056 --> 00:09:01.556 A:middle
Rendering to drawable V takes
