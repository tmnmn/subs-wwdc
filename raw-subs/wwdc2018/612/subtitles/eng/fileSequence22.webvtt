00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.366 A:middle
low power mode condition in a

00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:02.216 A:middle
similar fashion.

00:22:03.026 --> 00:22:05.396 A:middle
Also consider querying the GPU

00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:07.086 A:middle
start/GPU end time from the MTL

00:22:07.086 --> 00:22:08.966 A:middle
Command Buffer in order to

00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:11.206 A:middle
understand how system loads may

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:12.466 A:middle
impact the GPU time.

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:15.876 A:middle
Let's see how we do that with a

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:17.136 A:middle
simple code example.

00:22:18.456 --> 00:22:19.546 A:middle
This comes straight from our

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:20.396 A:middle
best practices.

00:22:21.286 --> 00:22:23.606 A:middle
A tip score is a very simple

00:22:23.606 --> 00:22:25.646 A:middle
switch statement when every case

00:22:25.686 --> 00:22:27.216 A:middle
corresponds to a thermal state.

00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:32.886 A:middle
We have nominal, fair, serious,

00:22:33.836 --> 00:22:34.476 A:middle
and critical.

00:22:34.996 --> 00:22:39.416 A:middle
And that is all very good.

00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:41.106 A:middle
So now we know that we are in a

00:22:41.106 --> 00:22:43.546 A:middle
thermal state and thse command's

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.126 A:middle
telling us to do something about

00:22:45.126 --> 00:22:45.216 A:middle
it.

00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:48.536 A:middle
So how can, how can we actually

00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:49.906 A:middle
help the system stay cool?

00:22:51.096 --> 00:22:53.936 A:middle
Well, I can give you some

00:22:53.936 --> 00:22:55.626 A:middle
suggestions, but it's up to you

00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:57.096 A:middle
game developers to decide what

00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:59.616 A:middle
compromises to make in order to

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.526 A:middle
help the system.
