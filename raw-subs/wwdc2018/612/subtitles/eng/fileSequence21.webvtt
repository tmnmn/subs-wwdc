Design for sustained performance

00:21:01.416 --> 00:21:04.106 A:middle
and deal with the occasional

00:21:04.106 --> 00:21:04.856 A:middle
thermal issues.

00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:07.056 A:middle
So let's see how we go about

00:21:07.806 --> 00:21:07.926 A:middle
that.

00:21:08.616 --> 00:21:10.926 A:middle
iOS devices give you access to

00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:12.206 A:middle
an unprecedented amount of

00:21:12.296 --> 00:21:12.656 A:middle
power.

00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:14.336 A:middle
But [inaudible] in a very small

00:21:14.336 --> 00:21:15.076 A:middle
form factor.

00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:17.826 A:middle
So more apps use more resources

00:21:17.826 --> 00:21:20.386 A:middle
on the device, the system may

00:21:20.386 --> 00:21:22.156 A:middle
begin enacting measures in order

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:24.186 A:middle
to stay cool and responsive.

00:21:25.246 --> 00:21:27.876 A:middle
Also the user may have enabled a

00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:30.136 A:middle
low power mode condition, which

00:21:30.136 --> 00:21:32.196 A:middle
will have a very similar effect.

00:21:32.696 --> 00:21:36.506 A:middle
Okay, so the best practice

00:21:36.506 --> 00:21:38.946 A:middle
really is just to adjust your

00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:41.016 A:middle
workload to the system state.

00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:43.716 A:middle
You should monitor the system

00:21:43.856 --> 00:21:44.726 A:middle
and tune the workload

00:21:44.726 --> 00:21:45.296 A:middle
accordingly.

00:21:45.996 --> 00:21:47.996 A:middle
iOS has many APIs to help you

00:21:47.996 --> 00:21:48.366 A:middle
with that.

00:21:48.996 --> 00:21:51.526 A:middle
For example, use NSProcessInfo

00:21:51.606 --> 00:21:53.776 A:middle
thermalState to either query or

00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:55.786 A:middle
register for notification when

00:21:55.786 --> 00:21:56.686 A:middle
the device thermal state

00:21:56.686 --> 00:21:57.116 A:middle
changes.

00:21:57.946 --> 00:21:59.026 A:middle
You should also check for the

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.366 A:middle
low power mode condition in a
