00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.246 A:middle
Now as I zoom out, the first

00:29:03.246 --> 00:29:03.986 A:middle
thing you'll notice that the

00:29:03.986 --> 00:29:05.856 A:middle
statistics hide and the focus

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:07.076 A:middle
goes away from the individual

00:29:07.076 --> 00:29:09.176 A:middle
passes onto the frame as a

00:29:09.176 --> 00:29:09.506 A:middle
whole.

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:12.376 A:middle
And I can zoom out even more to

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:14.506 A:middle
see a great bird's-eye view of

00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:15.546 A:middle
my entire frame.

00:29:16.026 --> 00:29:18.566 A:middle
Now the really cool thing to

00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:20.196 A:middle
notice here is that since

00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:21.446 A:middle
dependencies drive the

00:29:21.446 --> 00:29:24.716 A:middle
connectivity of the graph, each

00:29:24.716 --> 00:29:26.466 A:middle
logical piece of work is grouped

00:29:26.466 --> 00:29:27.606 A:middle
together in space.

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.586 A:middle
So let's zoom in and see what I

00:29:29.586 --> 00:29:29.766 A:middle
mean.

00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:31.826 A:middle
Here I have a branch of work

00:29:32.256 --> 00:29:33.676 A:middle
that's creating my shadow maps.

00:29:34.336 --> 00:29:37.436 A:middle
On the left, I can see three

00:29:37.436 --> 00:29:39.866 A:middle
passes that are rendering the

00:29:39.866 --> 00:29:40.516 A:middle
shadows.

00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:42.526 A:middle
So this is really fantastic

00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:44.496 A:middle
because I'm not just getting the

00:29:44.496 --> 00:29:46.026 A:middle
story of my entire frame.

00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:48.056 A:middle
But there's another story in

00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:49.286 A:middle
between these two layers.

00:29:49.786 --> 00:29:51.036 A:middle
One of how each rendering

00:29:51.036 --> 00:29:53.476 A:middle
technique is built up.

00:29:53.476 --> 00:29:54.866 A:middle
And this is something that isn't

00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:56.496 A:middle
always entirely obvious when

00:29:56.496 --> 00:29:57.506 A:middle
you're using a game engine to

00:29:57.506 --> 00:29:58.136 A:middle
turn these on.

00:29:58.536 --> 00:29:59.506 A:middle
For instance, when my shadow

00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:01.956 A:middle
maps, I may not have known that
