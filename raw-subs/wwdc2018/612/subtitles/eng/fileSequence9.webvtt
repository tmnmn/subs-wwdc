00:08:59.056 --> 00:09:01.556 A:middle
Rendering to drawable V takes

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:03.506 A:middle
longer than one display refresh

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:05.026 A:middle
interval, which is the time

00:09:05.026 --> 00:09:05.926 A:middle
between vsyncs.

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:09.236 A:middle
In this case, could be 25

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:11.096 A:middle
millisecond to render to V and

00:09:11.096 --> 00:09:13.036 A:middle
16.6 millisecond in between

00:09:13.036 --> 00:09:14.216 A:middle
display refresh intervals.

00:09:15.936 --> 00:09:18.546 A:middle
So since that is the premise,

00:09:18.596 --> 00:09:20.976 A:middle
this means that we will need to

00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:22.376 A:middle
[inaudible] on the display for

00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:24.426 A:middle
the next interval to give time

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:25.606 A:middle
so we can finish.

00:09:26.826 --> 00:09:27.766 A:middle
And we will do so.

00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:29.496 A:middle
And that during that interval,

00:09:29.876 --> 00:09:31.856 A:middle
we will actually B, B will

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:32.816 A:middle
actually finish.

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:35.046 A:middle
And we will be ready to present

00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.896 A:middle
it but notice that we have just

00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:38.996 A:middle
hid the issue here.

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:41.456 A:middle
During this interval, we have

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.046 A:middle
also finished rendering to C.

00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:44.856 A:middle
And we are ready to present it

00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:45.406 A:middle
right away.

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:47.736 A:middle
So we will [inaudible] an

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:50.066 A:middle
inconsistent frame pacing from

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:50.996 A:middle
that moment onward.

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:52.996 A:middle
We are stuck in this pattern.

00:09:53.556 --> 00:09:54.856 A:middle
Every other frame will be

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:55.596 A:middle
inconsistent.

00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:57.876 A:middle
And the user will see micro

00:09:57.876 --> 00:09:58.446 A:middle
stuttering.
