&gt;&gt; Thank you, Guillem.

00:24:01.516 --> 00:24:04.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:04.636 --> 00:24:05.516 A:middle
Hey, everyone.

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.616 A:middle
My name is Ohad, and I'm a

00:24:07.616 --> 00:24:08.946 A:middle
member of the Game Technologies

00:24:09.036 --> 00:24:09.756 A:middle
Team here at Apple.

00:24:10.826 --> 00:24:12.836 A:middle
In the previous slides, Guillem

00:24:12.836 --> 00:24:14.736 A:middle
showed you how important it is

00:24:14.896 --> 00:24:16.026 A:middle
to adapt to the system.

00:24:17.276 --> 00:24:19.286 A:middle
Responding to states like low

00:24:19.286 --> 00:24:20.856 A:middle
power mode or the varying

00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:23.076 A:middle
thermal states will require you

00:24:23.076 --> 00:24:24.866 A:middle
to tune your GPU workload in

00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:26.236 A:middle
order to maintain consistent

00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:27.546 A:middle
frame rates throughout an entire

00:24:27.546 --> 00:24:28.146 A:middle
game session.

00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:31.206 A:middle
However, for many developers,

00:24:31.406 --> 00:24:33.346 A:middle
the GPU is a bit of a black box

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:35.126 A:middle
hidden behind the curtains of a

00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:35.696 A:middle
game engine.

00:24:36.436 --> 00:24:38.036 A:middle
Today, we'll pull back those

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:38.456 A:middle
curtains.

00:24:40.506 --> 00:24:42.816 A:middle
Wasted GPU time is a very common

00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:44.686 A:middle
problem and it's one that often

00:24:44.686 --> 00:24:45.756 A:middle
goes unnoticed.

00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:47.436 A:middle
But I want you to remember this.

00:24:47.776 --> 00:24:49.646 A:middle
Technically awesome games don't

00:24:49.646 --> 00:24:51.116 A:middle
only hit their GPU budget.

00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:53.886 A:middle
They're also good citizens to

00:24:53.886 --> 00:24:55.636 A:middle
the system, helping it to stay

00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:57.276 A:middle
cool and save power.

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.246 A:middle
All the popular game engines

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:00.676 A:middle
provide a great list of best
