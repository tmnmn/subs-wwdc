00:25:59.186 --> 00:26:00.316 A:middle
you're only halfway there.

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:02.326 A:middle
Next you want to really

00:26:02.326 --> 00:26:04.166 A:middle
understand what each of your

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:05.526 A:middle
passes is doing.

00:26:07.006 --> 00:26:08.916 A:middle
And for this, we're added a new

00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:10.466 A:middle
tool to the Metal Frame Debugger

00:26:10.466 --> 00:26:10.896 A:middle
this year.

00:26:11.496 --> 00:26:13.486 A:middle
It's the Dependency graph.

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:17.586 A:middle
The Dependency graph is a story

00:26:17.586 --> 00:26:18.716 A:middle
of a single frame.

00:26:20.196 --> 00:26:21.866 A:middle
It's made up of nodes and edges

00:26:22.016 --> 00:26:23.426 A:middle
and each one of these tell a

00:26:23.426 --> 00:26:24.546 A:middle
different part of the story.

00:26:25.846 --> 00:26:28.146 A:middle
Edges represent dependencies

00:26:28.446 --> 00:26:29.486 A:middle
between passes.

00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:31.186 A:middle
As you follow them from top to

00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:32.786 A:middle
bottom, you'll see where each

00:26:32.786 --> 00:26:34.046 A:middle
pass fits into your rendering

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:34.516 A:middle
pipeline.

00:26:34.776 --> 00:26:36.616 A:middle
And how they work together to

00:26:36.616 --> 00:26:37.446 A:middle
create your frame.

00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:40.666 A:middle
Nodes on the other hand are the

00:26:40.666 --> 00:26:43.326 A:middle
story of a single pass.

00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:45.366 A:middle
They're made up of three main

00:26:45.366 --> 00:26:46.066 A:middle
components.

00:26:46.526 --> 00:26:48.966 A:middle
First, the title element will

00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:49.966 A:middle
give you the name of the pass.

00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:51.846 A:middle
Now I really want to emphasize

00:26:51.846 --> 00:26:52.236 A:middle
this.

00:26:52.706 --> 00:26:53.636 A:middle
Label everything.

00:26:54.136 --> 00:26:55.266 A:middle
It'll help you not only in the

00:26:55.266 --> 00:26:56.626 A:middle
Dependency viewer, but

00:26:56.626 --> 00:26:57.886 A:middle
throughout our entire suite of

00:26:57.886 --> 00:26:58.356 A:middle
tools.

00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:01.176 A:middle
Secondly, it'll allow you to
