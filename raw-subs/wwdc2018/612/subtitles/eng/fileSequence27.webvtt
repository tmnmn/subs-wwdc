00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:01.176 A:middle
Secondly, it'll allow you to

00:27:01.236 --> 00:27:03.256 A:middle
quickly tell what type of pass

00:27:03.256 --> 00:27:04.676 A:middle
you're looking at.

00:27:04.966 --> 00:27:06.896 A:middle
Render, blit, or compute.

00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:08.956 A:middle
Here from the icon we can see

00:27:08.956 --> 00:27:10.896 A:middle
that it's a render pass.

00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:12.916 A:middle
Next, you have a list of

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:14.596 A:middle
statistics describing the work

00:27:14.596 --> 00:27:16.766 A:middle
being done in this pass.

00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:18.696 A:middle
And finally to the bottom, a

00:27:18.696 --> 00:27:20.736 A:middle
list of all the resources that

00:27:20.736 --> 00:27:22.326 A:middle
are being written to during this

00:27:22.326 --> 00:27:23.976 A:middle
pass, and each of these also

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.936 A:middle
comed with a label, a thumbnail

00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:26.916 A:middle
allowing you to preview your

00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:28.996 A:middle
work, and a list of information

00:27:28.996 --> 00:27:30.476 A:middle
describing each one of those

00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:31.866 A:middle
resources specifically.

00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:35.036 A:middle
And all that together allows you

00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:36.516 A:middle
to really understand each of

00:27:36.516 --> 00:27:37.066 A:middle
your passes.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.616 A:middle
Okay, so now we know how to read

00:27:39.616 --> 00:27:40.126 A:middle
the graph.

00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:42.226 A:middle
Let's jump into a demo and see

00:27:42.226 --> 00:27:44.000 A:middle
how it all fits together.

00:27:52.726 --> 00:27:52.836 A:middle
Okay.

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:55.226 A:middle
So I have the Fox II demo

00:27:55.486 --> 00:27:56.606 A:middle
running on my machine here.

00:27:57.196 --> 00:27:58.906 A:middle
It was built in Scene Kit, which

00:27:58.906 --> 00:28:00.336 A:middle
allowed me to add all sorts of
