00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:01.966 A:middle
Well, this issue's known as

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:04.206 A:middle
micro stuttering or inconsistent

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:04.756 A:middle
frame pace.

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:08.896 A:middle
It occurs when the frame time is

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.206 A:middle
higher than the display refresh

00:07:10.206 --> 00:07:10.646 A:middle
interval.

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:14.096 A:middle
For example, our game may take

00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:16.726 A:middle
25 milliseconds to render or 40

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:17.606 A:middle
frames per second.

00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:19.796 A:middle
And the display may refresh at

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:22.646 A:middle
16.6 millisecond or 60 frames

00:07:22.646 --> 00:07:23.226 A:middle
per second.

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:24.726 A:middle
Same as the video we've just

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:25.026 A:middle
seen.

00:07:25.536 --> 00:07:26.976 A:middle
These will create some visual

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:27.896 A:middle
inconsistencies.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.166 A:middle
So how did we get there?

00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:34.146 A:middle
What have we done to be in this

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:35.126 A:middle
situation?

00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:38.716 A:middle
Well, we didn't do much really,

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:39.746 A:middle
and that's kind of the whole

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:40.506 A:middle
point of this.

00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:43.786 A:middle
After rendering the frame, we

00:07:43.786 --> 00:07:45.046 A:middle
requested the next drawable from

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:46.006 A:middle
the display link.

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:47.126 A:middle
And as soon as we got the

00:07:47.126 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
drawable, we finished the final

00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:50.506 A:middle
pass and presented it right

00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:50.876 A:middle
away.

00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:54.216 A:middle
We explicitly told the system to

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:55.876 A:middle
present that drawable as soon as

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.656 A:middle
possible, at the next refresh

00:07:57.656 --> 00:07:58.096 A:middle
interval.

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.376 A:middle
After all, we are targeting 60
