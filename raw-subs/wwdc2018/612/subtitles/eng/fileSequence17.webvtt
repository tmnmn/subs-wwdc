00:16:57.376 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
By-- by looking at it at a

00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:01.926 A:middle
glance, we can already tell that

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.626 A:middle
the GPU does not seem to be

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:04.346 A:middle
doing much.

00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:07.316 A:middle
It's idle during this time, so

00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:08.776 A:middle
this means that we are not

00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:09.306 A:middle
fitting it.

00:17:10.215 --> 00:17:13.665 A:middle
Now we can look at the CPU, of

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.606 A:middle
course, and they seem to be

00:17:15.606 --> 00:17:17.096 A:middle
fairly busy down here.

00:17:17.806 --> 00:17:18.016 A:middle
Right?

00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:19.996 A:middle
They are really-- all of it

00:17:20.056 --> 00:17:20.846 A:middle
seems quite solid.

00:17:22.195 --> 00:17:24.665 A:middle
But notice what you see here is

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:26.746 A:middle
the time profiler view of our

00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:28.086 A:middle
application.

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:29.906 A:middle
And it does not seem to be

00:17:29.906 --> 00:17:30.326 A:middle
running.

00:17:31.356 --> 00:17:34.066 A:middle
Why is our game not running and

00:17:34.196 --> 00:17:35.686 A:middle
how come that causes a stutter?

00:17:35.686 --> 00:17:36.046 A:middle
Why?

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.856 A:middle
Well, we can switch to the new

00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:41.386 A:middle
view I talked to you about, the

00:17:41.386 --> 00:17:42.556 A:middle
new thread states view.

00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:45.806 A:middle
To do so you will go into the

00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:48.056 A:middle
icon of your application and

00:17:48.056 --> 00:17:50.876 A:middle
click on that button here and

00:17:50.876 --> 00:17:51.866 A:middle
that would pull out the track

00:17:51.936 --> 00:17:52.426 A:middle
display.

00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:54.976 A:middle
And in this case, you can switch

00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:55.776 A:middle
to thread states.

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:59.296 A:middle
And that will hope-- hopefully

00:17:59.296 --> 00:18:00.566 A:middle
already help you to see there is
