00:31:58.156 --> 00:32:00.216 A:middle
long frame, and work it all up--

00:32:00.216 --> 00:32:01.206 A:middle
all the way up from there.

00:32:01.706 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:32:03.156 --> 00:32:04.236 A:middle
The tool will give you all the

00:32:04.236 --> 00:32:06.266 A:middle
information you need to identify

00:32:06.266 --> 00:32:06.826 A:middle
the problems.

00:32:07.716 --> 00:32:10.276 A:middle
But you will need to use the

00:32:10.676 --> 00:32:11.006 A:middle
tool.

00:32:11.516 --> 00:32:14.026 A:middle
And that is really the takeaway.

00:32:14.626 --> 00:32:15.786 A:middle
So we have seen a bunch of

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:18.016 A:middle
common pitfalls followed by some

00:32:18.016 --> 00:32:18.856 A:middle
best practices.

00:32:19.906 --> 00:32:22.146 A:middle
All of these issues can be found

00:32:22.146 --> 00:32:22.966 A:middle
through profiling.

00:32:23.286 --> 00:32:24.266 A:middle
That's how we found them.

00:32:24.456 --> 00:32:25.696 A:middle
We analyzed a ton of games,

00:32:26.156 --> 00:32:27.426 A:middle
found the common issues, and

00:32:27.426 --> 00:32:28.876 A:middle
decided to put a talk together.

00:32:30.026 --> 00:32:31.926 A:middle
Now, if you have access to the

00:32:31.926 --> 00:32:34.126 A:middle
engine source code, make sure

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:35.496 A:middle
that both thread pacing and

00:32:35.496 --> 00:32:36.736 A:middle
thread priorities are well

00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:37.336 A:middle
configured.

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.326 A:middle
It's just a couple lines of code

00:32:39.356 --> 00:32:39.646 A:middle
really.

00:32:40.796 --> 00:32:42.866 A:middle
But regardless, your game should

00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:45.236 A:middle
always adapt to thermals and do

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:47.516 A:middle
not submit unnecessary GPU work.

00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:49.996 A:middle
By making sure to follow all

00:32:49.996 --> 00:32:52.436 A:middle
these best practices, you too

00:32:52.436 --> 00:32:53.796 A:middle
will be developing technically

00:32:53.796 --> 00:32:54.426 A:middle
awesome games.

00:32:54.856 --> 00:32:55.886 A:middle
And that's what this is all

00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:56.186 A:middle
about.

00:32:57.396 --> 00:32:59.506 A:middle
For more information, there is

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:01.526 A:middle
a-- a coming lab at 12 PM.
