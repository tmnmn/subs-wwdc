00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.916 A:middle
And after doing so, you may be

00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:03.636 A:middle
thinking well, what about

00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:04.986 A:middle
maximum duration?

00:14:05.726 --> 00:14:07.596 A:middle
What about the concept of

00:14:07.686 --> 00:14:08.726 A:middle
priority of our work?

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:10.216 A:middle
Or how long a thing could take?

00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:13.076 A:middle
Well, that's actually the next

00:14:13.076 --> 00:14:14.246 A:middle
issue on our list-- thread

00:14:14.316 --> 00:14:14.906 A:middle
priorities.

00:14:15.426 --> 00:14:17.806 A:middle
Let's visualize it first, same

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:18.886 A:middle
as we did before.

00:14:19.646 --> 00:14:20.986 A:middle
Again, with the modified version

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:22.016 A:middle
of the Fox II demo.

00:14:22.616 --> 00:14:24.676 A:middle
You may be thinking and you

00:14:24.676 --> 00:14:25.526 A:middle
would be right that there are

00:14:25.526 --> 00:14:26.756 A:middle
many things that could cause

00:14:26.756 --> 00:14:27.826 A:middle
stuttering such as this.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.276 A:middle
Maybe you are doing some

00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:30.306 A:middle
resource loading or [inaudible]

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:31.396 A:middle
compilation.

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:33.886 A:middle
Today we will focus on the more

00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:36.266 A:middle
fundamental but also incredibly

00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:37.416 A:middle
common type of stutter.

00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:40.436 A:middle
That caused by thread stalling.

00:14:41.036 --> 00:14:44.766 A:middle
If the work priority is not well

00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:47.346 A:middle
communicated to the system, your

00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:49.056 A:middle
game may have unexpected stalls.

00:14:50.216 --> 00:14:52.776 A:middle
iOS does plenty of stuff besides

00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:53.576 A:middle
rendering your game.

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:56.616 A:middle
Thread priorities are used to

00:14:56.616 --> 00:14:58.476 A:middle
warranty the quality of service

00:14:58.476 --> 00:14:59.586 A:middle
in the whole system.
