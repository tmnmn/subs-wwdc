00:42:59.266 --> 00:43:01.356 A:middle
works-- you can try to pull off

00:43:01.356 --> 00:43:02.286 A:middle
an attack against your own

00:43:02.286 --> 00:43:03.486 A:middle
content, make sure that, yeah,

00:43:03.626 --> 00:43:05.006 A:middle
my content security policy is

00:43:05.006 --> 00:43:06.846 A:middle
defending me, good, and of

00:43:06.846 --> 00:43:07.736 A:middle
course test that the

00:43:07.736 --> 00:43:08.946 A:middle
functionality that should be

00:43:08.946 --> 00:43:09.706 A:middle
there is there.

00:43:11.826 --> 00:43:12.526 A:middle
We have a blog.

00:43:12.786 --> 00:43:14.286 A:middle
The WebKit project is an open

00:43:14.286 --> 00:43:15.016 A:middle
source project.

00:43:15.276 --> 00:43:16.576 A:middle
We have a blog where we talk

00:43:16.576 --> 00:43:17.856 A:middle
about these technologies and

00:43:17.856 --> 00:43:18.596 A:middle
other things.

00:43:18.966 --> 00:43:20.536 A:middle
This is where we'll update you

00:43:20.536 --> 00:43:22.056 A:middle
on those two last response

00:43:22.056 --> 00:43:22.446 A:middle
headers.

00:43:22.786 --> 00:43:24.626 A:middle
The cross-origin resource policy

00:43:24.626 --> 00:43:25.796 A:middle
and the cross-origin window

00:43:25.826 --> 00:43:26.296 A:middle
policy.

00:43:26.656 --> 00:43:28.156 A:middle
Because we're still discussing

00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:29.276 A:middle
those with the other browser

00:43:29.276 --> 00:43:30.786 A:middle
vendors, trying to make sure

00:43:30.786 --> 00:43:32.106 A:middle
that they're standard so that

00:43:32.436 --> 00:43:34.316 A:middle
the same response headers work

00:43:34.316 --> 00:43:35.756 A:middle
across all the browsers.

00:43:36.296 --> 00:43:37.896 A:middle
And so there might be slight

00:43:37.896 --> 00:43:40.656 A:middle
name changes or added attributes

00:43:40.656 --> 00:43:42.076 A:middle
that we still don't have here.

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.736 A:middle
Also, it's so brand new that you

00:43:44.736 --> 00:43:46.016 A:middle
actually won't have access to

00:43:46.016 --> 00:43:48.166 A:middle
this until seed two or the

00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:48.936 A:middle
public seed.

00:43:49.476 --> 00:43:51.326 A:middle
We don't have full support for

00:43:51.326 --> 00:43:53.336 A:middle
these in the developer seed yet.

00:43:55.486 --> 00:43:56.496 A:middle
Quick shout out to these other

00:43:56.496 --> 00:43:56.946 A:middle
sessions.

00:43:57.096 --> 00:43:58.456 A:middle
Please come see us, including

00:43:58.456 --> 00:44:00.266 A:middle
me, at the Safari, WebKit, and
