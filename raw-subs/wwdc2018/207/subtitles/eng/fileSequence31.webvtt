00:30:58.056 --> 00:31:00.876 A:middle
It turns out that cache effects

00:31:01.056 --> 00:31:02.496 A:middle
that are a result of the

00:31:02.496 --> 00:31:04.936 A:middle
speculative execution can be

00:31:04.936 --> 00:31:07.756 A:middle
monitored by malicious code and

00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:10.036 A:middle
then they can leak that data

00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:11.996 A:middle
read that was never supposed to

00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:12.416 A:middle
happen.

00:31:13.026 --> 00:31:14.606 A:middle
It was out of bounds, that load

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.456 A:middle
should have not happened, but it

00:31:16.456 --> 00:31:18.996 A:middle
effects caches and by measuring

00:31:18.996 --> 00:31:21.116 A:middle
caches the-- an attacker can

00:31:21.116 --> 00:31:22.826 A:middle
leak that data that was not

00:31:22.826 --> 00:31:23.866 A:middle
supposed to be loaded.

00:31:25.086 --> 00:31:26.806 A:middle
OK. How does this map to web

00:31:26.876 --> 00:31:27.396 A:middle
content?

00:31:28.046 --> 00:31:29.986 A:middle
Remember the same-origin policy?

00:31:30.476 --> 00:31:31.636 A:middle
This thing that has been

00:31:31.636 --> 00:31:34.476 A:middle
protecting us for 20 years that

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.676 A:middle
makes sure that the main frame

00:31:36.676 --> 00:31:37.996 A:middle
from one origin cannot reach

00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:39.756 A:middle
into and read the bytes of some

00:31:39.756 --> 00:31:41.496 A:middle
other frame, maybe your embedded

00:31:41.496 --> 00:31:41.916 A:middle
content.

00:31:43.206 --> 00:31:44.496 A:middle
With speculative execution

00:31:44.496 --> 00:31:46.416 A:middle
attacks, we can no longer rely

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:47.656 A:middle
on the same-origin policy.

00:31:48.766 --> 00:31:50.196 A:middle
There is now an ability-- if you

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:51.576 A:middle
can run scripts and you're in

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.696 A:middle
the same process, the same web

00:31:53.696 --> 00:31:55.676 A:middle
content process as some other

00:31:55.676 --> 00:31:57.916 A:middle
content, you can read that

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.336 A:middle
content through speculative

00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:00.276 A:middle
execution attacks.
