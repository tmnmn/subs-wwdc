&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.566 A:middle
My name is John Wilander.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.216 A:middle
I am an engineer on the Safari

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.056 A:middle
and WebKit team and I'm here to

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:37.006 A:middle
present to you today how to

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:38.356 A:middle
secure web content.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:42.076 A:middle
Or, as I like to call it, take

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:43.236 A:middle
the Swede's advice.

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:46.476 A:middle
So, you might be asking

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.796 A:middle
yourself, web content, that's a

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:49.956 A:middle
pretty broad term.

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.686 A:middle
Is this session really for me?

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.846 A:middle
Yes, it is for you.

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:57.176 A:middle
To start off, apps use tons of

00:00:57.176 --> 00:00:57.826 A:middle
web content.
