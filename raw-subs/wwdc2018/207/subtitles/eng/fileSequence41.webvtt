00:40:59.706 --> 00:41:01.636 A:middle
UIWebView to WKWebview.

00:41:02.046 --> 00:41:03.076 A:middle
These are the basics.

00:41:03.786 --> 00:41:05.216 A:middle
Then we have the defense

00:41:05.216 --> 00:41:06.586 A:middle
mechanisms we've been going

00:41:06.586 --> 00:41:07.006 A:middle
through.

00:41:07.386 --> 00:41:09.386 A:middle
Content security policy will

00:41:09.386 --> 00:41:11.956 A:middle
help you here with cross-site

00:41:11.956 --> 00:41:13.236 A:middle
scripting and speculative

00:41:13.236 --> 00:41:14.276 A:middle
execution attacks.

00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:17.686 A:middle
HttpOnly cookies will provide

00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:19.706 A:middle
you with some kind of protection

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:20.826 A:middle
against cross-site scripting,

00:41:20.906 --> 00:41:22.526 A:middle
meaning the scripts can't steal

00:41:22.526 --> 00:41:24.306 A:middle
the cookies, but it will

00:41:24.306 --> 00:41:26.026 A:middle
definitely help you against

00:41:26.026 --> 00:41:27.586 A:middle
speculative execution attacks

00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:29.616 A:middle
because HttpOnly cookies are

00:41:29.756 --> 00:41:31.236 A:middle
kept in the network process.

00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:34.446 A:middle
Subresource integrity.

00:41:34.876 --> 00:41:36.036 A:middle
This is the way you fight

00:41:36.436 --> 00:41:37.896 A:middle
against a compromised CDN.

00:41:38.306 --> 00:41:40.246 A:middle
Someone's executing code on your

00:41:40.246 --> 00:41:42.106 A:middle
page that you never wanted to be

00:41:42.106 --> 00:41:42.346 A:middle
there.

00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:47.176 A:middle
SameSite cookies, this is a way

00:41:47.176 --> 00:41:49.766 A:middle
to fight forged requests done

00:41:49.816 --> 00:41:51.936 A:middle
invisibly by some phishing page

00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:52.816 A:middle
to your server.

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:54.456 A:middle
You will know that because the

00:41:54.456 --> 00:41:56.036 A:middle
SameSite cookie won't be sent

00:41:56.036 --> 00:41:57.496 A:middle
when you're embedded and so you

00:41:57.496 --> 00:41:59.336 A:middle
don't accept the request.
