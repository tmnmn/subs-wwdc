00:20:56.936 --> 00:21:00.016 A:middle
someone else, it looks to you as

00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:01.606 A:middle
if, whoa, the user just went to

00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:03.326 A:middle
my site, I got my SameSite

00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:04.936 A:middle
cookie, everything looks fine,

00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:07.676 A:middle
but the opener maintains a

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:10.226 A:middle
handle and kind of owns your

00:21:10.226 --> 00:21:13.176 A:middle
window and has certain APIs to

00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:15.356 A:middle
control that window that the

00:21:15.356 --> 00:21:16.996 A:middle
opener can even navigate your

00:21:16.996 --> 00:21:18.736 A:middle
window outside of your control.

00:21:20.036 --> 00:21:22.346 A:middle
And with the new response header

00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:24.356 A:middle
cross-origin window policy, you

00:21:24.356 --> 00:21:27.076 A:middle
finally get to say no to this.

00:21:27.576 --> 00:21:30.326 A:middle
Most sites are not in the

00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:32.136 A:middle
practice of using this API and

00:21:32.136 --> 00:21:33.446 A:middle
this kind of communication where

00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:35.076 A:middle
the opener owns the window.

00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:36.766 A:middle
Like, it's a very rare thing to

00:21:36.766 --> 00:21:38.926 A:middle
see on the web, but it's there

00:21:38.926 --> 00:21:39.986 A:middle
and it works that way by

00:21:39.986 --> 00:21:40.426 A:middle
default.

00:21:40.886 --> 00:21:42.496 A:middle
By sending this header, in this

00:21:42.496 --> 00:21:44.966 A:middle
case deny, you're saying that

00:21:44.966 --> 00:21:47.076 A:middle
handle should not be there.

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.436 A:middle
It's OK to open me, but you

00:21:49.436 --> 00:21:50.736 A:middle
don't get to control me from

00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:51.186 A:middle
that point.

00:21:51.986 --> 00:21:54.166 A:middle
There is also a way added in

00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:55.466 A:middle
this-- I'm not showing it here--

00:21:55.466 --> 00:21:57.066 A:middle
but you can say allow post

00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:57.616 A:middle
message.

00:21:58.016 --> 00:21:59.036 A:middle
You might want to be able to

00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:00.826 A:middle
talk between these two windows
