00:38:59.116 --> 00:39:01.716 A:middle
being loaded by evil.example and

00:39:01.716 --> 00:39:02.906 A:middle
we'll do that block in the

00:39:02.906 --> 00:39:03.866 A:middle
network process.

00:39:04.186 --> 00:39:06.336 A:middle
Again, giving you that process

00:39:06.336 --> 00:39:08.406 A:middle
separation so that a speculative

00:39:08.406 --> 00:39:09.946 A:middle
execution attack cannot read

00:39:09.946 --> 00:39:10.676 A:middle
your bytes.

00:39:12.686 --> 00:39:14.976 A:middle
OK. We have the final attack

00:39:14.976 --> 00:39:16.366 A:middle
category to have a look at and

00:39:16.366 --> 00:39:17.466 A:middle
this is a pretty brief one.

00:39:17.836 --> 00:39:19.246 A:middle
Window control attacks.

00:39:20.216 --> 00:39:21.906 A:middle
So, we're going to look

00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:23.626 A:middle
malicious window navigation,

00:39:23.786 --> 00:39:24.896 A:middle
sometimes referred to as

00:39:24.936 --> 00:39:26.466 A:middle
tabnapping, and then the

00:39:26.466 --> 00:39:26.806 A:middle
defense.

00:39:28.446 --> 00:39:29.466 A:middle
Again, we're back here at

00:39:29.466 --> 00:39:31.486 A:middle
evil.example and instead of

00:39:31.486 --> 00:39:33.506 A:middle
embedding your content, thus the

00:39:33.506 --> 00:39:36.106 A:middle
window.open opens your content

00:39:36.106 --> 00:39:37.876 A:middle
in a new window and you don't

00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:38.416 A:middle
get to know.

00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:39.986 A:middle
You don't get to decide, yeah,

00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:41.876 A:middle
OK, someone opened my web page.

00:39:42.066 --> 00:39:44.136 A:middle
And the SameSite cookie may be

00:39:44.136 --> 00:39:44.826 A:middle
sent here.

00:39:44.826 --> 00:39:46.086 A:middle
You might think everything's

00:39:46.086 --> 00:39:49.376 A:middle
good, but evil.example could

00:39:49.376 --> 00:39:52.416 A:middle
wait until your user loses focus

00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:54.856 A:middle
of that page of yours and then

00:39:54.856 --> 00:39:57.786 A:middle
use the handle to navigate it to

00:39:57.786 --> 00:40:00.516 A:middle
a fraud page that looks like
