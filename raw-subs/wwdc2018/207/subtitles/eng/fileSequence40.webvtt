00:39:57.786 --> 00:40:00.516 A:middle
a fraud page that looks like

00:40:00.516 --> 00:40:02.646 A:middle
your page and asks the user to

00:40:02.646 --> 00:40:04.736 A:middle
please log in again, of course

00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:05.906 A:middle
stealing the credentials and

00:40:05.906 --> 00:40:07.036 A:middle
sending them off to the

00:40:07.036 --> 00:40:07.496 A:middle
attacker.

00:40:08.436 --> 00:40:09.416 A:middle
This is one of the things that

00:40:09.416 --> 00:40:10.756 A:middle
can happen if you leave the

00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.126 A:middle
control up to the opener.

00:40:13.206 --> 00:40:14.286 A:middle
Instead, you deploy the

00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:16.836 A:middle
cross-origin window policy, you

00:40:16.836 --> 00:40:19.466 A:middle
deny this thing, and there will

00:40:19.466 --> 00:40:21.556 A:middle
be no handler for the attacker

00:40:21.556 --> 00:40:23.846 A:middle
page to navigate your window

00:40:23.846 --> 00:40:24.126 A:middle
with.

00:40:24.666 --> 00:40:27.386 A:middle
So, that's the final defense in

00:40:27.386 --> 00:40:27.756 A:middle
attack.

00:40:28.496 --> 00:40:31.046 A:middle
It's time to take action.

00:40:31.366 --> 00:40:32.656 A:middle
We're going to review what we've

00:40:32.656 --> 00:40:34.516 A:middle
been looking at here, just so

00:40:34.516 --> 00:40:35.656 A:middle
that you know what you need to

00:40:35.656 --> 00:40:37.956 A:middle
go back to your office or your

00:40:37.956 --> 00:40:39.456 A:middle
home and start working on.

00:40:40.196 --> 00:40:42.926 A:middle
First, we have to secure these

00:40:42.926 --> 00:40:43.746 A:middle
transports.

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:45.916 A:middle
Move to HTTPS and WSS.

00:40:47.206 --> 00:40:49.126 A:middle
You should have secure cookies.

00:40:49.546 --> 00:40:51.056 A:middle
You should also mark them

00:40:51.056 --> 00:40:51.916 A:middle
HttpOnly.

00:40:52.296 --> 00:40:53.966 A:middle
If you take the Swede's advice,

00:40:54.246 --> 00:40:55.486 A:middle
just make all of your cookies

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:56.716 A:middle
HttpOnly and secure.

00:40:57.806 --> 00:40:59.706 A:middle
And you need to migrate off of

00:40:59.706 --> 00:41:01.636 A:middle
UIWebView to WKWebview.
