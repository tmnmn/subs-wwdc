00:15:58.426 --> 00:16:00.476 A:middle
really are magic in that we use

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:01.666 A:middle
them for so many things.

00:16:02.286 --> 00:16:03.746 A:middle
And perhaps the most sensitive

00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:05.636 A:middle
thing is they authenticate

00:16:05.636 --> 00:16:06.126 A:middle
users.

00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:08.196 A:middle
Once you have logged in with

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:09.266 A:middle
your credentials, you get a

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:11.296 A:middle
cookie that holds your session

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:13.806 A:middle
and that cookie, if it's moved

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.476 A:middle
or its stolen and moved to

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:17.366 A:middle
another browser engine in many

00:16:17.366 --> 00:16:19.446 A:middle
cases can impersonate that user.

00:16:19.886 --> 00:16:21.096 A:middle
So, you really need to protect

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:21.636 A:middle
your cookies.

00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:23.686 A:middle
As I already mentioned, you

00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:25.376 A:middle
should mark them all secure so

00:16:25.376 --> 00:16:26.796 A:middle
that they never leak in plain

00:16:26.796 --> 00:16:27.706 A:middle
text requests.

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:29.396 A:middle
But there are more things to do,

00:16:29.396 --> 00:16:29.636 A:middle
right?

00:16:30.576 --> 00:16:33.776 A:middle
So, looking at Http Only

00:16:33.776 --> 00:16:34.436 A:middle
cookies.

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:36.736 A:middle
This is fairly old technology.

00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:38.936 A:middle
I would guess this has been

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:40.466 A:middle
around for at least 15 years,

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.496 A:middle
the ability to say HTTP only.

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:45.376 A:middle
You might be familiar with the

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:47.236 A:middle
web API document.cookie.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.146 A:middle
This is a way for JavaScript to

00:16:50.496 --> 00:16:51.826 A:middle
read and write cookies.

00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:55.206 A:middle
JavaScript is powerful.

00:16:55.336 --> 00:16:56.606 A:middle
And, as I mentioned, if you load

00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:57.976 A:middle
JavaScript from other servers,

00:16:58.026 --> 00:16:59.896 A:middle
they have access to all of your

00:16:59.896 --> 00:17:01.886 A:middle
user's cookies through this API.
