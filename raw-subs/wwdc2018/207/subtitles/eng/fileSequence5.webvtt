00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.686 A:middle
If there for some reason is a

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:03.696 A:middle
plain text request for my server

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.776 A:middle
or to my server, don't send the

00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:06.066 A:middle
cookie.

00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:08.336 A:middle
And, since you should be using

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:10.186 A:middle
secure transports, all of your

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:11.606 A:middle
cookies should be marked secure.

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:14.846 A:middle
Final-- finally on your to-do

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:16.316 A:middle
list here for secure transports

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:17.886 A:middle
is specific for apps.

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:19.566 A:middle
You might have heard about app

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:21.246 A:middle
transport security or ATS.

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:24.266 A:middle
It is the default behavior for

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:26.116 A:middle
iOS apps, meaning that they

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:27.996 A:middle
should be using only secure

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:29.436 A:middle
transports for network traffic.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.156 A:middle
Now, there is an opt out you can

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:33.836 A:middle
have in your info p list to say,

00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:35.606 A:middle
hey, you know, for web content,

00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:37.276 A:middle
I'd still like to do insecure

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:37.956 A:middle
requests.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:39.536 A:middle
Don't do that.

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:42.276 A:middle
You should be saying no in this

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:44.096 A:middle
info p list and specifically for

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:45.926 A:middle
arbitrary web content loads.

00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:48.396 A:middle
OK. Now we've secured the

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:49.066 A:middle
transport.

00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:50.136 A:middle
Let's move on.

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:51.226 A:middle
We're now going to look at

00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:52.786 A:middle
cross-origin lockdown.

00:05:53.716 --> 00:05:54.756 A:middle
The reason why I call it

00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:57.106 A:middle
lockdown is this is really you

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:00.276 A:middle
opting into saner, safer, more
