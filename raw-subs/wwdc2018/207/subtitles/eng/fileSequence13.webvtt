00:12:59.716 --> 00:13:00.636 A:middle
And, as you see, I made a

00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:01.206 A:middle
comment there.

00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:02.016 A:middle
No inline.

00:13:02.136 --> 00:13:03.876 A:middle
That is also part of the default

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:04.526 A:middle
behavior.

00:13:04.776 --> 00:13:06.086 A:middle
Once you set it this way, you're

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.496 A:middle
also saying no inline scripting.

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:10.726 A:middle
Only load scripts from files.

00:13:11.276 --> 00:13:12.606 A:middle
That's why I keep thinking of it

00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:14.116 A:middle
as an architecture policy

00:13:14.366 --> 00:13:15.976 A:middle
because you're separating logic

00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:17.786 A:middle
into files, separating from

00:13:17.786 --> 00:13:21.246 A:middle
markup, and separating from

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:23.516 A:middle
styling, which are also in

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:23.946 A:middle
files.

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:25.046 A:middle
CSS files.

00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:29.636 A:middle
OK. Now, you wanted to load that

00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:31.686 A:middle
script from cdn.example and if

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.176 A:middle
you just go with a default

00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:35.186 A:middle
source self, then that's going

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:35.976 A:middle
to be locked down.

00:13:35.976 --> 00:13:37.116 A:middle
Right? You can't do remote

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:37.776 A:middle
script loading.

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:39.776 A:middle
Well, there's a whitelisting

00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:41.036 A:middle
mechanism in the content

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:41.856 A:middle
security policy.

00:13:42.396 --> 00:13:44.356 A:middle
You just say script source, hey,

00:13:44.566 --> 00:13:47.256 A:middle
let's open up for cdn.example

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:48.566 A:middle
because I actually want to load

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:49.246 A:middle
script from there.

00:13:49.786 --> 00:13:51.066 A:middle
Now you can load from your own

00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:53.716 A:middle
server and cdn.example, but

00:13:53.716 --> 00:13:54.466 A:middle
nowhere else.

00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:57.206 A:middle
Well, you might want to have

00:13:57.206 --> 00:14:00.326 A:middle
that social media plugin, little
