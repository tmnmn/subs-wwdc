00:16:59.896 --> 00:17:01.886 A:middle
user's cookies through this API.

00:17:03.316 --> 00:17:05.106 A:middle
You should not be offering them

00:17:05.106 --> 00:17:06.136 A:middle
that much power.

00:17:06.246 --> 00:17:07.496 A:middle
Instead, you should protect your

00:17:07.496 --> 00:17:08.816 A:middle
cookies, especially your

00:17:08.816 --> 00:17:10.746 A:middle
authentication cookies that are

00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:12.736 A:middle
effectively a way to log in as a

00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:15.636 A:middle
user by marking them Http Only.

00:17:16.455 --> 00:17:18.526 A:middle
This means that-- this cookie--

00:17:18.526 --> 00:17:19.796 A:middle
and this is the set cookie

00:17:19.796 --> 00:17:21.036 A:middle
header you are seeing here where

00:17:21.036 --> 00:17:23.236 A:middle
we are sending HTTP only, which

00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:25.256 A:middle
means don't expose this cookie

00:17:25.506 --> 00:17:26.986 A:middle
in the document.cookie API.

00:17:27.836 --> 00:17:30.136 A:middle
So, JavaScript can now not see

00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:31.876 A:middle
this cookie and of course not

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:33.486 A:middle
fiddle with it, steal it, or

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:34.316 A:middle
manipulate it.

00:17:34.936 --> 00:17:36.126 A:middle
So, this is something you should

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
be doing.

00:17:38.186 --> 00:17:40.376 A:middle
We also have another thing, new

00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:42.086 A:middle
technology as of the betas,

00:17:42.416 --> 00:17:43.766 A:middle
SameSite cookies.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.916 A:middle
Again, you are setting this on

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:47.486 A:middle
the set cookie header that you--

00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:49.096 A:middle
when you're setting the cookie

00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:49.696 A:middle
in the browser.

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:52.216 A:middle
See here I've got the same site

00:17:52.216 --> 00:17:54.076 A:middle
attribute equals strict.

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:56.356 A:middle
There's also a lax version of

00:17:56.356 --> 00:17:58.596 A:middle
this, but what this is basically

00:17:58.596 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
saying is this particular
