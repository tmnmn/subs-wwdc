It may be used for ads, login

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.636 A:middle
flows, splash screens.

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.325 A:middle
You might be using Safari View

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.876 A:middle
Controller to-- for parts of

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:06.236 A:middle
your app.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.146 A:middle
You might have whole parts of

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:10.246 A:middle
your UI rendered in a web view.

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:12.756 A:middle
You might also have companion

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:14.306 A:middle
web apps that are supposed to be

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:16.456 A:middle
rendered in a web browser and

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:18.276 A:middle
that are sharing content or

00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:20.806 A:middle
providing a joint experience

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:22.226 A:middle
across apps and web apps.

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:24.506 A:middle
So, really, yes, the session is

00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:24.876 A:middle
for you.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:26.986 A:middle
And security is important.

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:28.936 A:middle
You want to stay in business?

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:30.096 A:middle
You want to provide the best

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:31.026 A:middle
customer experience.

00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:32.536 A:middle
You want to be ahead of your

00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:33.346 A:middle
competition.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.476 A:middle
You want to get this right so

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:37.176 A:middle
that when they don't they are

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:38.746 A:middle
the ones to fall, you stay in

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:39.086 A:middle
the market.

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:41.806 A:middle
OK. What are we going to cover

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:42.086 A:middle
today?

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:44.986 A:middle
We're going to have a look at

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.506 A:middle
first securing your transports.

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.786 A:middle
This is just a brief mentioning

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:51.936 A:middle
from me about basics that we

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:53.536 A:middle
need to do before we do the

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:53.876 A:middle
rest.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:55.136 A:middle
If you don't secure your

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:56.786 A:middle
transports, most other bets are

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:57.036 A:middle
off.

00:01:57.926 --> 00:01:59.106 A:middle
Then we'll go into a look at

00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:00.646 A:middle
cross-origin lockdown.
