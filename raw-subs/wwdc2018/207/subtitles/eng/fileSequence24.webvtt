00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:01.136 A:middle
In this case, trying to steal

00:24:01.136 --> 00:24:02.326 A:middle
the cookies of that user.

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.376 A:middle
But remember, the scripts are

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:05.726 A:middle
running with full power.

00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:07.586 A:middle
They can take over your whole

00:24:07.716 --> 00:24:09.536 A:middle
UI, make requests on your-- on

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:10.916 A:middle
the victim user's behalf.

00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:13.366 A:middle
Cross-site scripting, which this

00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:15.116 A:middle
is an example of, is a bad

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:15.506 A:middle
thing.

00:24:15.506 --> 00:24:16.646 A:middle
You don't want it to happen to

00:24:16.646 --> 00:24:16.836 A:middle
you.

00:24:17.846 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
Luckily, you have marked your

00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:21.856 A:middle
authentication cookies Http

00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:22.616 A:middle
Only, right?

00:24:22.976 --> 00:24:25.626 A:middle
So, ha, they're not available to

00:24:25.626 --> 00:24:26.546 A:middle
that malicious script.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.306 A:middle
Now, Http Only cookies don't

00:24:29.306 --> 00:24:30.796 A:middle
protect you against cross-site

00:24:30.796 --> 00:24:31.256 A:middle
scripting.

00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:32.626 A:middle
That script is still running.

00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:35.886 A:middle
Http Only cookies protect your

00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:36.226 A:middle
cookies.

00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:38.216 A:middle
So, you need to do something

00:24:38.216 --> 00:24:39.926 A:middle
more and what did you do?

00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:41.926 A:middle
Content security policy.

00:24:42.656 --> 00:24:44.626 A:middle
You started out with default

00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:45.696 A:middle
source self, right?

00:24:46.036 --> 00:24:48.566 A:middle
Saying, eh, only I get to run

00:24:48.566 --> 00:24:49.986 A:middle
script on my page please.

00:24:50.716 --> 00:24:52.726 A:middle
And that means by default no

00:24:52.726 --> 00:24:55.416 A:middle
inline scripting and that whole

00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:57.466 A:middle
class of bugs just goes away.

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:00.966 A:middle
Now there is no way to inject
