same web content process and

00:34:00.796 --> 00:34:02.516 A:middle
doing the speculation thing to

00:34:02.516 --> 00:34:04.386 A:middle
try to read things that the

00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:06.246 A:middle
attacker wasn't supposed to be

00:34:06.246 --> 00:34:07.136 A:middle
able to read.

00:34:07.136 --> 00:34:08.496 A:middle
Well, if you have separated

00:34:08.496 --> 00:34:09.956 A:middle
things into different processes,

00:34:10.696 --> 00:34:12.036 A:middle
this attack doesn't work, right?

00:34:12.636 --> 00:34:13.956 A:middle
You cannot do speculative

00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:16.196 A:middle
execution attacks across process

00:34:16.196 --> 00:34:18.286 A:middle
boundaries, so this is already a

00:34:18.286 --> 00:34:20.626 A:middle
defense here and of course

00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:22.686 A:middle
that's super important that the

00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.886 A:middle
web content process cannot reach

00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.666 A:middle
into the network process and do

00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:28.096 A:middle
speculative execution attacks

00:34:28.096 --> 00:34:28.396 A:middle
there.

00:34:30.056 --> 00:34:32.076 A:middle
But if you are still using

00:34:32.076 --> 00:34:34.396 A:middle
UIWebView, which, by the way, we

00:34:34.396 --> 00:34:36.196 A:middle
are deprecating as of the betas,

00:34:37.306 --> 00:34:39.275 A:middle
you're not in a very good place.

00:34:40.485 --> 00:34:42.436 A:middle
Now, if you have evil.example

00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:44.686 A:middle
and you have your web content

00:34:45.315 --> 00:34:46.686 A:middle
and you've got the network stack

00:34:47.496 --> 00:34:48.826 A:middle
and then you put this all in

00:34:48.826 --> 00:34:51.946 A:middle
your app, from the view of a

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:53.596 A:middle
speculative execution attack,

00:34:54.315 --> 00:34:55.505 A:middle
this all blends together.

00:34:56.306 --> 00:34:58.346 A:middle
It's all the same process space.

00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:00.666 A:middle
There are no guards for
