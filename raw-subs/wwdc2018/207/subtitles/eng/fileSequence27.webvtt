00:26:59.156 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
So, we're back at the messaging

00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:04.106 A:middle
app and you have this forum

00:27:04.106 --> 00:27:05.586 A:middle
where the user is supposed to be

00:27:05.586 --> 00:27:06.596 A:middle
able to send messages.

00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:08.446 A:middle
And, frankly, when it comes down

00:27:08.446 --> 00:27:09.916 A:middle
to it, it's going to be HTTP

00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:10.476 A:middle
requests.

00:27:10.746 --> 00:27:12.956 A:middle
Probably in HTTP post when that

00:27:12.956 --> 00:27:14.236 A:middle
message comes into the server

00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:15.276 A:middle
and look at the cookies,

00:27:15.276 --> 00:27:16.946 A:middle
everything looks good, and then

00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:18.766 A:middle
you'll send that message off to

00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:19.776 A:middle
its recipient, right?

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:21.956 A:middle
Well, now comes along the

00:27:21.956 --> 00:27:24.536 A:middle
malicious attacker that of

00:27:24.586 --> 00:27:26.756 A:middle
course has phished one of your

00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:29.866 A:middle
users, meaning sent a link and

00:27:29.866 --> 00:27:31.726 A:middle
lured that user onto the

00:27:31.726 --> 00:27:33.876 A:middle
attacker's site, evil.example,

00:27:34.526 --> 00:27:36.466 A:middle
and is showing some really,

00:27:36.466 --> 00:27:38.006 A:middle
really fascinating stats on

00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:38.586 A:middle
cats.

00:27:39.336 --> 00:27:41.176 A:middle
That makes the victim stay

00:27:41.176 --> 00:27:42.336 A:middle
around for a little while at

00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:42.566 A:middle
least.

00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:43.676 A:middle
I mean you've got to check these

00:27:43.676 --> 00:27:44.326 A:middle
stats out.

00:27:45.286 --> 00:27:47.176 A:middle
What the victim user doesn't

00:27:47.176 --> 00:27:49.326 A:middle
realize is that there's a hidden

00:27:49.486 --> 00:27:51.966 A:middle
resource load with your web

00:27:51.966 --> 00:27:55.156 A:middle
content sending a message on the

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:57.576 A:middle
victim user's behalf-- which of

00:27:57.636 --> 00:27:59.226 A:middle
course automatically adds the

00:27:59.226 --> 00:28:01.036 A:middle
cookies, that's just how the web
