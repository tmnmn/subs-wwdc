00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:01.636 A:middle
And, as a third example,

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:02.536 A:middle
iframes.

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:05.506 A:middle
You can embed full pages from

00:07:05.506 --> 00:07:06.416 A:middle
other servers.

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:08.246 A:middle
Cross-origin, meaning from a

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:09.436 A:middle
different domain name.

00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:11.146 A:middle
These are three examples of

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:12.826 A:middle
cross-origin loads.

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:15.616 A:middle
Now, we've had a security

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:18.046 A:middle
mechanisms-- security mechanism

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:20.096 A:middle
on the web for over 20 years

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:21.606 A:middle
that has provided basic

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:22.526 A:middle
protection for these

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:24.496 A:middle
cross-origin loads and it's

00:07:24.496 --> 00:07:26.356 A:middle
called the same-origin policy.

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.586 A:middle
And it differentiates-- here

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:30.196 A:middle
you've got these examples with

00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:31.206 A:middle
real domain names.

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:33.956 A:middle
So, you've got the example for

00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:37.096 A:middle
loading the image, you've got a

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:39.336 A:middle
CDN where you loaded the script,

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.226 A:middle
and you may have a social

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:42.926 A:middle
widget, an iframe, coming from

00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:44.166 A:middle
social.example here.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.856 A:middle
And, just to mention, when I say

00:07:46.856 --> 00:07:49.076 A:middle
.example it's just me being sure

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:50.176 A:middle
that I'm not talking about real

00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:51.026 A:middle
websites here.

00:07:51.406 --> 00:07:52.666 A:middle
If it's easier for you, you can

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:54.396 A:middle
think of it as .com or .org.

00:07:55.566 --> 00:07:56.446 A:middle
Anyway, these are the

00:07:56.446 --> 00:07:58.306 A:middle
cross-origin loads and the

00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:01.236 A:middle
same-origin policy keeps track
