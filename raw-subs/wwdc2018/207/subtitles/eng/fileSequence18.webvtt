00:17:58.596 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
saying is this particular

00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:02.976 A:middle
cookie, only send it when I am

00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:04.446 A:middle
the page owner, when I am the

00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:06.436 A:middle
main page, not when I'm

00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:06.946 A:middle
embedded.

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:08.946 A:middle
When I own the whole user

00:18:08.946 --> 00:18:10.906 A:middle
experience, I have the whole web

00:18:10.906 --> 00:18:12.816 A:middle
view, then send this cookie.

00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:16.606 A:middle
So, in the embedded case, if

00:18:16.606 --> 00:18:18.016 A:middle
your web content is being

00:18:18.016 --> 00:18:19.386 A:middle
embedded by someone you don't

00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:21.726 A:middle
trust, the SameSite cookie will

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.266 A:middle
not be sent and your server can

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:24.946 A:middle
detect this.

00:18:25.036 --> 00:18:27.516 A:middle
Aha! I didn't get that SameSite

00:18:27.516 --> 00:18:29.576 A:middle
cookie, so either this user is

00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:31.086 A:middle
not logged in or I'm being

00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:32.796 A:middle
embedded and I'm not going to

00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:34.866 A:middle
allow this thing to happen were

00:18:34.866 --> 00:18:36.356 A:middle
that, for instance, a sensitive

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:36.966 A:middle
transaction.

00:18:37.886 --> 00:18:40.376 A:middle
So, that's getting in control of

00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:41.076 A:middle
being embedded.

00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:42.826 A:middle
SameSite cookies.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:46.336 A:middle
OK. Cross-origin lockdown.

00:18:46.436 --> 00:18:47.206 A:middle
We're now going to look at

00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:49.446 A:middle
really brand new technology.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.706 A:middle
WebKit is first implementing

00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:53.726 A:middle
these two new response headers

00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:55.736 A:middle
and they're all about

00:18:55.736 --> 00:18:57.376 A:middle
restricting who gets to load

00:18:57.376 --> 00:18:58.296 A:middle
your resources.

00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:00.686 A:middle
Cross-origin resource policy.
