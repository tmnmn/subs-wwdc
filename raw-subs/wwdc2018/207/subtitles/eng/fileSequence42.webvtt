00:42:00.236 --> 00:42:01.376 A:middle
It also happens against

00:42:01.426 --> 00:42:02.946 A:middle
speculative execution attacks

00:42:03.236 --> 00:42:04.976 A:middle
because if an evil page is

00:42:04.976 --> 00:42:06.606 A:middle
trying to pull in your resources

00:42:06.606 --> 00:42:08.476 A:middle
to be able to leverage an attack

00:42:08.476 --> 00:42:10.616 A:middle
against them, again, SameSite

00:42:10.616 --> 00:42:11.976 A:middle
cookies won't be sent and you

00:42:11.976 --> 00:42:12.916 A:middle
can deny the load.

00:42:13.486 --> 00:42:15.506 A:middle
Then we get into these new

00:42:15.506 --> 00:42:17.206 A:middle
technologies, the cross-origin

00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:18.216 A:middle
resource policy.

00:42:18.786 --> 00:42:20.996 A:middle
This is the way you can say that

00:42:20.996 --> 00:42:23.366 A:middle
images, scripts, and other

00:42:23.366 --> 00:42:25.556 A:middle
cross-origin loads, deny them, I

00:42:25.556 --> 00:42:27.366 A:middle
only want to load this on my

00:42:27.366 --> 00:42:27.996 A:middle
page.

00:42:28.506 --> 00:42:29.786 A:middle
And, finally, controlling

00:42:29.786 --> 00:42:32.306 A:middle
windows is making sure that that

00:42:32.306 --> 00:42:34.686 A:middle
handle goes away if someone else

00:42:34.686 --> 00:42:36.556 A:middle
opens your web content in their

00:42:36.556 --> 00:42:37.136 A:middle
own window.

00:42:40.286 --> 00:42:41.786 A:middle
These are fairly easy to adopt,

00:42:42.246 --> 00:42:44.266 A:middle
especially for you.

00:42:44.386 --> 00:42:45.826 A:middle
You know your sites, you know

00:42:45.826 --> 00:42:47.106 A:middle
your web content, you know your

00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.176 A:middle
apps, you know how they're

00:42:48.176 --> 00:42:49.096 A:middle
supposed to work.

00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:50.586 A:middle
If we would just turn this on by

00:42:50.586 --> 00:42:51.906 A:middle
default for all of you, it would

00:42:51.906 --> 00:42:53.796 A:middle
probably break a few things, so

00:42:53.796 --> 00:42:56.246 A:middle
you need to opt into this.

00:42:56.326 --> 00:42:58.076 A:middle
And by opting in means you

00:42:58.076 --> 00:42:59.266 A:middle
should check that the security

00:42:59.266 --> 00:43:01.356 A:middle
works-- you can try to pull off
