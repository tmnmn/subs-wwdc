00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:00.276 A:middle
opting into saner, safer, more

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.346 A:middle
secure defaults for your web

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:02.906 A:middle
content.

00:06:03.286 --> 00:06:05.186 A:middle
We're locking it down to more or

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:06.306 A:middle
less what it should have been

00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:08.446 A:middle
all along and then you open up

00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:10.096 A:middle
the specific things you want to

00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:10.946 A:middle
do.

00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:13.836 A:middle
So, let's move in and look at

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.376 A:middle
what are cross-origin loads

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:15.846 A:middle
anyway.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:17.336 A:middle
What are we going to lock down?

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:20.106 A:middle
Well, web technologies have this

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:21.956 A:middle
powerful feature where you can

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:24.036 A:middle
weave together content from

00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:25.676 A:middle
different servers and different

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:26.266 A:middle
origins.

00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:28.586 A:middle
Different domain names, if you

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.036 A:middle
so will.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.136 A:middle
An example of this is images.

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:34.356 A:middle
You can load images from any

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:36.746 A:middle
server on the web into your web

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:37.586 A:middle
content and that's a

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:38.696 A:middle
cross-origin load.

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:41.166 A:middle
You can also load scripts from

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.066 A:middle
other servers.

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:44.696 A:middle
Interestingly, those scripts

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.556 A:middle
actually execute with the same

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.746 A:middle
powers and privileges as your

00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:50.636 A:middle
own scripts, so you need to be

00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:52.246 A:middle
really careful what scripts you

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:53.926 A:middle
load off of other servers.

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:56.426 A:middle
They more or less own your web

00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:56.996 A:middle
content.

00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:58.406 A:middle
They are executing with the same

00:06:58.406 --> 00:06:59.136 A:middle
powers as you.
