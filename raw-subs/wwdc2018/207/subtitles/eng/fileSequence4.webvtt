00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.756 A:middle
And this is also a thing you can

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:02.486 A:middle
tell the rendering engine for

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:03.796 A:middle
how long it should remember

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:04.106 A:middle
this.

00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:05.916 A:middle
So, typically at least half a

00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:06.956 A:middle
year ahead in time.

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:09.846 A:middle
Now, you might also be loading

00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:11.546 A:middle
content off of other servers,

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:12.966 A:middle
servers that are not under your

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:14.536 A:middle
control, not your domain name.

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:16.916 A:middle
There's also a header you can

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:18.685 A:middle
send to the browser engine

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:19.896 A:middle
called upgrade insecure

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:23.036 A:middle
requests, also an HTTP response

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:25.076 A:middle
header, which tells the browser,

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.256 A:middle
hey, go ahead and upgrade all

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:28.796 A:middle
those other links to content

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:31.086 A:middle
too, even if it's not from my

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:33.126 A:middle
server and even if they have not

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:35.406 A:middle
set strict transport security.

00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:38.476 A:middle
So, those two things that will

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.106 A:middle
automatically upgrade to secure

00:04:40.106 --> 00:04:40.836 A:middle
transports.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.516 A:middle
Another thing you need to do is

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.206 A:middle
make sure that you mark your

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:46.646 A:middle
cookies secure.

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:48.346 A:middle
This is an attribute you add in

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:49.486 A:middle
your set cookie header,

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:51.606 A:middle
semi-colon secure.

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:54.376 A:middle
This means that you're telling

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:56.666 A:middle
the network stack this cookie

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.716 A:middle
should only ever be sent over a

00:04:58.716 --> 00:04:59.716 A:middle
secure transport.
