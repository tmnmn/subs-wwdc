WS, the plain text equivalents,

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:02.916 A:middle
still exist is not an excuse to

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:03.796 A:middle
keep using them.

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:05.686 A:middle
You need to move to secure

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.866 A:middle
transports because that's what's

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:09.936 A:middle
going to ensure that the content

00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:11.396 A:middle
that you are rendering in a

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:13.686 A:middle
browser or in your app comes

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:15.606 A:middle
from the server you expect it to

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:17.776 A:middle
come from and no one has fiddled

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:19.036 A:middle
around with the content in

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:19.696 A:middle
transport.

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:22.876 A:middle
So, moving to HTTPS for your

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:23.576 A:middle
main content.

00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:24.626 A:middle
There are a couple of

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:26.156 A:middle
technologies that can help you

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:26.636 A:middle
get there.

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:28.756 A:middle
First on your to-do list--

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.116 A:middle
except for just moving to HTTPS

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:33.526 A:middle
in general-- is strict transport

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:35.236 A:middle
security or HSTS.

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:39.076 A:middle
This is an HTTP response header

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:40.636 A:middle
you can send to the rendering

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:43.136 A:middle
engine, such as WebKit, and tell

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:45.666 A:middle
it, hey, my domain should always

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.296 A:middle
be loaded over HTTPS.

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:50.636 A:middle
If there's ever an HTTP request

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:52.436 A:middle
from me, just automatically

00:03:52.436 --> 00:03:54.306 A:middle
upgrade it for me to HTTPS.

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:56.066 A:middle
Never making plain text

00:03:56.206 --> 00:03:57.486 A:middle
connections to my server,

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:57.996 A:middle
please.

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.756 A:middle
And this is also a thing you can
