Content security policy, you

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:03.966 A:middle
start out default source self.

00:15:04.296 --> 00:15:05.506 A:middle
Lock everything down.

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:06.616 A:middle
Everything that's going to be

00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:08.476 A:middle
loaded with a source attribute,

00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:10.586 A:middle
like loaded from a server, needs

00:15:10.586 --> 00:15:12.646 A:middle
to be from my origin, my domain.

00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:14.666 A:middle
Then you open up.

00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:17.346 A:middle
For script, you add what domain

00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:19.716 A:middle
names do I allow scripts from.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:23.366 A:middle
You say where do I allow myself

00:15:23.366 --> 00:15:24.746 A:middle
to load frames from.

00:15:25.436 --> 00:15:26.496 A:middle
You whitelist them.

00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:28.526 A:middle
And, finally, if you're ever

00:15:28.526 --> 00:15:30.156 A:middle
going to be in an iframe

00:15:30.156 --> 00:15:32.026 A:middle
yourself under someone else's

00:15:32.026 --> 00:15:33.996 A:middle
page, you put them in that white

00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:35.726 A:middle
list for frame ancestors.

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:38.446 A:middle
OK. That's the content security

00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:38.986 A:middle
policy.

00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:42.256 A:middle
It has more knobs to turn and

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:44.276 A:middle
we'll also see in a couple of

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.346 A:middle
the attack scenarios a few

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:47.646 A:middle
flavors of these things.

00:15:48.986 --> 00:15:49.476 A:middle
Moving on.

00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:50.786 A:middle
We're going to have a look at

00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:51.476 A:middle
cookies.

00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:53.616 A:middle
Cookies are-- they actually were

00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:56.456 A:middle
called magic cookies in the

00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:58.426 A:middle
beginning of the web, and they

00:15:58.426 --> 00:16:00.476 A:middle
really are magic in that we use
