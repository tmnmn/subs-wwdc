00:27:59.226 --> 00:28:01.036 A:middle
cookies, that's just how the web

00:28:01.036 --> 00:28:01.556 A:middle
works, right?

00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:02.796 A:middle
If a request goes out on the

00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:04.866 A:middle
wire, cookies are added, and to

00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:07.086 A:middle
your servers this looks like I

00:28:07.086 --> 00:28:08.416 A:middle
guess this user wants to send

00:28:08.466 --> 00:28:09.216 A:middle
this message.

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:11.916 A:middle
That could be spam, that could

00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:13.816 A:middle
be sending links for malicious

00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:14.796 A:middle
software.

00:28:15.206 --> 00:28:16.626 A:middle
It could be breaking up with a

00:28:16.626 --> 00:28:18.986 A:middle
partner-- ah, OK, they won't go

00:28:18.986 --> 00:28:20.526 A:middle
that far, but malicious

00:28:20.526 --> 00:28:21.606 A:middle
software, we'll stay there.

00:28:22.296 --> 00:28:25.176 A:middle
So, you don't want this to

00:28:25.176 --> 00:28:25.726 A:middle
happen.

00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:30.086 A:middle
Luckily, you have used same-site

00:28:30.146 --> 00:28:30.726 A:middle
cookies.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.006 A:middle
They will not be sent in the

00:28:33.006 --> 00:28:34.996 A:middle
embedded case, which means that

00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:37.756 A:middle
your server will detect I'm

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:39.516 A:middle
being embedded here.

00:28:39.826 --> 00:28:42.016 A:middle
I don't allow the user to send

00:28:42.016 --> 00:28:44.246 A:middle
messages from an iframe under

00:28:44.246 --> 00:28:45.256 A:middle
some other page.

00:28:45.626 --> 00:28:47.656 A:middle
I need to own the UI when I do

00:28:47.656 --> 00:28:49.276 A:middle
this sensitive thing, such as

00:28:49.276 --> 00:28:51.146 A:middle
sending messages, I'm just going

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.146 A:middle
to deny this request.

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:54.096 A:middle
This, again, puts you in

00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:54.496 A:middle
control.

00:28:56.316 --> 00:28:58.326 A:middle
OK. We have now covered

00:28:58.326 --> 00:28:59.956 A:middle
cross-origin attacks and looked

00:28:59.956 --> 00:29:01.446 A:middle
at how some of those security
