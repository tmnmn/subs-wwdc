00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:00.686 A:middle
Cross-origin resource policy.

00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:03.366 A:middle
We've already mentioned these

00:19:03.426 --> 00:19:05.446 A:middle
two types of content that are

00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:06.506 A:middle
allowed to be loaded

00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:08.496 A:middle
cross-origin, images, and

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:09.016 A:middle
scripts.

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:11.006 A:middle
And they've been around since

00:19:11.076 --> 00:19:13.006 A:middle
the origins of the web and

00:19:13.006 --> 00:19:14.206 A:middle
therefore there has never really

00:19:14.206 --> 00:19:17.046 A:middle
been a mechanism to say, hey, I

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.586 A:middle
actually don't want any other

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:20.796 A:middle
sites to load my scripts or load

00:19:20.796 --> 00:19:21.506 A:middle
my images.

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:24.206 A:middle
Could I just only load them

00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:24.966 A:middle
myself please?

00:19:25.806 --> 00:19:27.106 A:middle
No, we've had this thing on the

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:28.936 A:middle
web where anyone can load images

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:30.166 A:middle
and scripts from any server.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:33.146 A:middle
And now we're providing you with

00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:35.206 A:middle
a control to tell the browser,

00:19:35.206 --> 00:19:36.326 A:middle
hey, I don't want that.

00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:38.376 A:middle
And it's called the cross-origin

00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:39.276 A:middle
resource policy.

00:19:39.966 --> 00:19:41.576 A:middle
In this particular example here,

00:19:41.626 --> 00:19:43.006 A:middle
I'm giving it the directive

00:19:43.236 --> 00:19:46.446 A:middle
same, meaning only my own site

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:47.646 A:middle
can load this.

00:19:47.646 --> 00:19:49.856 A:middle
Only when my domain name is the

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:52.446 A:middle
main page domain and I'm pulling

00:19:52.446 --> 00:19:54.386 A:middle
in this image, then load the

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:55.726 A:middle
image into the web content

00:19:55.726 --> 00:19:56.136 A:middle
process.

00:19:56.426 --> 00:19:57.616 A:middle
Same thing for script here.

00:19:58.106 --> 00:19:59.776 A:middle
So, when someone else comes

00:19:59.776 --> 00:20:01.666 A:middle
along and tries to cross-origin
