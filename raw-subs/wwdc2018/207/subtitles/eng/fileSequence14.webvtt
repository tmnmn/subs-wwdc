00:13:57.206 --> 00:14:00.326 A:middle
that social media plugin, little

00:14:00.326 --> 00:14:02.006 A:middle
widget in there in an iframe,

00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:04.306 A:middle
well, you can add a frame source

00:14:04.306 --> 00:14:05.956 A:middle
directive saying I want to be

00:14:05.956 --> 00:14:07.366 A:middle
able to load iframes from

00:14:07.366 --> 00:14:10.036 A:middle
social.example, but no one else

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:11.436 A:middle
gets to have an iframe on my

00:14:11.646 --> 00:14:12.076 A:middle
page.

00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:13.656 A:middle
Again, you're in control of

00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:13.946 A:middle
that.

00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:16.346 A:middle
And there's even a directive for

00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:18.376 A:middle
the reverse case when your

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:19.946 A:middle
content is being loaded in an

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:21.856 A:middle
iframe on someone else's page.

00:14:22.316 --> 00:14:24.766 A:middle
In this example, news.example is

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:26.476 A:middle
loading your content in an

00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:27.066 A:middle
iframe.

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:29.556 A:middle
You can send out the directive--

00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:30.576 A:middle
the last directive here in

00:14:30.576 --> 00:14:32.656 A:middle
content security policy frame

00:14:32.696 --> 00:14:33.626 A:middle
ancestors.

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:35.516 A:middle
This is telling the browser,

00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:38.686 A:middle
hey, check whosever framing me

00:14:38.926 --> 00:14:40.666 A:middle
and all the way up to the top

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:42.726 A:middle
page and they all have to be on

00:14:42.726 --> 00:14:44.666 A:middle
my list of what I allow.

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:46.806 A:middle
So, in this case, your web

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:48.926 A:middle
content has said news.example, I

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:50.346 A:middle
have a business deal with them,

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:51.816 A:middle
they're allowed to have my

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:52.926 A:middle
content in an iframe.

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.916 A:middle
OK. That's quite a lot, so let's

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:58.026 A:middle
just review this line by line

00:14:58.026 --> 00:14:59.556 A:middle
quickly so we know what it's

00:14:59.556 --> 00:14:59.936 A:middle
saying.
