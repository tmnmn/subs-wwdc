00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:01.576 A:middle
Cross-site scripting.

00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:02.906 A:middle
Imagine you have built a

00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:03.876 A:middle
messaging app.

00:23:04.306 --> 00:23:06.346 A:middle
You have it as a native app with

00:23:06.346 --> 00:23:08.066 A:middle
a web view for rich formatting,

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:09.706 A:middle
for instance, and you may have a

00:23:09.706 --> 00:23:11.646 A:middle
companion web app that one can

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:13.346 A:middle
go or your users can go to in a

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:15.216 A:middle
regular web browser, and you can

00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:16.906 A:middle
send messages to each other and

00:23:16.906 --> 00:23:18.676 A:middle
maybe with very rich formatting.

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:20.756 A:middle
Most of your users are, of

00:23:20.756 --> 00:23:21.956 A:middle
course, nice.

00:23:22.176 --> 00:23:23.676 A:middle
Nice people sending each other

00:23:23.676 --> 00:23:24.476 A:middle
nice messages.

00:23:24.926 --> 00:23:26.256 A:middle
Some of them are angry sending

00:23:26.256 --> 00:23:28.206 A:middle
angry messages, but every now

00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:29.996 A:middle
and then comes along a malicious

00:23:29.996 --> 00:23:32.166 A:middle
user who might send a message

00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:33.076 A:middle
looking like this.

00:23:34.106 --> 00:23:36.066 A:middle
It starts out nice, hello, but

00:23:36.286 --> 00:23:37.586 A:middle
then it contains markup.

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:40.476 A:middle
Now, if you have made a mistake

00:23:40.476 --> 00:23:42.226 A:middle
somewhere in the chain, in the

00:23:42.226 --> 00:23:43.936 A:middle
native apps web view or on the

00:23:43.936 --> 00:23:46.626 A:middle
website, where this will

00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:48.336 A:middle
actually be interpreted as real

00:23:48.336 --> 00:23:50.076 A:middle
markup instead of a message,

00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:52.766 A:middle
suddenly the attacker, the

00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:54.436 A:middle
malicious user here, is able to

00:23:54.556 --> 00:23:57.976 A:middle
run scripts in the recipient's

00:23:58.266 --> 00:23:59.036 A:middle
browser engine.

00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:01.136 A:middle
In this case, trying to steal
