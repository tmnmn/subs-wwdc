00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:00.806 A:middle
policy, but it's not good

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:01.176 A:middle
enough.

00:09:01.546 --> 00:09:03.506 A:middle
So, you need to opt in to some

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:04.726 A:middle
more defaults.

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:07.016 A:middle
Starting out with subresource

00:09:07.016 --> 00:09:08.716 A:middle
integrity-- I'll go through them

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:09.956 A:middle
and I'll mention them here.

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.256 A:middle
This is just a simple change in

00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:14.006 A:middle
the markup for your script tags.

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:16.426 A:middle
The second part is content

00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:17.376 A:middle
security policy.

00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:19.056 A:middle
This is providing a full-on

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:20.576 A:middle
security policy for your whole

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:22.366 A:middle
page where you can say, hey, I

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.596 A:middle
only want to load scripts from

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:24.236 A:middle
over here.

00:09:24.546 --> 00:09:25.976 A:middle
I don't want to have any frames

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:27.596 A:middle
from other servers, and so on.

00:09:27.696 --> 00:09:28.326 A:middle
We'll look at that.

00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:30.686 A:middle
And the third category here are

00:09:30.686 --> 00:09:32.496 A:middle
simple server configurations.

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:35.076 A:middle
These are HTTP response headers

00:09:35.136 --> 00:09:36.666 A:middle
that you send out telling the

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:38.856 A:middle
browser engine, hey, I want more

00:09:38.856 --> 00:09:40.466 A:middle
secure defaults, I don't want

00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:42.366 A:middle
these old legacy APIs that

00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:43.496 A:middle
you've been supporting because I

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:44.206 A:middle
don't need them.

00:09:44.426 --> 00:09:45.176 A:middle
Please help me here.

00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:47.926 A:middle
So, let's dive into it and look

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.566 A:middle
at subresource integrity.

00:09:50.696 --> 00:09:52.746 A:middle
Now, this is a perfectly

00:09:52.746 --> 00:09:54.416 A:middle
plausible way of loading that

00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:55.906 A:middle
framework from the CDN, your

00:09:56.366 --> 00:09:57.826 A:middle
content delivery network.

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:01.916 A:middle
And that script tag is going to
