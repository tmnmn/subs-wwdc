00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:00.826 A:middle
talk between these two windows

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.466 A:middle
without giving the opener

00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:04.566 A:middle
control of your window and then

00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:06.156 A:middle
you can say allow post message.

00:22:07.206 --> 00:22:08.896 A:middle
OK. That's also new technology

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:10.126 A:middle
and now we've gone through the

00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:11.416 A:middle
cross-origin lockdown.

00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:15.516 A:middle
As you can see, that's not too

00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:15.946 A:middle
hard.

00:22:15.946 --> 00:22:18.326 A:middle
It's a set of response headers.

00:22:18.326 --> 00:22:19.836 A:middle
It's the content security policy

00:22:19.836 --> 00:22:22.096 A:middle
where you whitelist things, and

00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:24.066 A:middle
it's the integrity attribute for

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:26.126 A:middle
script tags that's more or less

00:22:26.126 --> 00:22:27.116 A:middle
what we're talking about here.

00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:28.926 A:middle
I'll give you some motivation.

00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:29.926 A:middle
We're going to look at some

00:22:29.926 --> 00:22:30.976 A:middle
attack scenarios.

00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:32.806 A:middle
What are you defending against

00:22:32.806 --> 00:22:34.666 A:middle
and how to these security

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:36.696 A:middle
technologies fit in with these

00:22:36.696 --> 00:22:37.256 A:middle
attacks?

00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:38.286 A:middle
We're going to look at

00:22:38.286 --> 00:22:39.406 A:middle
cross-origin attacks,

00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:41.396 A:middle
speculative execution attacks--

00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:43.586 A:middle
some people may have heard about

00:22:43.586 --> 00:22:45.046 A:middle
Spectre-- and we're going to

00:22:45.046 --> 00:22:46.596 A:middle
look at window control attacks.

00:22:47.136 --> 00:22:48.756 A:middle
Let's dive into the cross-origin

00:22:48.756 --> 00:22:49.086 A:middle
ones.

00:22:50.066 --> 00:22:51.046 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:22:51.046 --> 00:22:52.596 A:middle
cross-site scripting, when

00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:53.566 A:middle
something goes bad with your

00:22:53.666 --> 00:22:53.936 A:middle
CDN.

00:22:53.936 --> 00:22:55.586 A:middle
And that one you kind of could

00:22:55.696 --> 00:22:56.756 A:middle
tell that I was going for,

00:22:56.756 --> 00:22:56.986 A:middle
right?

00:22:57.486 --> 00:22:58.576 A:middle
And cross-site request

00:22:58.576 --> 00:22:59.146 A:middle
forgeries.
