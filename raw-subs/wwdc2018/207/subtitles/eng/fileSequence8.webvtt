00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:01.236 A:middle
same-origin policy keeps track

00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:02.836 A:middle
of where did I load this image

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:04.096 A:middle
from or where did I load this

00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:05.586 A:middle
script from, where did I load

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.446 A:middle
this iframe from, so that it can

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.756 A:middle
provide basic protection.

00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:12.046 A:middle
That basic protection means that

00:08:12.046 --> 00:08:14.366 A:middle
your page in this example cannot

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:16.426 A:middle
reach into that iframe from

00:08:16.426 --> 00:08:19.266 A:middle
social.example and read its

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.126 A:middle
bytes, read its contents, or

00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:22.416 A:middle
write to its contents.

00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:24.106 A:middle
The same-origin policy is

00:08:24.106 --> 00:08:25.826 A:middle
guarding, saying this part of

00:08:25.826 --> 00:08:27.066 A:middle
the page actually came from a

00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:28.626 A:middle
different server, you're not

00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:29.866 A:middle
allowed to just go straight in

00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:31.996 A:middle
there and change things or read

00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:33.366 A:middle
what the user happened to enter

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:34.905 A:middle
into that form, for instance.

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:37.596 A:middle
An easier way to think of the

00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:38.905 A:middle
same-origin policy is just

00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:41.166 A:middle
matching two pages, two tabs in

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:41.696 A:middle
a browser.

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:43.596 A:middle
One tab shouldn't be able to

00:08:43.596 --> 00:08:45.546 A:middle
just go into another tab and see

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:46.656 A:middle
what the user's doing over

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:47.056 A:middle
there.

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:49.176 A:middle
It's the same-origin policy

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:51.886 A:middle
effectively doing its job there

00:08:53.426 --> 00:08:53.500 A:middle
too.

00:08:54.726 --> 00:08:55.756 A:middle
So, the lockdown.

00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:57.306 A:middle
How do we lock this down

00:08:57.306 --> 00:08:57.806 A:middle
properly?

00:08:58.116 --> 00:08:59.116 A:middle
We've got the same-origin

00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:00.806 A:middle
policy, but it's not good
