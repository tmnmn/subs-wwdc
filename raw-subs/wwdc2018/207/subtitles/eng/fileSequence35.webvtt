00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:00.666 A:middle
There are no guards for

00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:02.896 A:middle
speculative execution attack in

00:35:02.896 --> 00:35:03.506 A:middle
this scenario.

00:35:04.286 --> 00:35:05.846 A:middle
You need to get off of

00:35:05.846 --> 00:35:06.666 A:middle
UIWebView.

00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:10.376 A:middle
If you move to WKWebView, you'll

00:35:10.376 --> 00:35:12.696 A:middle
instead get this.

00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:15.096 A:middle
Out of process, separated,

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:16.856 A:middle
badness happening in the

00:35:16.856 --> 00:35:18.676 A:middle
evil.example content process

00:35:18.796 --> 00:35:19.856 A:middle
cannot affect the rest.

00:35:21.266 --> 00:35:23.306 A:middle
OK. We've moved to WKWebView.

00:35:23.656 --> 00:35:24.726 A:middle
Let's look at how content

00:35:24.726 --> 00:35:26.996 A:middle
security policy can help you.

00:35:27.406 --> 00:35:28.626 A:middle
You might have an embedded

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:29.976 A:middle
social widget from

00:35:29.976 --> 00:35:33.166 A:middle
social.example, but then you

00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:34.696 A:middle
might have an injection attack,

00:35:34.696 --> 00:35:36.086 A:middle
maybe it's the messaging thing

00:35:36.086 --> 00:35:37.376 A:middle
again where someone can send

00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.716 A:middle
markup in a message and you

00:35:38.946 --> 00:35:40.546 A:middle
accidentally render it and they

00:35:40.546 --> 00:35:41.606 A:middle
pull in an iframe from

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:42.516 A:middle
evil.example.

00:35:43.376 --> 00:35:45.816 A:middle
Well, you may also have an ad

00:35:45.816 --> 00:35:47.426 A:middle
there that you want to have

00:35:47.426 --> 00:35:48.676 A:middle
there and then the ad network

00:35:48.676 --> 00:35:50.286 A:middle
gets compromised and redirects

00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:51.626 A:middle
to evil.example and then pulls

00:35:51.626 --> 00:35:52.246 A:middle
in an iframe.

00:35:52.646 --> 00:35:53.996 A:middle
And, remember, you never want to

00:35:53.996 --> 00:35:55.426 A:middle
be in a web content process

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.946 A:middle
together with a frame from

00:35:57.946 --> 00:35:58.876 A:middle
evil.example.

00:35:59.986 --> 00:36:00.866 A:middle
So, what have you done?
