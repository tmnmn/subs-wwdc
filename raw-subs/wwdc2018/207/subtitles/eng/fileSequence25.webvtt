00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:00.966 A:middle
Now there is no way to inject

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:03.006 A:middle
script into your web pages and

00:25:03.006 --> 00:25:04.796 A:middle
make them execute because you

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:06.326 A:middle
set the policy for the page.

00:25:08.326 --> 00:25:10.946 A:middle
OK. What could happen if your

00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:12.096 A:middle
CDN gets compromised?

00:25:12.526 --> 00:25:14.186 A:middle
This is bad and let's just hope

00:25:14.186 --> 00:25:15.986 A:middle
it doesn't happen, but it can

00:25:16.796 --> 00:25:17.266 A:middle
happen.

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.216 A:middle
So, you're loading the framework

00:25:19.216 --> 00:25:22.486 A:middle
off of that CDN and you really

00:25:22.486 --> 00:25:24.056 A:middle
rely on this because it's

00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:25.406 A:middle
executing with the same powers

00:25:25.406 --> 00:25:26.516 A:middle
as your own scripts.

00:25:28.136 --> 00:25:30.016 A:middle
Now, what if they've been

00:25:30.016 --> 00:25:31.656 A:middle
compromised and are redirecting

00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:33.416 A:middle
that script request to

00:25:33.456 --> 00:25:35.286 A:middle
evil.example, loading attack

00:25:35.366 --> 00:25:35.666 A:middle
code.

00:25:36.526 --> 00:25:38.126 A:middle
Now suddenly you thought you got

00:25:38.126 --> 00:25:40.146 A:middle
a framework-- maybe they were

00:25:40.146 --> 00:25:41.406 A:middle
nice enough to bundle in the

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:42.846 A:middle
framework, but they're also

00:25:42.846 --> 00:25:44.156 A:middle
doing some nasty things.

00:25:44.866 --> 00:25:46.836 A:middle
So, what did you do?

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.426 A:middle
Well, you whitelisted script

00:25:49.426 --> 00:25:50.966 A:middle
source in your content security

00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:53.626 A:middle
policy, so the browser will just

00:25:53.626 --> 00:25:55.396 A:middle
refuse to execute any code

00:25:55.396 --> 00:25:56.736 A:middle
coming from evil.example.

00:25:58.246 --> 00:26:01.026 A:middle
OK. Oh, now the attacker needs
