00:28:59.956 --> 00:29:01.446 A:middle
at how some of those security

00:29:01.446 --> 00:29:02.636 A:middle
mechanisms help us.

00:29:03.026 --> 00:29:04.046 A:middle
We're going to move on to

00:29:04.046 --> 00:29:06.166 A:middle
something that's really exotic

00:29:06.386 --> 00:29:08.846 A:middle
and new; Spectre attacks or

00:29:08.846 --> 00:29:10.956 A:middle
speculative execution attacks.

00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:16.776 A:middle
What I'm going to cover here is

00:29:16.946 --> 00:29:18.476 A:middle
what speculative execution is,

00:29:19.186 --> 00:29:20.846 A:middle
how it can be turned into an

00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:22.336 A:middle
attack, and then we'll look at

00:29:22.336 --> 00:29:24.636 A:middle
how to defend against it.

00:29:25.316 --> 00:29:27.486 A:middle
So, now we're deep down in a

00:29:27.676 --> 00:29:28.436 A:middle
CPU.

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:31.246 A:middle
It's executing code.

00:29:31.646 --> 00:29:33.726 A:middle
It has reached a conditional.

00:29:34.276 --> 00:29:35.786 A:middle
It's going to do something

00:29:35.786 --> 00:29:36.476 A:middle
conditionally.

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.756 A:middle
It's asking itself, hey, I've

00:29:38.756 --> 00:29:40.856 A:middle
got an array index here, x.

00:29:41.326 --> 00:29:42.806 A:middle
Is this index OK?

00:29:43.226 --> 00:29:45.096 A:middle
Is this in bounds or out of

00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:46.516 A:middle
bounds for my array read?

00:29:47.416 --> 00:29:50.046 A:middle
Because if it's out of bounds, I

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:51.516 A:middle
should do some error handling

00:29:51.516 --> 00:29:53.446 A:middle
here, but if it's in bound I

00:29:53.446 --> 00:29:54.906 A:middle
should go ahead and load that

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:55.756 A:middle
data in the array.

00:29:57.036 --> 00:30:00.326 A:middle
Now, modern CPUs learn over time
