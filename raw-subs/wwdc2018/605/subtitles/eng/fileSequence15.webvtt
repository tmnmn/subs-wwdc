00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:01.096 A:middle
same place in the real world.

00:15:01.396 --> 00:15:05.446 A:middle
So, a quick word about privacy

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:06.196 A:middle
with WorldMaps.

00:15:06.826 --> 00:15:07.916 A:middle
In the process of recording the

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:09.926 A:middle
WorldMap, we take into account

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.226 A:middle
features of the world around

00:15:11.226 --> 00:15:12.386 A:middle
you, physical arrangements of

00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:13.616 A:middle
objects and so forth.

00:15:15.016 --> 00:15:16.746 A:middle
While it does include geographic

00:15:16.746 --> 00:15:18.036 A:middle
information like latitude and

00:15:18.036 --> 00:15:19.366 A:middle
longitude and thus your

00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:20.756 A:middle
application doesn't need to ask

00:15:20.756 --> 00:15:22.296 A:middle
for location permission to use

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:25.046 A:middle
ARKit, it may include personally

00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:26.726 A:middle
identifiable information about

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:27.736 A:middle
the user's environment.

00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:29.976 A:middle
So, we recommend that you treat

00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:32.086 A:middle
a serialized WorldMap the same

00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:33.266 A:middle
way that you would any other

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.866 A:middle
user-created private data.

00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:38.686 A:middle
This means that you want to make

00:15:38.686 --> 00:15:39.846 A:middle
sure that you're encrypting it

00:15:40.616 --> 00:15:41.976 A:middle
both at rest and when moving

00:15:41.976 --> 00:15:42.746 A:middle
across the network.

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:44.676 A:middle
You may also want to let your

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:46.406 A:middle
users know if you're planning to

00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:48.156 A:middle
save that WorldMap information

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.586 A:middle
for an extended period of time,

00:15:49.896 --> 00:15:51.316 A:middle
past a single session of your

00:15:51.316 --> 00:15:51.856 A:middle
application.

00:15:53.296 --> 00:15:54.766 A:middle
In SwiftShot, we're able to take

00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:56.806 A:middle
advantage of iOS's built-in

00:15:56.986 --> 00:15:59.596 A:middle
encryption for encrypting the

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.606 A:middle
data while at rest.
