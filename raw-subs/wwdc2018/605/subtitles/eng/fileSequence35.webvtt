00:34:58.966 --> 00:35:00.556 A:middle
built-in physics body types such

00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.556 A:middle
as cube, sphere, cylinder.

00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:04.796 A:middle
And if you use those, you really

00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:05.946 A:middle
get the best performance.

00:35:06.676 --> 00:35:08.136 A:middle
If you don't specify one,

00:35:08.576 --> 00:35:09.966 A:middle
SceneKit will build a convex

00:35:09.966 --> 00:35:11.826 A:middle
hull automatically for you and

00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:12.516 A:middle
that works.

00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:14.366 A:middle
But it is a lower, can be a

00:35:14.366 --> 00:35:16.796 A:middle
lower performance implementation

00:35:17.276 --> 00:35:19.376 A:middle
by adding these objects where

00:35:19.376 --> 00:35:20.306 A:middle
they were available and where

00:35:20.306 --> 00:35:21.996 A:middle
they made sense, we really sped

00:35:21.996 --> 00:35:25.786 A:middle
up the performance of the game.

00:35:25.826 --> 00:35:26.996 A:middle
So, here's some examples of the

00:35:26.996 --> 00:35:29.356 A:middle
physics finished product.

00:35:29.356 --> 00:35:30.466 A:middle
First one is one of the blocks

00:35:30.466 --> 00:35:30.996 A:middle
from the game.

00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:32.356 A:middle
In this case, a cylinder with

00:35:32.356 --> 00:35:33.686 A:middle
textures for a great wood grain

00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:33.876 A:middle
look.

00:35:35.116 --> 00:35:36.456 A:middle
Next is the slingshot with the

00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:37.136 A:middle
sling head idle.

00:35:37.946 --> 00:35:39.016 A:middle
We add the [inaudible] colors at

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:40.856 A:middle
RunTime using shaders and built

00:35:40.856 --> 00:35:42.086 A:middle
some custom animation for the

00:35:42.086 --> 00:35:43.326 A:middle
sling's motion during gameplay.

00:35:44.946 --> 00:35:46.416 A:middle
Lastly, we included some extra

00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:47.736 A:middle
assets that didn't get included

00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:48.286 A:middle
in the gameplay.

00:35:48.776 --> 00:35:50.036 A:middle
Even though we had to sacrifice

00:35:50.036 --> 00:35:51.416 A:middle
them, we want you to have them

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.006 A:middle
and use them in your own sample

00:35:53.546 --> 00:35:53.646 A:middle
code.

00:35:55.876 --> 00:35:57.606 A:middle
So, one of the other fun things

00:35:57.606 --> 00:35:58.916 A:middle
we included is this flag

00:35:58.916 --> 00:35:59.406 A:middle
animation.

00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:00.956 A:middle
It really improves the immersion
