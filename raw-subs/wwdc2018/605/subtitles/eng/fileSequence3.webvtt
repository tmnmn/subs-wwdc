00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.996 A:middle
those kinds of artwork and get

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:02.026 A:middle
that gameplay down.

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:03.416 A:middle
Because if it's fun with those

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.136 A:middle
boring grey boxes, it's going to

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:06.126 A:middle
be fun when you add all the

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:07.246 A:middle
graphics and sound later.

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:10.376 A:middle
You should spend time refining

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.306 A:middle
that and don't convince yourself

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:14.216 A:middle
that if I just add another 5%

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:15.546 A:middle
better graphics, or that one

00:03:15.546 --> 00:03:16.776 A:middle
feature, that the game is

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:17.746 A:middle
suddenly going to be fun.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:19.746 A:middle
Because, you know, there's a

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
wasteland of games out there

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.316 A:middle
that were never fun from the

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:22.756 A:middle
get-go.

00:03:22.926 --> 00:03:24.916 A:middle
So, try not to fool yourself.

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:28.186 A:middle
Let's start with the gameplay.

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:32.456 A:middle
Keep games short.

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:35.476 A:middle
You are looking for a typical

00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:37.606 A:middle
mobile experience still - easy

00:03:37.606 --> 00:03:38.526 A:middle
in, easy out.

00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:43.196 A:middle
You want to keep a variety of

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:44.906 A:middle
content so that it is fresh,

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:46.836 A:middle
avoid mental fatigue on the part

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:47.816 A:middle
of the player of repeating the

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:51.776 A:middle
same thing over and over again.

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:53.276 A:middle
One of the things we learned is

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.726 A:middle
that spectating the game turned

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:55.986 A:middle
out to be just as fun as playing

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:56.076 A:middle
it.

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:57.596 A:middle
Sitting there on the sidelines

00:03:57.596 --> 00:03:58.436 A:middle
and watching like it is a

00:03:58.436 --> 00:03:59.736 A:middle
sporting match going side to

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:02.426 A:middle
side, that is just a really
