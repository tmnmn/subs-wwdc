00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:00.886 A:middle
downstairs, we used a different

00:13:00.886 --> 00:13:01.306 A:middle
approach.

00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:03.316 A:middle
We spent some time during setup

00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:04.966 A:middle
for the conference recording

00:13:04.966 --> 00:13:05.966 A:middle
WorldMaps for each of the

00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:07.776 A:middle
tables, ensuring that we could

00:13:07.776 --> 00:13:09.186 A:middle
localize that shared coordinate

00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:10.486 A:middle
space from multiple angles.

00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:12.456 A:middle
Each table has its own unique

00:13:12.456 --> 00:13:13.856 A:middle
characteristics as well as

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:15.386 A:middle
slightly different lighting and

00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:15.826 A:middle
positioning.

00:13:16.286 --> 00:13:18.586 A:middle
We then saved the files to local

00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:19.726 A:middle
sstorage on each device.

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:21.946 A:middle
Since the devices in use are

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:23.116 A:middle
managed by our conference team,

00:13:23.346 --> 00:13:24.616 A:middle
we're able to use mobile device

00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:26.116 A:middle
management to make sure that the

00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:27.626 A:middle
same files are present on every

00:13:27.626 --> 00:13:29.026 A:middle
device in the game.

00:13:29.846 --> 00:13:33.676 A:middle
To make the solution even more

00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:35.506 A:middle
seamless, you can use iBeacons

00:13:35.646 --> 00:13:36.256 A:middle
on each table.

00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:38.826 A:middle
By correlating the identifier of

00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:39.866 A:middle
the iBeacon with particular

00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:41.796 A:middle
WorldMaps, each instance of the

00:13:41.796 --> 00:13:43.316 A:middle
SwiftShot application can load

00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:44.076 A:middle
the correct WorldMap

00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:44.676 A:middle
automatically.

00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:46.386 A:middle
Now, if you're building a

00:13:46.386 --> 00:13:48.626 A:middle
consumer application, you can

00:13:48.626 --> 00:13:50.736 A:middle
also use things like iOS's

00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:53.516 A:middle
on-demand resources or your own

00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:55.236 A:middle
cloud-sharing solution to share

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:56.606 A:middle
WorldMaps between devices.

00:13:57.196 --> 00:13:58.276 A:middle
This would allow you to for

00:13:58.276 --> 00:13:59.806 A:middle
instance select the correct

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:01.566 A:middle
WorldMap for a particular retail
