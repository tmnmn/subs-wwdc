00:40:59.926 --> 00:41:01.076 A:middle
We found that we're able to

00:41:01.076 --> 00:41:03.056 A:middle
build that tool using Swift but

00:41:03.056 --> 00:41:04.336 A:middle
set it up as a command line

00:41:04.336 --> 00:41:04.596 A:middle
tool.

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.706 A:middle
Do you notice at the top of

00:41:06.706 --> 00:41:07.996 A:middle
this, the traditional Unix

00:41:07.996 --> 00:41:09.566 A:middle
shebang-style statement at the

00:41:09.566 --> 00:41:10.266 A:middle
top of the script.

00:41:10.706 --> 00:41:13.156 A:middle
That tells your shell to fire up

00:41:13.156 --> 00:41:15.436 A:middle
Swift to run this.

00:41:15.536 --> 00:41:17.076 A:middle
By doing this, we can then treat

00:41:17.076 --> 00:41:18.526 A:middle
Swift as a scripting language.

00:41:19.976 --> 00:41:21.226 A:middle
You can develop one of these by

00:41:21.226 --> 00:41:23.316 A:middle
using a Swift playground to work

00:41:23.316 --> 00:41:24.726 A:middle
with your code interactively and

00:41:24.726 --> 00:41:25.696 A:middle
make sure that you've gotten it

00:41:25.696 --> 00:41:25.866 A:middle
right.

00:41:26.966 --> 00:41:28.556 A:middle
Once it's ready, just save it

00:41:28.556 --> 00:41:30.286 A:middle
out to a file, add the shebang

00:41:30.286 --> 00:41:31.906 A:middle
line to the top and make the

00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:33.886 A:middle
file executable in the file

00:41:33.886 --> 00:41:34.236 A:middle
system.

00:41:35.246 --> 00:41:36.546 A:middle
Now you've got a command line

00:41:36.546 --> 00:41:38.736 A:middle
tool that you can use either,

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:39.496 A:middle
you know, outside the

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:41.876 A:middle
application or in Xcode using a

00:41:41.876 --> 00:41:42.666 A:middle
RunScript phase.

00:41:43.486 --> 00:41:45.866 A:middle
It's very easy and it really

00:41:45.866 --> 00:41:47.216 A:middle
gives you access to all the

00:41:47.216 --> 00:41:48.056 A:middle
system frameworks.

00:41:48.316 --> 00:41:49.456 A:middle
In this case, we're able to edit

00:41:49.456 --> 00:41:50.386 A:middle
the P list directly.

00:41:51.036 --> 00:41:52.076 A:middle
It's a really great technique

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:53.586 A:middle
and we hope that you'll be able

00:41:53.586 --> 00:41:54.986 A:middle
to take advantage of it.

00:41:57.116 --> 00:41:59.016 A:middle
So, today I hope you've seen how

00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:00.226 A:middle
AR provides really new
