00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.936 A:middle
top and surface, or they want to

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:02.576 A:middle
blow the board up to be the size

00:17:02.576 --> 00:17:03.646 A:middle
of a basketball court.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:07.656 A:middle
We thought about, you know,

00:17:07.656 --> 00:17:08.646 A:middle
adding that to our network

00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:10.435 A:middle
protocol alongside the WorldMap,

00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:11.536 A:middle
but then we came up with a

00:17:11.536 --> 00:17:12.126 A:middle
better solution.

00:17:13.415 --> 00:17:15.455 A:middle
We created a custom subclass of

00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:16.836 A:middle
ARAnchor that we called board

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:18.546 A:middle
anchor and added that

00:17:18.546 --> 00:17:20.165 A:middle
information to that class, the

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:20.935 A:middle
size of the board.

00:17:22.236 --> 00:17:24.796 A:middle
We then made sure that we

00:17:24.796 --> 00:17:27.026 A:middle
implemented the NSCoding

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:28.546 A:middle
required classes or override

00:17:28.546 --> 00:17:30.546 A:middle
them to include that information

00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.486 A:middle
when the object is serialized

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:32.696 A:middle
out.

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:35.076 A:middle
Now, the information is included

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:36.476 A:middle
directly within the WorldMap

00:17:36.836 --> 00:17:38.066 A:middle
when we transfer it over to the

00:17:38.066 --> 00:17:38.776 A:middle
other device.

00:17:39.146 --> 00:17:40.166 A:middle
It makes it very easy and

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:40.766 A:middle
straightforward.

00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:43.236 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind, and

00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:44.986 A:middle
this bit us for a little bit.

00:17:45.476 --> 00:17:47.996 A:middle
When you use Swift to make a

00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:50.036 A:middle
subclass like this, when you

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.136 A:middle
serialize it out, the name of

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:53.416 A:middle
the module or the name of your

00:17:53.416 --> 00:17:54.856 A:middle
application is included in the

00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:55.356 A:middle
class name.

00:17:56.016 --> 00:17:57.296 A:middle
This is something to be aware of

00:17:57.336 --> 00:17:58.406 A:middle
if you're planning to move

00:17:58.406 --> 00:17:59.786 A:middle
WorldMaps between different

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:00.556 A:middle
applications.
