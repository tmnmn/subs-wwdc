00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:02.426 A:middle
side, that is just a really

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:03.446 A:middle
enjoyable experience.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:04.866 A:middle
It's something to think about.

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.536 A:middle
Games are a key form of social

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:10.586 A:middle
and personal interaction.

00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:14.136 A:middle
Augmented reality can offer a

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:16.716 A:middle
kind of personal touch that you

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:18.646 A:middle
might have had before playing

00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:19.935 A:middle
like a traditional card game

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:20.875 A:middle
around the table with older

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:21.565 A:middle
relatives.

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:24.696 A:middle
But now you have technology to

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:25.516 A:middle
help along the way.

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:31.146 A:middle
It isn't enough to just take a

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.196 A:middle
3D game and put it on a table in

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:33.616 A:middle
front of you.

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:35.736 A:middle
With augmented reality, you know

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:36.966 A:middle
how the device is positioned.

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:39.416 A:middle
You also know a little bit about

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.566 A:middle
the user's environment and you

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:42.526 A:middle
should try to take advantage of

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:43.676 A:middle
that in the game and make

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:45.246 A:middle
experiences that are really for

00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:46.536 A:middle
augmented reality first.

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:53.076 A:middle
Your device can be used as a

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.956 A:middle
camera to look inward at an

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:56.116 A:middle
object of focus.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.116 A:middle
In this case, this is a 3D

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.686 A:middle
puzzle game where we're looking
