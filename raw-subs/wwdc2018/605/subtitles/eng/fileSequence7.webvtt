00:06:57.146 --> 00:07:00.696 A:middle
You want to encourage the player

00:07:00.696 --> 00:07:02.516 A:middle
to move around the play field In

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:05.006 A:middle
this case, our shot of the enemy

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:06.856 A:middle
slingshot is blocked by those

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:07.366 A:middle
blocks.

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:09.276 A:middle
So, we have to move over to

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:11.156 A:middle
another slingshot to clear the

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:12.000 A:middle
obstruction.

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:20.646 A:middle
Control feedback is important

00:07:20.646 --> 00:07:21.136 A:middle
for immersion.

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:24.826 A:middle
In SwiftShot, we give feedback

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:26.506 A:middle
using both audio and haptics.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:29.716 A:middle
There's a variety of dynamic

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:31.396 A:middle
behavior in the stretching band

00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:35.056 A:middle
sound and haptics on the phones

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:36.316 A:middle
to give you that feel that

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:36.826 A:middle
you're doing it.

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:38.876 A:middle
We'll talk a lot more later

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:40.036 A:middle
about the dynamic audio.

00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:44.196 A:middle
So, next I'd like to bring up

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.096 A:middle
David Paschich, who will go deep

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:47.376 A:middle
into the details of SwiftShot.

00:07:47.786 --> 00:07:48.666 A:middle
Thank you.

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:50.486 A:middle
David?

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:55.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Alex, and hello,

00:07:55.086 --> 00:07:55.536 A:middle
everybody.

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:58.256 A:middle
I just want to echo what Alex

00:07:58.256 --> 00:07:58.546 A:middle
said.

00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
The response that we've seen
