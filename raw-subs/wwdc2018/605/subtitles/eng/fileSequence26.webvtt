00:26:00.876 --> 00:26:02.856 A:middle
we're able to eliminate the sign

00:26:02.856 --> 00:26:05.666 A:middle
bit by normalizing that between

00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:07.206 A:middle
0 and 80 meters, even though our

00:26:07.206 --> 00:26:08.356 A:middle
origin is at the center of the

00:26:08.356 --> 00:26:08.646 A:middle
table.

00:26:09.446 --> 00:26:10.556 A:middle
Now all values are positive.

00:26:11.196 --> 00:26:13.966 A:middle
We then scale that value to be

00:26:13.966 --> 00:26:15.096 A:middle
in a range of 0 to 1.

00:26:15.696 --> 00:26:16.636 A:middle
That way we don't need the

00:26:16.636 --> 00:26:17.866 A:middle
exponent information that's

00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:20.626 A:middle
inherent in the protocol.

00:26:21.176 --> 00:26:24.366 A:middle
And then lastly, we take that

00:26:24.366 --> 00:26:25.786 A:middle
and we scale it to the number of

00:26:25.786 --> 00:26:29.136 A:middle
bits available so that all 1s is

00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:31.876 A:middle
a floating point 1 and all 0s is

00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:32.806 A:middle
the floating point 0.

00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:35.356 A:middle
This gave us millimeter scale

00:26:35.356 --> 00:26:37.376 A:middle
precision which, as we

00:26:37.376 --> 00:26:39.296 A:middle
discovered, was really enough to

00:26:39.296 --> 00:26:40.716 A:middle
achieve that smooth synchronous

00:26:40.906 --> 00:26:43.296 A:middle
appearance in the game.

00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:44.816 A:middle
Now, we did a similar technique

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:46.026 A:middle
for all the other values that

00:26:46.026 --> 00:26:46.546 A:middle
you saw.

00:26:46.716 --> 00:26:48.526 A:middle
The velocity, angular velocity

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:49.466 A:middle
and orientation.

00:26:50.336 --> 00:26:52.326 A:middle
Tailing the ranges and the

00:26:52.326 --> 00:26:53.906 A:middle
number of bits for each to

00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:54.806 A:middle
really make sure that we

00:26:55.226 --> 00:26:56.526 A:middle
transmit the information using

00:26:56.526 --> 00:26:57.436 A:middle
the minimal amount of data.

00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.356 A:middle
Overall, we reduce the number of
