00:23:01.576 --> 00:23:03.046 A:middle
So, let's talk next about the

00:23:03.046 --> 00:23:04.326 A:middle
physics simulation in the game.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.106 A:middle
For a game like SwiftShot,

00:23:06.726 --> 00:23:08.156 A:middle
physics is really key to create

00:23:08.156 --> 00:23:10.206 A:middle
a fun interaction that comes

00:23:10.206 --> 00:23:11.296 A:middle
from the realistic interaction

00:23:11.296 --> 00:23:12.316 A:middle
between objects and the game.

00:23:12.816 --> 00:23:14.146 A:middle
It's a really great experience

00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:16.106 A:middle
to take that shot and bounce it

00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:17.556 A:middle
off an object in a game and take

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:18.526 A:middle
out the opponent's slingshot.

00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:20.676 A:middle
And that really comes from the

00:23:20.676 --> 00:23:21.466 A:middle
physics simulation.

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:25.066 A:middle
We use SceneKit's built-in

00:23:25.066 --> 00:23:25.656 A:middle
physics engine.

00:23:25.986 --> 00:23:26.886 A:middle
It's integrated with the

00:23:26.886 --> 00:23:28.336 A:middle
rendering engine, updating

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:29.476 A:middle
positions of the object and

00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:30.996 A:middle
scene automatically, and

00:23:30.996 --> 00:23:32.676 A:middle
informing us of collisions using

00:23:32.676 --> 00:23:33.196 A:middle
delegation.

00:23:34.616 --> 00:23:35.966 A:middle
In our implementation, we

00:23:35.966 --> 00:23:37.286 A:middle
decided that the best approach

00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:39.426 A:middle
was for one device in the

00:23:39.426 --> 00:23:40.516 A:middle
session to act as a source of

00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:41.576 A:middle
truth or server.

00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.306 A:middle
It sends periodic updates about

00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:45.846 A:middle
the physics state to the other

00:23:45.846 --> 00:23:47.596 A:middle
devices in the network using

00:23:47.596 --> 00:23:49.026 A:middle
that multi-peer connectivity

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:50.876 A:middle
broadcast method.

00:23:52.706 --> 00:23:55.716 A:middle
Now, the other devices also have

00:23:55.756 --> 00:23:56.986 A:middle
the physics simulation on.

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:58.856 A:middle
That's because we don't send

00:23:58.856 --> 00:24:00.436 A:middle
information about every object
