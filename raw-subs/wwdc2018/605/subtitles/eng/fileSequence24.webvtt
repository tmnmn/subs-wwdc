00:23:58.856 --> 00:24:00.436 A:middle
information about every object

00:24:00.436 --> 00:24:02.246 A:middle
in the game, only those objects

00:24:02.246 --> 00:24:03.156 A:middle
that are relevant to the

00:24:03.156 --> 00:24:04.606 A:middle
gameplay such as the box,

00:24:04.606 --> 00:24:06.066 A:middle
projectile and catapult.

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:09.216 A:middle
Things like simulating the

00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:10.286 A:middle
swinging of the rope and the

00:24:10.286 --> 00:24:13.136 A:middle
sling, particles and so forth,

00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:15.446 A:middle
those are just done locally on

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:16.726 A:middle
each device since it's not

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:18.166 A:middle
critical to the game that they

00:24:18.166 --> 00:24:19.166 A:middle
be in the same place on every

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:19.646 A:middle
device.

00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:24.886 A:middle
Now, one of the things that we

00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:26.016 A:middle
discovered was when we were

00:24:26.016 --> 00:24:28.366 A:middle
doing this was that the physics

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:29.336 A:middle
engine responded very

00:24:29.336 --> 00:24:30.466 A:middle
differently depending on the

00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:31.616 A:middle
scale of the objects.

00:24:32.246 --> 00:24:33.966 A:middle
And so the physics simulation

00:24:33.966 --> 00:24:35.466 A:middle
thinks the objects are about 10

00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:36.876 A:middle
times the size as you would see

00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:37.676 A:middle
them in the real world.

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:39.386 A:middle
We found that gave the best

00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:41.756 A:middle
gameplay experience and the best

00:24:41.756 --> 00:24:42.336 A:middle
performance.

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:44.516 A:middle
We had to tweak some of the laws

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:45.766 A:middle
of physics to make that look

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:47.216 A:middle
right but, you know, when you're

00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:48.616 A:middle
building a game, if it looks

00:24:48.616 --> 00:24:49.966 A:middle
right and feels right and it's

00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:53.616 A:middle
fun, then it is right.

00:24:53.856 --> 00:24:55.426 A:middle
Now, to share that physics state

00:24:55.586 --> 00:24:56.546 A:middle
and make sure everything looked

00:24:56.546 --> 00:24:57.996 A:middle
right, we need to share four

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.056 A:middle
pieces of information.

00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:00.336 A:middle
The position.
