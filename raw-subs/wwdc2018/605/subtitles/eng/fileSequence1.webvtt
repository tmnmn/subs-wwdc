engaging AR experiences.

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:02.576 A:middle
And you are able to reach the

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:03.786 A:middle
widest possible audience with

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:04.025 A:middle
that.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:06.756 A:middle
There is no special setup, just

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.546 A:middle
point the device's camera at a

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.916 A:middle
surface and start playing.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:13.896 A:middle
It's integrated into iOS.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.206 A:middle
First-party and third-party

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:17.346 A:middle
engines like SceneKit and

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:19.826 A:middle
SpriteKit as well as third-party

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.396 A:middle
ones like Unreal and Unity have

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:23.486 A:middle
a full integration at this

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:24.000 A:middle
point.

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:29.686 A:middle
A little agenda for you.

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.976 A:middle
First we're going to talk some

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:32.896 A:middle
game design principles for

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:34.216 A:middle
augmented reality, a few of the

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:35.666 A:middle
things we learned along the way.

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:38.336 A:middle
We are going to go deep into the

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:40.186 A:middle
internals of the game and in

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:40.976 A:middle
particular, we are going to

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.426 A:middle
cover WorldMap sharing which is

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:43.676 A:middle
a new feature in ARKit 2.

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.556 A:middle
And we will also talk about

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:46.816 A:middle
networking and physics and how

00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:47.726 A:middle
we made that work.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:51.006 A:middle
First, let's, you know, take a

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:54.426 A:middle
deep look at the game.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:02:29.500 A:middle
