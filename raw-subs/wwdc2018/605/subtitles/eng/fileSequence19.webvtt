00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:00.936 A:middle
either in network data size or

00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:01.536 A:middle
computation.

00:19:01.646 --> 00:19:02.666 A:middle
So there's really no reason not

00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:04.306 A:middle
to use it.

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:06.616 A:middle
Multi-peer connectivity also

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:08.596 A:middle
provides APIs for advertisements

00:19:08.696 --> 00:19:09.316 A:middle
and discovery.

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:11.256 A:middle
We use this to broadcast

00:19:11.256 --> 00:19:12.476 A:middle
available games and allow

00:19:12.536 --> 00:19:13.596 A:middle
players to select a game to

00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:14.316 A:middle
join.

00:19:14.956 --> 00:19:16.056 A:middle
So, here's how we get that

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:16.616 A:middle
session set up.

00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:19.116 A:middle
First, on one device, the user

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.906 A:middle
decides to set themselves up as

00:19:20.906 --> 00:19:21.936 A:middle
hosts for the application.

00:19:23.356 --> 00:19:24.746 A:middle
They scan the world, place the

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:27.456 A:middle
gameboard within that world, and

00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:29.026 A:middle
then the device starts a new

00:19:29.026 --> 00:19:30.516 A:middle
session, a multi-peer

00:19:30.516 --> 00:19:31.966 A:middle
connectivity session, and starts

00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:33.486 A:middle
advertising it to other devices

00:19:33.486 --> 00:19:34.806 A:middle
on the local network.

00:19:35.476 --> 00:19:37.866 A:middle
A user on the other device sees

00:19:37.866 --> 00:19:39.036 A:middle
a list of available games.

00:19:39.546 --> 00:19:41.856 A:middle
When he selects one, his device

00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:42.916 A:middle
sends a request to join the

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:43.716 A:middle
existing session.

00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:47.186 A:middle
Once the first device accepts

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.346 A:middle
the request, multi-peer

00:19:48.346 --> 00:19:49.686 A:middle
connectivity sets up a true

00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:50.526 A:middle
peer-to-peer network.

00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:53.226 A:middle
Any device in the network can

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:54.266 A:middle
send a message to any other

00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:55.126 A:middle
device in the network.

00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:58.246 A:middle
In SwiftShot, we designate the

00:19:58.246 --> 00:19:59.576 A:middle
device that started the session

00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:00.796 A:middle
as the source of truth for the
