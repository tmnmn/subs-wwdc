The response that we've seen

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:01.136 A:middle
from people here at the show to

00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:02.596 A:middle
SwiftShot has been really

00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:04.196 A:middle
amazing and it's been gratifying

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:05.496 A:middle
to see some people already

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:07.106 A:middle
downloading it, building it and

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.266 A:middle
altering it from the sample

00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:08.606 A:middle
code.

00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:09.746 A:middle
So, I thank you for that.

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:10.966 A:middle
We're really excited about that.

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:13.476 A:middle
I want to talk by talking first

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:15.246 A:middle
about the technologies we used

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.126 A:middle
in building SwiftShot.

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:18.736 A:middle
The first and foremost is ARKit,

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.766 A:middle
which lets us render the content

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:22.416 A:middle
into the physical world around

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:23.656 A:middle
the players, immersing them in

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:24.396 A:middle
the experience.

00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:28.636 A:middle
We use SceneKit to manage and

00:08:28.636 --> 00:08:30.096 A:middle
draw that content, using

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:31.896 A:middle
advanced 3D rendering and

00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:33.106 A:middle
realistic physics for fun

00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:33.466 A:middle
gameplay.

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:36.686 A:middle
Metal lets us harness the power

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:39.686 A:middle
of the GPU devices.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.655 A:middle
It came into play both within

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.256 A:middle
SceneKit for the shading and

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.346 A:middle
rendering and also for the flag

00:08:45.346 --> 00:08:46.346 A:middle
simulation, which I'll talk

00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:48.166 A:middle
about a little later on.

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.406 A:middle
GameplayKit provides an entity

00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:52.046 A:middle
component architecture for our

00:08:52.046 --> 00:08:52.666 A:middle
game object.

00:08:52.786 --> 00:08:54.526 A:middle
It let us easily share behaviors

00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:57.506 A:middle
between objects in the game.

00:08:57.716 --> 00:08:59.566 A:middle
Multi-peer connectivity provides

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:01.676 A:middle
the networking layer, including
