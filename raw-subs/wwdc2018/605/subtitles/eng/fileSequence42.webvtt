00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:00.226 A:middle
AR provides really new

00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:01.626 A:middle
opportunities for engaging games

00:42:01.626 --> 00:42:02.706 A:middle
and other experiences.

00:42:03.746 --> 00:42:04.986 A:middle
We encourage you to design with

00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:06.006 A:middle
AR in mind from the start.

00:42:06.346 --> 00:42:07.866 A:middle
And remember that for games, the

00:42:07.866 --> 00:42:08.606 A:middle
play is the thing.

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:10.856 A:middle
You can't sprinkle fun on top at

00:42:10.976 --> 00:42:12.000 A:middle
the end.

00:42:13.146 --> 00:42:14.056 A:middle
We really hope that you'll

00:42:14.056 --> 00:42:15.966 A:middle
download the SwiftShot available

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.456 A:middle
as sample code and use it to

00:42:17.456 --> 00:42:18.696 A:middle
guide you as you build your own

00:42:18.696 --> 00:42:20.316 A:middle
apps and we're planning to

00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:21.826 A:middle
update that with each subsequent

00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:23.976 A:middle
seed of iOS 12 as we go to the

00:42:23.976 --> 00:42:24.306 A:middle
release.

00:42:24.906 --> 00:42:27.316 A:middle
And finally, if you haven't had

00:42:27.316 --> 00:42:28.636 A:middle
a chance yet, we hope you'll

00:42:28.636 --> 00:42:29.596 A:middle
play SwiftShot with us

00:42:29.786 --> 00:42:32.326 A:middle
downstairs in the game room.

00:42:32.456 --> 00:42:34.136 A:middle
For more information, there's an

00:42:34.136 --> 00:42:35.536 A:middle
ARKit lab immediately after this

00:42:35.536 --> 00:42:36.656 A:middle
session and the get together

00:42:36.656 --> 00:42:37.176 A:middle
this evening.

00:42:37.836 --> 00:42:39.406 A:middle
I'm also happy to announce that

00:42:39.406 --> 00:42:40.196 A:middle
for those of you here at the

00:42:40.196 --> 00:42:41.536 A:middle
conference, we're going to have

00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:42.696 A:middle
a SwiftShot tournament this

00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:44.566 A:middle
Friday from noon to 2, so we

00:42:44.566 --> 00:42:45.586 A:middle
hope you'll join us for that.

00:42:46.496 --> 00:42:47.186 A:middle
Thank you very much.
