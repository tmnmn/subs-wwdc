00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:00.956 A:middle
It really improves the immersion

00:36:00.956 --> 00:36:01.866 A:middle
in the game environment.

00:36:02.626 --> 00:36:04.076 A:middle
We wanted a realistic wind

00:36:04.076 --> 00:36:04.896 A:middle
effect on this.

00:36:05.156 --> 00:36:06.296 A:middle
Now, we could've used a cloth

00:36:06.386 --> 00:36:07.656 A:middle
simulation out of the physics

00:36:07.656 --> 00:36:07.976 A:middle
engine.

00:36:09.506 --> 00:36:11.026 A:middle
But instead, we decided to use

00:36:11.026 --> 00:36:12.846 A:middle
the GPU and do it with Metal.

00:36:14.736 --> 00:36:16.626 A:middle
We started with a SceneKit asset

00:36:16.626 --> 00:36:17.976 A:middle
built by our technical artist.

00:36:18.516 --> 00:36:19.566 A:middle
To get the Apple logo on the

00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:21.946 A:middle
flag, we applied a texture at

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:22.336 A:middle
RunTime.

00:36:23.716 --> 00:36:25.026 A:middle
Then we built a Swift class

00:36:25.026 --> 00:36:26.136 A:middle
around the Metal device.

00:36:26.806 --> 00:36:28.506 A:middle
Swift code builds a metal

00:36:28.506 --> 00:36:29.746 A:middle
command queue and inserts

00:36:29.746 --> 00:36:31.126 A:middle
information from the state of

00:36:31.126 --> 00:36:32.736 A:middle
the game, such as the direction

00:36:32.736 --> 00:36:34.466 A:middle
the wind is blowing.

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:35.706 A:middle
That command queue is running a

00:36:35.706 --> 00:36:37.016 A:middle
custom Metal compute shader.

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:39.046 A:middle
That comes from a legacy code

00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:39.816 A:middle
built in C.

00:36:40.176 --> 00:36:41.536 A:middle
But because Metal is based on

00:36:41.536 --> 00:36:43.916 A:middle
modern C++, it was a very easy

00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:44.726 A:middle
conversion to make.

00:36:45.826 --> 00:36:47.486 A:middle
We then also run another compute

00:36:47.486 --> 00:36:49.226 A:middle
shader to compute normal for the

00:36:49.226 --> 00:36:50.966 A:middle
surface, so we can get a great,

00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:53.426 A:middle
smooth flag look without a huge

00:36:53.426 --> 00:36:54.716 A:middle
number of polygons in the scene.

00:36:55.196 --> 00:36:56.646 A:middle
And it really makes the flag

00:36:56.646 --> 00:36:57.156 A:middle
look amazing.

00:36:58.296 --> 00:37:00.586 A:middle
Each frame, the shader updates
