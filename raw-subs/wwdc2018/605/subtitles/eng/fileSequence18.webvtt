00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:00.556 A:middle
applications.

00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:02.556 A:middle
NSKeyedArchiver can help you

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:03.906 A:middle
accommodate that.

00:18:04.676 --> 00:18:06.306 A:middle
So, that's WorldMap sharing.

00:18:06.756 --> 00:18:08.976 A:middle
It's a new feature in iOS 12.

00:18:09.136 --> 00:18:10.156 A:middle
We're really looking forward to

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:11.716 A:middle
seeing what everyone can build

00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:14.336 A:middle
with that.

00:18:14.536 --> 00:18:15.376 A:middle
Next, let's talk about the

00:18:15.376 --> 00:18:17.466 A:middle
networking we built into the

00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:17.936 A:middle
game.

00:18:17.936 --> 00:18:19.566 A:middle
We used iOS's multi-peer

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:21.236 A:middle
connectivity API which has been

00:18:21.236 --> 00:18:22.906 A:middle
in the system since iOS 7 in

00:18:22.906 --> 00:18:23.746 A:middle
order to do this.

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:25.856 A:middle
Multi-peer connectivity.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.146 A:middle
Allows us to set up a

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:28.626 A:middle
peer-to-peer session on a local

00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:30.776 A:middle
network, allowing devices in the

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.246 A:middle
session to communicate without

00:18:32.246 --> 00:18:33.206 A:middle
going through a dedicated

00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:33.516 A:middle
server.

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:35.616 A:middle
Now, in our application, we

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:37.126 A:middle
designate one of the devices as

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.026 A:middle
the server but that's something

00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:40.286 A:middle
that we did for our application.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.146 A:middle
It's not inherent in the

00:18:41.146 --> 00:18:41.516 A:middle
protocol.

00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:44.346 A:middle
Encryption and authentication

00:18:44.346 --> 00:18:45.536 A:middle
are built into multi-peer

00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:46.146 A:middle
connectivity.

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.006 A:middle
In our case, we didn't use

00:18:48.006 --> 00:18:49.436 A:middle
authentication because we wanted

00:18:49.436 --> 00:18:50.506 A:middle
a very quick in-and-out

00:18:50.506 --> 00:18:52.336 A:middle
experience but we did use

00:18:52.396 --> 00:18:52.966 A:middle
encryption.

00:18:53.516 --> 00:18:54.596 A:middle
We found that turning on

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:56.276 A:middle
encryption really provided no

00:18:56.276 --> 00:18:58.016 A:middle
performance penalty, so there's

00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:00.936 A:middle
either in network data size or
