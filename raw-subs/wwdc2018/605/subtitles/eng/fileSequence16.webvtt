00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.606 A:middle
data while at rest.

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:03.496 A:middle
I'll talk next about how we did

00:16:03.496 --> 00:16:05.246 A:middle
the networking for encryption,

00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:06.526 A:middle
on the networking.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:10.496 A:middle
Now, in addition to setting up

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:12.616 A:middle
shared coordinate space for

00:16:12.616 --> 00:16:14.006 A:middle
SwiftShot, we needed to tell the

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.416 A:middle
other device where the user has

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:16.716 A:middle
chosen to locate the board.

00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:19.266 A:middle
We use an ARAnchor to do this.

00:16:19.676 --> 00:16:21.666 A:middle
When you create an ARAnchor, you

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.536 A:middle
provide a name as well as

00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:24.736 A:middle
position and rotation

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:26.386 A:middle
information as a 4 x 4

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:26.836 A:middle
transform.

00:16:27.306 --> 00:16:30.236 A:middle
ARKit can then include the

00:16:30.236 --> 00:16:32.176 A:middle
Anchor in the ARWorldMap we

00:16:32.176 --> 00:16:34.386 A:middle
generate and serialize out, and

00:16:34.386 --> 00:16:35.476 A:middle
then, so we can transfer that

00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:36.936 A:middle
board information to the other

00:16:36.936 --> 00:16:37.496 A:middle
device.

00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:40.906 A:middle
Now, the system ARAnchor class

00:16:40.906 --> 00:16:42.576 A:middle
just has the name and the

00:16:42.576 --> 00:16:43.836 A:middle
orientation we created.

00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:45.656 A:middle
We can look up the anchor that

00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:46.846 A:middle
we're interested in by name on

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:47.406 A:middle
the other side.

00:16:48.036 --> 00:16:49.286 A:middle
For our application though, we

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:50.596 A:middle
need to include some additional

00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:51.946 A:middle
information for the other

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:53.946 A:middle
device, and that's the size that

00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:55.976 A:middle
the user chose for that board,

00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:57.456 A:middle
deciding whether they're playing

00:16:57.456 --> 00:16:59.356 A:middle
on a, you know, a small table

00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.936 A:middle
top and surface, or they want to
