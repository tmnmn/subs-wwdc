00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:00.336 A:middle
The position.

00:25:01.956 --> 00:25:03.026 A:middle
The velocity.

00:25:04.356 --> 00:25:05.856 A:middle
The angular velocity.

00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:07.486 A:middle
And the orientation.

00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:09.566 A:middle
That's a lot of information

00:25:09.566 --> 00:25:10.666 A:middle
about every object in the game,

00:25:11.056 --> 00:25:12.846 A:middle
so it was vital that we minimize

00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:13.886 A:middle
the number of bits actually

00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:14.256 A:middle
used.

00:25:15.006 --> 00:25:16.266 A:middle
I'll walk you through that using

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:18.946 A:middle
position as an example.

00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:20.556 A:middle
SceneKit represents position as

00:25:20.556 --> 00:25:21.926 A:middle
a vector of three floating point

00:25:21.926 --> 00:25:22.406 A:middle
values.

00:25:22.766 --> 00:25:24.996 A:middle
This is the native format and

00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:26.646 A:middle
gives the best performance for

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:27.896 A:middle
calculations at run time.

00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:31.416 A:middle
However, there are really more

00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:33.416 A:middle
bits than necessary to specify

00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:34.366 A:middle
the object's location.

00:25:35.226 --> 00:25:37.256 A:middle
A 30-bit float has 8-bits of

00:25:37.256 --> 00:25:38.686 A:middle
exponent and 23 bits of

00:25:38.686 --> 00:25:39.256 A:middle
mantissa.

00:25:39.366 --> 00:25:41.386 A:middle
For a range of plus or minus 10

00:25:41.386 --> 00:25:42.656 A:middle
to the 38th meters.

00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:44.566 A:middle
It's way more than we need for

00:25:44.566 --> 00:25:47.166 A:middle
this game.

00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:48.506 A:middle
So, because the physics

00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:50.026 A:middle
simulation thinks our table is

00:25:50.126 --> 00:25:52.486 A:middle
28 meters long, we said you

00:25:52.486 --> 00:25:54.006 A:middle
know, 80 meters is going to give

00:25:54.006 --> 00:25:55.506 A:middle
us plenty of buffer space around

00:25:55.506 --> 00:25:56.506 A:middle
that on either side.

00:25:57.816 --> 00:25:59.876 A:middle
When we're coding that then,
