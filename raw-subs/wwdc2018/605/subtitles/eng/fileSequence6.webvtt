00:05:56.736 --> 00:06:01.576 A:middle
The device can also be a portal

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:02.726 A:middle
into an alternate universe.

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:04.056 A:middle
You don't need to see what the

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:05.186 A:middle
camera sees directly.

00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:07.376 A:middle
The environment can be entirely

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:07.976 A:middle
replaced.

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.286 A:middle
Laws of physics can be bent or

00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:11.446 A:middle
completely changed.

00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:13.226 A:middle
Whatever you need to do to make

00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:13.636 A:middle
it fun.

00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:15.196 A:middle
In this case, we're able to see

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:16.156 A:middle
the stars, even though it's

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:16.796 A:middle
bright daylight.

00:06:17.946 --> 00:06:22.316 A:middle
Also, your device can be the

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.966 A:middle
controller itself.

00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:27.296 A:middle
You're able to fuse yourself

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:29.386 A:middle
with the virtual world using the

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:30.376 A:middle
device as the controller.

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.736 A:middle
In this example, we're sort of

00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:34.376 A:middle
magnetically levitating blocks

00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:35.556 A:middle
and placing them in the sorting

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:35.886 A:middle
cube.

00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:37.526 A:middle
That's the focus of the

00:06:37.526 --> 00:06:38.586 A:middle
interaction in SwiftShot.

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:40.996 A:middle
You want to encourage slow

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:41.996 A:middle
movement of the device.

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:44.106 A:middle
That gives the best images to

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:45.426 A:middle
the camera without motion blur

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:46.686 A:middle
and it can do the best job at

00:06:46.686 --> 00:06:47.136 A:middle
tracking.

00:06:48.186 --> 00:06:50.256 A:middle
And despite how thin and light

00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:52.386 A:middle
these devices are, waving them

00:06:52.386 --> 00:06:53.676 A:middle
all around at arm's length turns

00:06:53.676 --> 00:06:54.616 A:middle
out to be a little bit tiring.

00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:55.886 A:middle
So, you're looking for slow and

00:06:55.886 --> 00:06:56.876 A:middle
deliberate movements.

00:06:57.146 --> 00:07:00.696 A:middle
You want to encourage the player
