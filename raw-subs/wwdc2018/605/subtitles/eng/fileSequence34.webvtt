00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:00.306 A:middle
part of our build process on

00:34:00.306 --> 00:34:02.336 A:middle
macOS and include the SceneKit

00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:04.016 A:middle
files directly in our iOS build

00:34:04.016 --> 00:34:04.776 A:middle
in the application.

00:34:06.496 --> 00:34:08.315 A:middle
We structured the data so that

00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:10.346 A:middle
each individual type of block is

00:34:10.346 --> 00:34:12.646 A:middle
its own file and then for each

00:34:12.646 --> 00:34:14.106 A:middle
levels, we combine those blocks

00:34:14.106 --> 00:34:14.466 A:middle
together.

00:34:15.476 --> 00:34:17.186 A:middle
This let us iterate on the

00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:18.636 A:middle
appearance and physics behavior

00:34:18.636 --> 00:34:20.396 A:middle
of each individual block and

00:34:20.396 --> 00:34:21.896 A:middle
then pull them all together for

00:34:21.896 --> 00:34:23.295 A:middle
those levels and iterate on

00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:24.036 A:middle
gameplay design.

00:34:24.346 --> 00:34:25.335 A:middle
Try out some of the different

00:34:25.335 --> 00:34:26.306 A:middle
levels that you'll see if you

00:34:26.306 --> 00:34:27.466 A:middle
look in the source code to the

00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:28.025 A:middle
application.

00:34:30.116 --> 00:34:32.275 A:middle
To optimize, further optimize

00:34:32.275 --> 00:34:33.576 A:middle
for different distances,

00:34:33.926 --> 00:34:35.206 A:middle
SceneKit supports varying the

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:37.116 A:middle
assets used based on the level

00:34:37.116 --> 00:34:37.946 A:middle
of detail required.

00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:40.806 A:middle
Nearby objects use more polygons

00:34:40.806 --> 00:34:42.446 A:middle
and more detailed textures while

00:34:42.446 --> 00:34:43.735 A:middle
far away objects use fewer

00:34:43.735 --> 00:34:45.005 A:middle
polygons and less detailed

00:34:45.005 --> 00:34:45.466 A:middle
textures.

00:34:46.005 --> 00:34:47.216 A:middle
This really optimizes the

00:34:47.216 --> 00:34:50.996 A:middle
rendering of the scene.

00:34:51.156 --> 00:34:52.806 A:middle
However, we still want the

00:34:52.806 --> 00:34:54.096 A:middle
gameplay to stay consistent.

00:34:54.466 --> 00:34:55.876 A:middle
And so we specified the physics

00:34:55.876 --> 00:34:56.775 A:middle
body separately.

00:34:57.886 --> 00:34:58.966 A:middle
SceneKit provides a number of

00:34:58.966 --> 00:35:00.556 A:middle
built-in physics body types such
