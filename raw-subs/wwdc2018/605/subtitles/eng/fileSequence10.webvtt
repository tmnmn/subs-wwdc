00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.926 A:middle
The key in the experience is

00:10:00.926 --> 00:10:02.196 A:middle
having the player see the same

00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:03.636 A:middle
object in the same places on

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:04.406 A:middle
both devices.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.186 A:middle
To do that, we have to have a

00:10:06.186 --> 00:10:07.216 A:middle
shared coordinate space,

00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:09.386 A:middle
allowing them to talk about

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:10.896 A:middle
locations in the world in the

00:10:10.896 --> 00:10:12.000 A:middle
same way.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.076 A:middle
ARKit provides a number of

00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:16.406 A:middle
features you can use to set this

00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:16.606 A:middle
up.

00:10:17.126 --> 00:10:20.056 A:middle
In iOS 11.3, we introduced image

00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:21.596 A:middle
recognition, allowing your apps

00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:22.926 A:middle
to recognize images in the world

00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:23.366 A:middle
around you.

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:27.036 A:middle
Now in iOS 12, we're adding two

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:28.926 A:middle
additional technologies - object

00:10:28.926 --> 00:10:30.966 A:middle
detection and world map sharing.

00:10:32.356 --> 00:10:34.046 A:middle
Both image detection and object

00:10:34.046 --> 00:10:35.896 A:middle
detection let you add content to

00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
things the user sees in the real

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:38.836 A:middle
world but they require you to

00:10:38.836 --> 00:10:40.106 A:middle
have pre-recorded those objects

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:41.086 A:middle
for later recognition.

00:10:41.696 --> 00:10:42.656 A:middle
You saw that in the keynote

00:10:42.656 --> 00:10:43.616 A:middle
during the Lego demo,

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:45.196 A:middle
recognizing built models and

00:10:45.196 --> 00:10:45.936 A:middle
adding content.

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.966 A:middle
For this game, we wanted to

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.316 A:middle
enable users to play anywhere

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.556 A:middle
with a table such as a cafÃ©,

00:10:51.556 --> 00:10:52.816 A:middle
their kitchen and so forth.

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:54.286 A:middle
WorldMap sharing is how we did

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:55.306 A:middle
that.

00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:56.556 A:middle
You can also apply this

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:57.566 A:middle
technique to applications

00:10:57.566 --> 00:10:59.086 A:middle
besides games, like a fixed

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:00.236 A:middle
installation in a retail
