00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:00.746 A:middle
That made it easy to quickly

00:38:00.746 --> 00:38:01.796 A:middle
play the right sound at the

00:38:01.796 --> 00:38:03.146 A:middle
right time in response to user

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:04.266 A:middle
inputs and collisions in the

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:04.486 A:middle
game.

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:08.046 A:middle
We didn't just play the sounds

00:38:08.046 --> 00:38:08.536 A:middle
as is.

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:10.316 A:middle
To give good feedback to the

00:38:10.316 --> 00:38:11.316 A:middle
user, we pull back on the

00:38:11.316 --> 00:38:11.806 A:middle
slingshot.

00:38:12.146 --> 00:38:13.776 A:middle
We vary the sound in a couple of

00:38:13.776 --> 00:38:14.146 A:middle
ways.

00:38:14.856 --> 00:38:16.536 A:middle
We change the pitch based on how

00:38:16.536 --> 00:38:17.866 A:middle
far back they've pulled the

00:38:17.866 --> 00:38:18.396 A:middle
slingshot.

00:38:19.456 --> 00:38:23.546 A:middle
And we vary the volume based on

00:38:23.546 --> 00:38:24.796 A:middle
the speed as you pull back.

00:38:24.796 --> 00:38:26.406 A:middle
And we do that at RunTime by

00:38:26.406 --> 00:38:27.546 A:middle
selecting the right Midi note

00:38:27.546 --> 00:38:29.656 A:middle
and then using some additional

00:38:29.656 --> 00:38:30.946 A:middle
Midi commands to alter that

00:38:30.946 --> 00:38:31.876 A:middle
sound before we play it.

00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:33.746 A:middle
So, let's take a listen and this

00:38:33.746 --> 00:38:35.000 A:middle
is, we'll play it.

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:53.246 A:middle
[ Sound effects ]

00:38:53.746 --> 00:38:55.896 A:middle
Now, we also wanted to make sure

00:38:55.896 --> 00:38:56.816 A:middle
that when you're using the

00:38:56.816 --> 00:38:59.086 A:middle
slingshot, we also give users

00:38:59.496 --> 00:39:01.496 A:middle
some audio feedback as to
