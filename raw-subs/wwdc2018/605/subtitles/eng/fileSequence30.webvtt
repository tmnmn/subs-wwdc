00:29:59.726 --> 00:30:00.996 A:middle
We really, if we don't remember

00:30:00.996 --> 00:30:01.866 A:middle
this, we're just going to end up

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:02.576 A:middle
in a bad place.

00:30:03.836 --> 00:30:05.706 A:middle
So, we took a look at this and

00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:07.116 A:middle
figured out that there was a way

00:30:07.116 --> 00:30:10.896 A:middle
that Swift can help us do this.

00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:12.406 A:middle
So, we used a new feature in

00:30:12.406 --> 00:30:14.956 A:middle
Swift 4.2, which is case

00:30:14.956 --> 00:30:15.386 A:middle
iterable.

00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:19.386 A:middle
We added that protocol

00:30:19.816 --> 00:30:21.606 A:middle
compliance to our enum type.

00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:24.696 A:middle
When you do that, Swift adds a

00:30:24.696 --> 00:30:26.596 A:middle
new static member of the type

00:30:26.886 --> 00:30:28.336 A:middle
called all cases, containing

00:30:28.336 --> 00:30:29.856 A:middle
each of the cases in the enum.

00:30:30.676 --> 00:30:32.216 A:middle
That lets us automatically get a

00:30:32.216 --> 00:30:33.826 A:middle
count of the number of cases.

00:30:34.976 --> 00:30:36.436 A:middle
We then added another extension,

00:30:36.816 --> 00:30:37.706 A:middle
this time on the raw

00:30:37.706 --> 00:30:39.426 A:middle
representable type which all

00:30:39.426 --> 00:30:41.146 A:middle
enums with number types like

00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:42.466 A:middle
that conform to.

00:30:43.106 --> 00:30:44.726 A:middle
Where it's case iterable and

00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:45.736 A:middle
where that number is affixed

00:30:45.736 --> 00:30:46.256 A:middle
with integer.

00:30:47.036 --> 00:30:47.876 A:middle
And to this, we get to

00:30:47.876 --> 00:30:49.616 A:middle
automatically take those number

00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:51.176 A:middle
of cases and figure out how many

00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:53.246 A:middle
bits it takes to represent all

00:30:53.246 --> 00:30:56.176 A:middle
those cases on the wire.

00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:58.386 A:middle
Lastly, we added a generic

00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:00.606 A:middle
method on the writable BitStream
