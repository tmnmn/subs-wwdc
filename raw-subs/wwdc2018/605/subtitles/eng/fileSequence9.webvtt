00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:01.676 A:middle
the networking layer, including

00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:03.426 A:middle
discovery of nearby devices and

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:05.716 A:middle
synchronization, and encryption

00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:05.976 A:middle
as well.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:09.206 A:middle
AV Foundation controls both the

00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:11.056 A:middle
music for atmosphere and the

00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:13.186 A:middle
sound effects for the devices,

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.236 A:middle
really giving you that immersive

00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:14.846 A:middle
experience.

00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:17.706 A:middle
And lastly, we built the entire

00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:18.806 A:middle
application in Swift.

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:22.216 A:middle
Swift's type safety, performance

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:25.196 A:middle
and advanced features like

00:09:25.196 --> 00:09:27.366 A:middle
protocol extensions let us focus

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:28.756 A:middle
more on the gameplay and worry

00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:30.196 A:middle
less about crashes and

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:31.536 A:middle
mismatched interfaces between

00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:32.136 A:middle
code layers.

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:36.716 A:middle
Those are the iOS technologies

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:37.176 A:middle
we use.

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.026 A:middle
I'll talk about how we use those

00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:40.406 A:middle
as we implemented several of the

00:09:40.406 --> 00:09:41.266 A:middle
features of the game.

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:43.206 A:middle
Establishing the shared

00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:43.996 A:middle
coordinate space.

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:45.366 A:middle
Networking.

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:48.546 A:middle
Physics. Asset important and

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:48.896 A:middle
management.

00:09:49.696 --> 00:09:50.656 A:middle
Flag simulation.

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:52.006 A:middle
And the dynamic audio.

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:56.226 A:middle
We'll start by talking about

00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:57.556 A:middle
setting up a shared coordinate

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:58.036 A:middle
space.

00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.926 A:middle
The key in the experience is
