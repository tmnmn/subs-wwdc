00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:00.816 A:middle
actions to talk about how we

00:29:00.816 --> 00:29:03.726 A:middle
apply BitStream to do this.

00:29:03.866 --> 00:29:05.886 A:middle
For regular codable, if you're

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:07.636 A:middle
doing your own serialization,

00:29:07.636 --> 00:29:09.606 A:middle
you specify encoding keys for

00:29:09.606 --> 00:29:10.896 A:middle
enums for the different cases in

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:11.246 A:middle
the enum.

00:29:12.106 --> 00:29:13.766 A:middle
For BitStream, we used integer

00:29:13.766 --> 00:29:15.496 A:middle
values for this rather than

00:29:15.706 --> 00:29:16.746 A:middle
string values.

00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:19.926 A:middle
And then in our encoding method,

00:29:20.426 --> 00:29:22.486 A:middle
we're able to then append that

00:29:22.486 --> 00:29:24.326 A:middle
value first followed by the data

00:29:24.326 --> 00:29:26.346 A:middle
structure associated with that

00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:27.426 A:middle
case of the enum.

00:29:27.916 --> 00:29:29.416 A:middle
Now, if you look at this code

00:29:29.416 --> 00:29:30.706 A:middle
though, there's kind of a pit

00:29:30.706 --> 00:29:31.096 A:middle
fall here.

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:33.646 A:middle
We know that this one has, this

00:29:33.766 --> 00:29:36.466 A:middle
case has three different cases.

00:29:37.256 --> 00:29:38.746 A:middle
And so we only need two bits to

00:29:38.746 --> 00:29:39.766 A:middle
encode it.

00:29:40.376 --> 00:29:42.326 A:middle
But what happens when we add

00:29:42.506 --> 00:29:44.236 A:middle
another case, 4 bits with 4

00:29:44.236 --> 00:29:45.366 A:middle
cases, we'll still find.

00:29:45.806 --> 00:29:47.506 A:middle
We add that fifth case and now

00:29:47.506 --> 00:29:49.676 A:middle
we need to go through and change

00:29:49.676 --> 00:29:51.416 A:middle
that so that every time we do

00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:52.716 A:middle
this, we're using three bits

00:29:52.716 --> 00:29:53.336 A:middle
instead of two.

00:29:54.086 --> 00:29:55.486 A:middle
Now, that's kind of tedious.

00:29:55.486 --> 00:29:56.266 A:middle
This code's a little bit

00:29:56.266 --> 00:29:58.286 A:middle
repetitive and, you know,

00:29:58.416 --> 00:29:59.366 A:middle
there's stuff that could go

00:29:59.366 --> 00:29:59.726 A:middle
wrong there.

00:29:59.726 --> 00:30:00.996 A:middle
We really, if we don't remember
