00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:00.776 A:middle
text will be bold.

00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:02.646 A:middle
Let's take a look at this

00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:03.036 A:middle
rendered.

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:07.136 A:middle
You can see that red and blue

00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:08.096 A:middle
are italicized.

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:11.196 A:middle
Markup is in Code Font and fun

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:11.846 A:middle
is in bold.

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.616 A:middle
Let's take a look at using lists

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:16.346 A:middle
in markup.

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:18.966 A:middle
If a markup comment starts with

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.446 A:middle
a number followed by a period,

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.306 A:middle
it will create an item in a

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.406 A:middle
numbered list.

00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:25.966 A:middle
In this example, I've added the

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:27.816 A:middle
lines of my poem to a numbered

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:29.466 A:middle
list.

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:30.536 A:middle
Here you can see the lines of my

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:32.336 A:middle
poem rendered in a number list,

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:34.906 A:middle
each line representing an item

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:37.206 A:middle
in a numbered list.

00:06:37.486 --> 00:06:38.866 A:middle
You can also create a bullet to

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:39.786 A:middle
list in markup.

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.536 A:middle
A bulleted list is like a number

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.996 A:middle
list except each line starts

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.286 A:middle
with an asterisks instead of a

00:06:45.286 --> 00:06:45.616 A:middle
number.

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:49.056 A:middle
This is how my poem in rendered

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:51.076 A:middle
in a bulleted list with each

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:52.516 A:middle
line in my poem represented as a

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:54.276 A:middle
bulleted item in a bulletin

00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:54.446 A:middle
list.

00:06:57.076 --> 00:06:58.846 A:middle
Markup can also contain links.

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:01.456 A:middle
In this example I've created a
