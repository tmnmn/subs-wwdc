00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
visible so you don't have to

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:01.386 A:middle
handle import statements.

00:09:02.456 --> 00:09:03.576 A:middle
Since these are compiled as

00:09:03.616 --> 00:09:05.536 A:middle
separate modules, you can use

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:07.486 A:middle
access control to control what

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.446 A:middle
is exported from your axillary

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:09.996 A:middle
sources.

00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:13.196 A:middle
Anything you want to use as your

00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:14.856 A:middle
main playground source should be

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:15.696 A:middle
marked as Public.

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:18.246 A:middle
A great example of things to put

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
into the sources folder is

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:22.546 A:middle
helper code such as classes or

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:24.476 A:middle
extensions that are outside of

00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:25.316 A:middle
the main playground.

00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:30.076 A:middle
Playgrounds can also contain

00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.206 A:middle
other resources.

00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:33.786 A:middle
Resources are any other file

00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:34.886 A:middle
that you'd like to use in your

00:09:34.886 --> 00:09:36.076 A:middle
playground such as images,

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.356 A:middle
audio, video, storyboards, and

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:38.806 A:middle
ZIPs.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:42.476 A:middle
Just like sources, there's a

00:09:42.476 --> 00:09:44.016 A:middle
resources folder at the top

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.306 A:middle
level of the playground as well

00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:46.336 A:middle
as for each page.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.946 A:middle
You can use these resources that

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.176 A:middle
you've added to your playground

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
both in your markup and code.

00:09:54.716 --> 00:09:56.346 A:middle
Similar to how you create a link

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:57.796 A:middle
in your playground, you can use

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:00.276 A:middle
this highlighted syntax to imbed
