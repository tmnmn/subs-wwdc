00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:03.336 A:middle
Now let me show you a short

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:04.536 A:middle
snippet that demonstrates how to

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:05.506 A:middle
show Live View.

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:07.946 A:middle
First you need to import

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:08.806 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport.

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:11.836 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport is a framework

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:13.626 A:middle
provided by Xcode to allow

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.796 A:middle
playgrounds to interact with

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:16.896 A:middle
Xcode, including support for

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:17.726 A:middle
showing live views.

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:20.086 A:middle
You import this playground

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:21.656 A:middle
support framework so you can use

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:22.056 A:middle
its API.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:24.546 A:middle
Once you've created a

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:25.896 A:middle
viewController using the

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:27.926 A:middle
standard UIKit or AppKit APIs,

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:29.616 A:middle
you need to hand it over to the

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:30.876 A:middle
PlaygroundSupport framework.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.266 A:middle
You do this by setting the Live

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
View property of the current

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.016 A:middle
playground page to your

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:36.666 A:middle
viewController.

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:38.996 A:middle
This signals to Xcode that it

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:40.126 A:middle
should show your viewController

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:41.546 A:middle
in the assistant editor.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.736 A:middle
To give your playgrounds an

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.316 A:middle
extra bit of polish, you can

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:47.776 A:middle
include some markup text.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.626 A:middle
It is especially great when

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:50.446 A:middle
you're making a playground to

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:50.986 A:middle
share with others.

00:03:52.146 --> 00:03:53.476 A:middle
With markup you can include

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.196 A:middle
stylized text, images, and video

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:56.946 A:middle
in your playground.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:03:59.296 A:middle
Now let's take a quick

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
walkthrough what is possible
