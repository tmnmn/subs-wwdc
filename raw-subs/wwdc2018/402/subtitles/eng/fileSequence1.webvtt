00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:01.386 A:middle
fundamentals, a brief overview

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:03.236 A:middle
of playgrounds, markup, and

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:04.286 A:middle
imbedded resources.

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.636 A:middle
Then we'll show you how to run

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:08.016 A:middle
step-by-step in a playground.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:10.226 A:middle
We'll discuss tips to give you

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:11.826 A:middle
more control of your code

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:12.586 A:middle
execution.

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:15.456 A:middle
Lastly we'll finish with

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.426 A:middle
advanced techniques including

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:18.636 A:middle
the wonderful world of Custom

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:19.926 A:middle
Playground Display Convertible.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:22.146 A:middle
We will use this protocol to

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:23.856 A:middle
customize your inline results.

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.886 A:middle
We will also discuss how to use

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.516 A:middle
workspaces to exercise code in

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:30.406 A:middle
your frameworks.

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
Playgrounds provides an

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.026 A:middle
interactive place to explore

00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:36.416 A:middle
Swift, create learning

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:37.336 A:middle
environments or others, and

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:40.516 A:middle
prototype parts of your app.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:41.776 A:middle
Let's get started with a quick

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
tour of Playgrounds in Xcode.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:47.916 A:middle
When you first open a

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.616 A:middle
playground, Xcode shows you the

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:50.516 A:middle
standard editor.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:52.736 A:middle
This is the basic editor mode

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.646 A:middle
you use in Xcode with a couple

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:55.286 A:middle
additions.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:57.726 A:middle
What is unique about this editor

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.426 A:middle
when you're in a playground is

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
the result sidebar on the right
