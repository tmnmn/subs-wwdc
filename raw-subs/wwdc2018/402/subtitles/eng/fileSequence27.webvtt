00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:03.336 A:middle
This is still text though and

00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:06.056 A:middle
there are times when text isn't

00:27:06.056 --> 00:27:07.066 A:middle
going to be enough and you would

00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:08.456 A:middle
like to return something

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:10.446 A:middle
graphical, maybe a picture.

00:27:12.136 --> 00:27:14.656 A:middle
The way to control what you

00:27:14.656 --> 00:27:17.706 A:middle
return is to implement Custom

00:27:17.706 --> 00:27:19.226 A:middle
Playground Display Convertible,

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:22.936 A:middle
a new protocol introduced in

00:27:22.936 --> 00:27:26.506 A:middle
Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1.

00:27:27.256 --> 00:27:29.436 A:middle
It replaces Custom Playground

00:27:29.436 --> 00:27:31.046 A:middle
Quick Lookable, which was

00:27:31.046 --> 00:27:32.686 A:middle
deprecated in the same versions.

00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:36.756 A:middle
Let's take a look at conformance

00:27:36.756 --> 00:27:39.016 A:middle
right now.

00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:41.926 A:middle
You can see here that conforming

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:44.356 A:middle
involves only returning one

00:27:44.356 --> 00:27:45.426 A:middle
property, Playground

00:27:45.426 --> 00:27:45.856 A:middle
Description.

00:27:46.546 --> 00:27:47.946 A:middle
Playground Description is of

00:27:47.946 --> 00:27:49.916 A:middle
type Any, which means you can

00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:51.456 A:middle
return anything that you feel

00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:54.686 A:middle
best describes your value.

00:27:56.496 --> 00:27:58.256 A:middle
Now, there are certain types

00:27:58.256 --> 00:27:59.416 A:middle
that have specialized

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
representations already and
