00:16:54.516 --> 00:17:00.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.415 A:middle
So we started off with one game,

00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
I'm going to move on to another.

00:17:08.296 --> 00:17:10.336 A:middle
This is the game of Tic-tac-toe.

00:17:11.306 --> 00:17:12.816 A:middle
I've already been working on

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:13.556 A:middle
this a little while.

00:17:14.086 --> 00:17:16.185 A:middle
I've built the game engine and

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:17.486 A:middle
I've made a first version of the

00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:17.685 A:middle
UI.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:19.856 A:middle
I've moved all of that code

00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:21.406 A:middle
aside into the auxiliary

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:22.066 A:middle
sources.

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:23.836 A:middle
This gets it out of our way and

00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:25.246 A:middle
allows us to focus on the next

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:27.185 A:middle
steps -- actually playing the

00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:28.996 A:middle
game and refining the UI a

00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:29.356 A:middle
little.

00:17:30.986 --> 00:17:32.176 A:middle
I'm also going to use a live

00:17:32.226 --> 00:17:33.976 A:middle
view, but first let's look back

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:36.366 A:middle
at the blue control over the

00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:37.106 A:middle
line numbers.

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:38.876 A:middle
You can see that it tracks the

00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:39.556 A:middle
mouse pointer.

00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:43.696 A:middle
So let's get started by loading

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:44.256 A:middle
the game board.

00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:46.626 A:middle
Let's rotate it so we can see

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:48.436 A:middle
it.

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:50.406 A:middle
This is the Tic-tac-toe game

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:50.686 A:middle
board.

00:17:51.146 --> 00:17:52.356 A:middle
You can see I've been able to

00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:53.586 A:middle
execute the first half of the

00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:55.356 A:middle
playground and I've still got

00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:56.306 A:middle
some lines left in the

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:57.356 A:middle
playground to execute.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:00.116 A:middle
These include my first move.
