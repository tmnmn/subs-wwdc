00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:02.436 A:middle
just learning about new Apple

00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:05.316 A:middle
APIs or an experienced

00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:07.846 A:middle
programmer trying to sketch out

00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:09.806 A:middle
the bones of their next great

00:22:10.616 --> 00:22:13.426 A:middle
app, the next time you have a

00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:16.056 A:middle
coding inspiration we invite you

00:22:16.056 --> 00:22:17.536 A:middle
to get started with a

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.186 A:middle
playground.

00:22:18.656 --> 00:22:23.126 A:middle
Just in case you're still

00:22:23.126 --> 00:22:25.536 A:middle
looking for ideas I've got three

00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:26.086 A:middle
right here.

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:29.446 A:middle
Number one if you're creating

00:22:29.446 --> 00:22:31.696 A:middle
your own API, one of the best

00:22:31.696 --> 00:22:33.716 A:middle
ways to showcase it is to create

00:22:33.716 --> 00:22:35.976 A:middle
a follow along tutorial for your

00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:36.146 A:middle
API.

00:22:36.366 --> 00:22:37.956 A:middle
Users can execute the code

00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:40.006 A:middle
step-by-step and see in real

00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:42.586 A:middle
time what it does.

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:45.566 A:middle
Number two you can download and

00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:47.176 A:middle
explore some publicly available

00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:48.976 A:middle
data using the playground

00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:52.016 A:middle
step-by-step to drill down into

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:52.586 A:middle
your data.

00:22:53.816 --> 00:22:55.806 A:middle
You could get this from maps,

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:57.586 A:middle
from local government, or

00:22:57.586 --> 00:22:59.326 A:middle
perhaps a class project.
