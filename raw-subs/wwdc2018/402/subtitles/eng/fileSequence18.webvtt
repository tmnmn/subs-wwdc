00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:00.116 A:middle
These include my first move.

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:02.566 A:middle
Let's run that.

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:03.946 A:middle
There we go.

00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:05.576 A:middle
So you can see we're going to be

00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:08.266 A:middle
playing the game in code and

00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:09.666 A:middle
viewing the results with the

00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:10.306 A:middle
live view.

00:18:11.386 --> 00:18:12.706 A:middle
Let's let the computer play and

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:13.686 A:middle
have a turn.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:18.956 A:middle
Few, that's great.

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:20.406 A:middle
The computer player is

00:18:20.406 --> 00:18:21.306 A:middle
completely random.

00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:23.116 A:middle
So it's just possible it's going

00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:23.876 A:middle
to beat me today.

00:18:24.516 --> 00:18:28.066 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.916 A:middle
So I've shown you how we can

00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:31.046 A:middle
execute some of the lines of

00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:33.066 A:middle
code and then step-by-step

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:34.786 A:middle
execute lines of code which are

00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:35.546 A:middle
already present in the

00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:36.076 A:middle
playground.

00:18:36.076 --> 00:18:37.996 A:middle
But we can do more than that.

00:18:37.996 --> 00:18:39.706 A:middle
It's always safe to add new code

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:40.706 A:middle
at the end of a playground.

00:18:41.126 --> 00:18:41.976 A:middle
So let's make another move.

00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:52.246 A:middle
There we go.

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:54.626 A:middle
Now, I can click the Play button

00:18:55.216 --> 00:19:00.026 A:middle
to execute this line of code and
