00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:28.406 A:middle

I want to ask you a question.

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:48.576 A:middle
Have you ever woken up with a

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:50.916 A:middle
great coding idea but then

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.556 A:middle
struggled to set it down before

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:53.536 A:middle
you reach your code editor?

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:56.026 A:middle
Perhaps it's your inbox that

00:11:56.026 --> 00:11:58.036 A:middle
gets in the way or perhaps you

00:11:58.036 --> 00:11:59.736 A:middle
haven't yet set up your project

00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
within Xcode.
