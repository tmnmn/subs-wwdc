00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.446 A:middle
representations already and

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:04.296 A:middle
those are provided by Apple.

00:28:04.506 --> 00:28:06.856 A:middle
Here's a list of the types with

00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:08.716 A:middle
specialized representations as

00:28:08.716 --> 00:28:11.786 A:middle
of Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:14.676 A:middle
The types on the left have a

00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:15.936 A:middle
particularly textual

00:28:15.936 --> 00:28:16.766 A:middle
representation.

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:19.456 A:middle
The types on the right have a

00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:20.646 A:middle
graphical representation.

00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:23.586 A:middle
I invite you to try each of

00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:25.686 A:middle
these and decide which best

00:28:25.686 --> 00:28:27.326 A:middle
represents your value in a

00:28:27.326 --> 00:28:27.926 A:middle
playground.

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:32.486 A:middle
Once you've done this you'll

00:28:32.486 --> 00:28:34.196 A:middle
want to ship all of your types,

00:28:34.196 --> 00:28:35.636 A:middle
and your values, and your API to

00:28:35.726 --> 00:28:36.486 A:middle
your users.

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:40.366 A:middle
I'm going to show you how to

00:28:41.216 --> 00:28:42.646 A:middle
import your own custom

00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:44.256 A:middle
frameworks into playgrounds

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:46.026 A:middle
alongside Apple frameworks.

00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:50.616 A:middle
Typically, when you build a

00:28:50.616 --> 00:28:52.846 A:middle
single framework in a project,

00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:55.016 A:middle
that framework will end up in

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:56.386 A:middle
the Built Products Directory.

00:28:58.296 --> 00:29:00.076 A:middle
When you want to import it into
