00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.266 A:middle
You're going to go to File,

00:31:01.396 --> 00:31:05.666 A:middle
Project Settings, and then we're

00:31:05.666 --> 00:31:07.966 A:middle
going to click the Advanced

00:31:09.536 --> 00:31:09.866 A:middle
button.

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:12.006 A:middle
On this screen in light gray

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.356 A:middle
we'll see that there is a

00:31:13.606 --> 00:31:16.986 A:middle
Products destination.

00:31:17.516 --> 00:31:19.086 A:middle
You'll click on that and that

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:20.516 A:middle
should bring you directly to the

00:31:20.516 --> 00:31:22.456 A:middle
Built Products Director for the

00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:23.966 A:middle
project that you have open.

00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:28.006 A:middle
This is what that should look

00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:28.856 A:middle
like in Finder.

00:31:30.336 --> 00:31:32.126 A:middle
Now let's see all of this

00:31:32.596 --> 00:31:33.796 A:middle
brought together in a demo.

00:31:35.516 --> 00:31:40.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:43.476 --> 00:31:45.576 A:middle
Now those of you who know me

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.986 A:middle
know that I have a pretty

00:31:48.986 --> 00:31:50.236 A:middle
enduring interest in music.

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:53.136 A:middle
I'm actually so interested in

00:31:53.136 --> 00:31:55.926 A:middle
music that I have found this new

00:31:55.926 --> 00:31:57.646 A:middle
notation, well new to me

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.336 A:middle
notation, called Helmholtz

00:31:59.336 --> 00:31:59.806 A:middle
notation.

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:01.916 A:middle
