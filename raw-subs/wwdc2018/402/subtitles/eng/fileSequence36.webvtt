00:35:59.016 --> 00:36:01.306 A:middle
have only seen a piano, so I

00:36:01.306 --> 00:36:03.206 A:middle
have a little snippet here that

00:36:04.836 --> 00:36:08.906 A:middle
quickly creates a view in

00:36:08.906 --> 00:36:09.876 A:middle
playground description,

00:36:10.296 --> 00:36:12.116 A:middle
configures it, and actually I

00:36:12.216 --> 00:36:13.656 A:middle
have one more line that I wanted

00:36:13.656 --> 00:36:14.526 A:middle
to write on stage.

00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:19.336 A:middle
Custom text equals description.

00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:22.476 A:middle
And after I configure my view

00:36:22.866 --> 00:36:24.166 A:middle
I'm going to return it.

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:25.076 A:middle
Simple as that.

00:36:25.826 --> 00:36:27.086 A:middle
Made much simpler by the fact

00:36:27.086 --> 00:36:27.966 A:middle
that I happen to have a

00:36:27.966 --> 00:36:29.336 A:middle
framework already on hand.

00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:31.826 A:middle
Now, I want to run this line,

00:36:31.826 --> 00:36:34.426 A:middle
line 4 again, but with my

00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:35.036 A:middle
conformant.

00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:36.736 A:middle
So I'm going to reset this

00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:38.406 A:middle
playground by clicking on the

00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:39.976 A:middle
stop button down here.

00:36:44.486 --> 00:36:45.976 A:middle
And then I'm going to rerun this

00:36:45.976 --> 00:36:49.516 A:middle
entire playground after I add my

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:49.976 A:middle
inline result.

00:36:54.126 --> 00:36:55.056 A:middle
And you can see here --

00:36:56.516 --> 00:37:02.566 A:middle
