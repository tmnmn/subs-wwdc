either of the frameworks.

00:34:01.136 --> 00:34:03.566 A:middle
So to do that I'm going to

00:34:03.566 --> 00:34:07.776 A:middle
quickly close this, I'm going to

00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:13.806 A:middle
create a brand new workspace by

00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:18.505 A:middle
going to File, New Work Space,

00:34:19.005 --> 00:34:22.206 A:middle
and I'm going to name this

00:34:22.266 --> 00:34:22.686 A:middle

00:34:23.286 --> 00:34:25.815 A:middle
Just put that on the desktop.

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:32.735 A:middle

00:34:32.735 --> 00:34:35.815 A:middle

00:34:36.956 --> 00:34:39.306 A:middle
I'm going to start with

00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:41.996 A:middle
Helmholtz, my framework that I

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:45.565 A:middle
just had open, then File, right

00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:48.505 A:middle
there, Keyboard.

00:34:52.775 --> 00:34:54.315 A:middle
Then I'm going to add a new

00:34:54.315 --> 00:34:56.065 A:middle
playground by going to File,

00:34:56.656 --> 00:34:58.176 A:middle
