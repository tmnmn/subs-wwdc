00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:01.256 A:middle
For types that are no optimized

00:26:01.256 --> 00:26:03.466 A:middle
for playgrounds there are two

00:26:03.466 --> 00:26:04.716 A:middle
ways that playgrounds will

00:26:04.716 --> 00:26:05.976 A:middle
generate this description.

00:26:06.956 --> 00:26:09.296 A:middle
For types that do not conform to

00:26:09.296 --> 00:26:12.236 A:middle
Custom String Convertible, we

00:26:13.026 --> 00:26:14.666 A:middle
will create a structured

00:26:14.666 --> 00:26:16.686 A:middle
representation using the Swift

00:26:16.686 --> 00:26:16.856 A:middle
type.

00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:19.436 A:middle
For types that do conform to

00:26:19.436 --> 00:26:20.746 A:middle
Custom String Convertible, we

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.256 A:middle
will use the result of calling

00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:23.806 A:middle
descriptions.

00:26:24.276 --> 00:26:27.906 A:middle
When this isn't enough sometimes

00:26:27.906 --> 00:26:31.716 A:middle
your users will tap on the Quick

00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.236 A:middle
Look button on the right-hand

00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:33.576 A:middle
side.

00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:40.026 A:middle
They will also tap or click on

00:26:40.026 --> 00:26:42.646 A:middle
the Inline Results button.

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:47.636 A:middle
When they do this a custom

00:26:47.636 --> 00:26:49.316 A:middle
representation will show up.

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.556 A:middle
Often a textual representation.

00:26:52.676 --> 00:26:54.566 A:middle
And for many types this is

00:26:54.566 --> 00:26:56.106 A:middle
perfectly enough but sometimes

00:26:56.206 --> 00:26:58.896 A:middle
maybe you would like to return a

00:26:58.896 --> 00:26:59.236 A:middle
number.
