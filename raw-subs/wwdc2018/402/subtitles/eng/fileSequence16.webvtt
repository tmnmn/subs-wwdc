00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
I've written the rules as a

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.746 A:middle
simple function check, which

00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:04.766 A:middle
tells us if we've won.

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:06.836 A:middle
I've also written a computer

00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:08.336 A:middle
player, which simply makes one

00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:09.516 A:middle
of the moves at random.

00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:13.246 A:middle
By executing step-by-step we can

00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:14.736 A:middle
execute line six where the

00:16:14.736 --> 00:16:16.786 A:middle
computer player plays and see

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:18.256 A:middle
what the result is before making

00:16:18.256 --> 00:16:18.746 A:middle
our move.

00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:20.956 A:middle
In this case the computer player

00:16:20.956 --> 00:16:22.756 A:middle
has played "rock" and we've

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:23.716 A:middle
played "paper".

00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:26.546 A:middle
Paper beats rock and we win the

00:16:26.546 --> 00:16:26.946 A:middle
game.

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:29.316 A:middle
This might sound a little bit

00:16:29.316 --> 00:16:30.756 A:middle
like cheating, but it's an

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.976 A:middle
extremely powerful technique.

00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:37.246 A:middle
It's an extremely powerful

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.046 A:middle
technique when you're trying to

00:16:39.046 --> 00:16:41.056 A:middle
learn a new and unfamiliar API

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:43.416 A:middle
or exploring a data structure

00:16:43.576 --> 00:16:44.996 A:middle
whose types and values you don't

00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:45.456 A:middle
yet know.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.116 A:middle
So that's a very simple example.

00:16:48.756 --> 00:16:49.506 A:middle
Now we're going to look at

00:16:49.506 --> 00:16:50.536 A:middle
something a little bit more

00:16:50.536 --> 00:16:51.646 A:middle
magical with a demo.

00:16:54.516 --> 00:17:00.500 A:middle
