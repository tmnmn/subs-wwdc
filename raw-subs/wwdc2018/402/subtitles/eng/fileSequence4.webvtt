00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.686 A:middle
walkthrough what is possible

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:01.336 A:middle
with markup.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.356 A:middle
Here I've included some markup

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:06.736 A:middle
comments with text for a poem

00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:07.346 A:middle
I'm writing.

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:09.436 A:middle
A markup comment is like a

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:11.326 A:middle
regular comment but with a colon

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:12.526 A:middle
after the forward slashes.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.516 A:middle
The rest of the comment is then

00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:17.786 A:middle
treated as markup text.

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:19.576 A:middle
If you have multiple lines of

00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:21.375 A:middle
comments next to each other they

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:23.536 A:middle
form one block of markup text.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.166 A:middle
You can also use multiline

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.806 A:middle
comments by putting a colon

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.096 A:middle
after the first asterisks.

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.936 A:middle
Here's our markup in Xcode now.

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.236 A:middle
It is showing the raw markup of

00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:36.996 A:middle
the poem I wrote.

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.766 A:middle
To show it in its rendered form,

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:41.526 A:middle
select the button in the top

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:42.586 A:middle
right corner of the window,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:44.696 A:middle
which shows Xcode's Inspector.

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:47.936 A:middle
Then select Render Documentation

00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:49.316 A:middle
under Playground Settings.

00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.396 A:middle
The lines in my poem are now

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:52.876 A:middle
rendered.

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.746 A:middle
Other interesting things you can

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:57.866 A:middle
do with the markup are adding

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.446 A:middle
headings to a Playground peach.
