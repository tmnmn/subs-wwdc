00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:01.236 A:middle
readme's, tutorials, and general

00:25:01.236 --> 00:25:02.856 A:middle
API documentation.

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:06.556 A:middle
One of the ways that they can do

00:25:06.556 --> 00:25:08.686 A:middle
this is by, as Alex said,

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:09.926 A:middle
providing your own

00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.926 A:middle
representation in playgrounds.

00:25:12.436 --> 00:25:14.116 A:middle
I'm going to cover all of these

00:25:14.116 --> 00:25:16.656 A:middle
things starting with Custom

00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:18.236 A:middle
Playground Display Convertible,

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.636 A:middle
which will allow you to provide

00:25:20.716 --> 00:25:22.906 A:middle
custom representations of your

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:25.956 A:middle
types in playgrounds so that

00:25:25.956 --> 00:25:27.776 A:middle
users can get a nice summary.

00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:31.016 A:middle
I'll follow that up with how to

00:25:31.016 --> 00:25:33.646 A:middle
import your frameworks into

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:34.766 A:middle
playgrounds.

00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:37.476 A:middle
And finally, I'll cover a little

00:25:37.476 --> 00:25:38.746 A:middle
bit of troubleshooting tips for

00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:40.156 A:middle
when things don't go exactly as

00:25:40.156 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
you'd expect.

00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:45.426 A:middle
Let's start with Playground

00:25:45.646 --> 00:25:46.526 A:middle
Display Convertible.

00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:50.816 A:middle
So as you know, when a user

00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:54.256 A:middle
types in a line of code values

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:56.726 A:middle
show up on the right hand side

00:25:56.726 --> 00:25:57.736 A:middle
in the result sidebar.

00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:01.256 A:middle
For types that are no optimized
