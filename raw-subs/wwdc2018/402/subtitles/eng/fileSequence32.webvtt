00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:01.916 A:middle
And I feel that many, many

00:32:01.916 --> 00:32:03.036 A:middle
people should know about this

00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:03.826 A:middle
and it should be much more

00:32:03.826 --> 00:32:04.516 A:middle
widely used.

00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:06.836 A:middle
So I've created a framework to

00:32:06.836 --> 00:32:08.376 A:middle
share with other developers so

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:09.296 A:middle
that they can use it in their

00:32:09.296 --> 00:32:09.636 A:middle
code.

00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:11.446 A:middle
You can see here that I've

00:32:11.446 --> 00:32:13.796 A:middle
included a playground and I've

00:32:14.286 --> 00:32:17.886 A:middle
also, as the result of extensive

00:32:18.096 --> 00:32:20.366 A:middle
research on Wikipedia written up

00:32:20.486 --> 00:32:22.846 A:middle
a little playground that

00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:23.946 A:middle
describes the notation.

00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:26.746 A:middle
Follow it, followed by a few

00:32:26.746 --> 00:32:28.376 A:middle
values so that we can see the

00:32:28.376 --> 00:32:30.746 A:middle
results on the right hand side

00:32:31.586 --> 00:32:32.486 A:middle
with the notation.

00:32:35.326 --> 00:32:36.946 A:middle
If I render this documentation

00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:41.476 A:middle
this will all end up in Pros

00:32:41.476 --> 00:32:43.136 A:middle
with the links highlighted in

00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:45.116 A:middle
blue just as Tibet spoke of.

00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:51.026 A:middle
And before I build, or before I

00:32:51.026 --> 00:32:55.126 A:middle
run I'm going to build.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:58.716 A:middle
Then let's run our playground,

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:00.276 A:middle
yay.
