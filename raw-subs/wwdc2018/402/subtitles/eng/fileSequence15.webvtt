00:14:57.836 --> 00:15:00.226 A:middle
Firstly, executing just one more

00:15:00.226 --> 00:15:01.026 A:middle
line is fast.

00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:02.946 A:middle
It's way faster than restarting

00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:04.146 A:middle
a playground and waiting for it

00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:05.526 A:middle
to catch up with your thoughts.

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:08.496 A:middle
Secondly, it allows you to

00:15:08.496 --> 00:15:09.886 A:middle
respond to live data.

00:15:10.456 --> 00:15:12.796 A:middle
Write a line of code, execute

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:14.476 A:middle
it, see what the results are,

00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:15.596 A:middle
and this should lead you

00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:16.986 A:middle
naturally to the next line of

00:15:16.986 --> 00:15:17.606 A:middle
code to write.

00:15:18.796 --> 00:15:20.736 A:middle
And thirdly rerunning a

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:22.486 A:middle
playground every time can give

00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:23.846 A:middle
you different values every time.

00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:25.836 A:middle
This can happen, for instance,

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.186 A:middle
if you're accessing a network

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:29.206 A:middle
resource or you're generating

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:30.006 A:middle
random numbers.

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:32.706 A:middle
By executing step-by-step your

00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:34.416 A:middle
data model stays stable and

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:35.396 A:middle
easier to understand.

00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:38.406 A:middle
So let's take a look at a simple

00:15:38.406 --> 00:15:39.806 A:middle
example that you can try

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:40.516 A:middle
yourselves.

00:15:42.866 --> 00:15:43.766 A:middle
I like games.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.486 A:middle
I like card games and board

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.676 A:middle
games and computer games.

00:15:46.856 --> 00:15:48.786 A:middle
I even like writing games.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.016 A:middle
Now I'm not too hot at it so I

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.286 A:middle
like to keep my games small.

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.906 A:middle
This is a really small game.

00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:55.486 A:middle
It's the game of roshambo.

00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:57.736 A:middle
It's the schoolyard game of

00:15:57.736 --> 00:15:59.656 A:middle
rock, paper, scissors.
