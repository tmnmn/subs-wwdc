00:18:55.216 --> 00:19:00.026 A:middle
to execute this line of code and

00:19:00.026 --> 00:19:00.856 A:middle
I think now we'll let the

00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:01.746 A:middle
computer have another go.

00:19:07.196 --> 00:19:07.976 A:middle
That's great.

00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:12.626 A:middle
[ Laughing ]

00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:14.166 A:middle
You should notice a couple of

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:14.676 A:middle
things here.

00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:17.686 A:middle
Number one, in the beginning the

00:19:17.686 --> 00:19:18.616 A:middle
board was flat.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.106 A:middle
I had to rotate it so it was in

00:19:20.106 --> 00:19:21.236 A:middle
a position where we could view

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:21.436 A:middle
it.

00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:24.906 A:middle
As we execute more lines of

00:19:24.946 --> 00:19:26.846 A:middle
code, it doesn't rotate back to

00:19:26.846 --> 00:19:27.896 A:middle
its original position.

00:19:28.356 --> 00:19:29.846 A:middle
This is pretty good because I

00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:31.366 A:middle
could write lines of code to

00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:32.456 A:middle
rotate it to the correct

00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:33.976 A:middle
position, but this would involve

00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:34.506 A:middle
something called [inaudible],

00:19:34.556 --> 00:19:36.316 A:middle
and I don't think I'm quite

00:19:36.316 --> 00:19:37.866 A:middle
ready to learn that yet.

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:41.086 A:middle
The second reason it's good is

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:42.836 A:middle
because if the computer player

00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:45.196 A:middle
was allowed to play again, every

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:47.456 A:middle
time we executed new code it

00:19:47.456 --> 00:19:48.846 A:middle
would effectively get a do-over,

00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:50.036 A:middle
which would be a little unfair.

00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:52.376 A:middle
Let's finish this up.

00:19:52.426 --> 00:19:53.656 A:middle
I think I can take the game home

00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:55.000 A:middle
from here.
