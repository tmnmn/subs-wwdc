00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:00.366 A:middle
There's also a great keyboard

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:02.656 A:middle
shortcut, Shift Return.

00:14:03.436 --> 00:14:04.476 A:middle
This is just like pressing

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:05.806 A:middle
Return at the end of typing a

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:07.736 A:middle
line of code, but it also means

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.726 A:middle
execute this line, and it move

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:10.966 A:middle
the cursor to the next line

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:14.036 A:middle
ready to write some more code.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.956 A:middle
Blue code also has a second

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:17.686 A:middle
interpretation.

00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:19.916 A:middle
It means code that it's safe to

00:14:20.116 --> 00:14:21.986 A:middle
edit without resetting your

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:22.546 A:middle
playground.

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:24.456 A:middle
Why is this important?

00:14:25.086 --> 00:14:26.916 A:middle
If you edit code above the blue

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:29.736 A:middle
line this is modifying code that

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:31.066 A:middle
you've already executed.

00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:32.706 A:middle
So you'll have to resent your

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.556 A:middle
playground to take account of

00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:35.346 A:middle
your changes.

00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:37.636 A:middle
When you edit code above the

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:39.956 A:middle
blue line, the playground resets

00:14:40.036 --> 00:14:40.756 A:middle
automatically.

00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:46.316 A:middle
Sometimes you'll need to reset

00:14:46.316 --> 00:14:47.786 A:middle
your playground manually and you

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.526 A:middle
can do this using the stop

00:14:49.526 --> 00:14:51.376 A:middle
button in the Debug bar at the

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:52.266 A:middle
bottom of the screen.

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.586 A:middle
So why run in a step-by-step

00:14:55.586 --> 00:14:56.086 A:middle
fashion?

00:14:56.086 --> 00:14:57.326 A:middle
Why have we added this feature?

00:14:57.836 --> 00:15:00.226 A:middle
Firstly, executing just one more
