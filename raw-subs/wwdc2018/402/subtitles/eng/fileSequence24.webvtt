00:23:59.946 --> 00:24:02.806 A:middle
API, which you've learned about

00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:04.606 A:middle
at this WWDC.

00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.436 A:middle
You don't just have to use

00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:07.156 A:middle
Apple's APIs.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.546 A:middle
You can also import your own

00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:11.016 A:middle
frameworks into playgrounds.

00:24:11.346 --> 00:24:12.436 A:middle
And one of the best ways to

00:24:12.436 --> 00:24:14.666 A:middle
showcase this is to create

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.146 A:middle
custom representations of your

00:24:16.146 --> 00:24:18.546 A:middle
data types allowing developers

00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.036 A:middle
to view the most relevant

00:24:20.036 --> 00:24:21.556 A:middle
information at a glance.

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:24.216 A:middle
And to talk more about these two

00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:26.166 A:middle
advanced concepts, I'd like to

00:24:26.166 --> 00:24:27.616 A:middle
invite TJ to the stage.

00:24:29.516 --> 00:24:36.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:37.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Alex.

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.476 A:middle
My name is TJ Usiyan and I'm an

00:24:40.476 --> 00:24:41.286 A:middle
Xcode Engineer.

00:24:42.126 --> 00:24:43.546 A:middle
By the time I finish my section,

00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:45.096 A:middle
I'm sure that all of you will

00:24:45.096 --> 00:24:47.216 A:middle
agree that every librarian

00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:49.266 A:middle
framework that you ship will and

00:24:49.266 --> 00:24:50.916 A:middle
can be improved with the

00:24:50.916 --> 00:24:52.166 A:middle
addition of a playground.

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.976 A:middle
Playgrounds provide a richer

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:58.616 A:middle
experience when providing

00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:01.236 A:middle
readme's, tutorials, and general
