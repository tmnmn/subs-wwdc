00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:01.356 A:middle
You can use headings to create

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:02.676 A:middle
structure in your playground.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:04.476 A:middle
You can use number signs to

00:05:04.476 --> 00:05:06.146 A:middle
supply up to three levels of

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:06.566 A:middle
heading.

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:10.136 A:middle
In this example the title of my

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:12.206 A:middle
poem "Roses are Red" as a first

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:15.006 A:middle
level heading, the subtitle, "An

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:16.706 A:middle
Ode to Markup" as a second level

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:19.266 A:middle
heading, and the byline as a

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:20.156 A:middle
third level heading.

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
Remember to add at least one

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.006 A:middle
space between the number sign

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:24.816 A:middle
and the heading string,

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:25.996 A:middle
otherwise you'll have a number

00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:26.906 A:middle
sign connected to your heading

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:27.416 A:middle
when rendered.

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:30.666 A:middle
This is what the headings look

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:31.936 A:middle
like rendered when included with

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:32.916 A:middle
the lines in my poem.

00:05:33.786 --> 00:05:34.876 A:middle
You can see that the first level

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.656 A:middle
heading is largest, followed by

00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:38.226 A:middle
the second level, and then the

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.066 A:middle
third level heading.

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:42.416 A:middle
You can also format the text in

00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:42.956 A:middle
your markup content.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:45.876 A:middle
You can wrap a string of

00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:47.926 A:middle
characters on a single asterisk

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.226 A:middle
on each side to italicize the

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:50.486 A:middle
text between the asterisks.

00:05:51.676 --> 00:05:53.286 A:middle
You can also use backticks to

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.406 A:middle
display text with Code Font.

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:58.156 A:middle
Finally, if you use two

00:05:58.156 --> 00:05:59.836 A:middle
asterisks instead of one the

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:00.776 A:middle
text will be bold.
