00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:00.806 A:middle
within Xcode.

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:03.766 A:middle
Whether you're a beginner just

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:06.026 A:middle
getting started with Apple APIs,

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.316 A:middle
a seasoned engineer with a

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:10.986 A:middle
deadline, or a data scientist

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:12.226 A:middle
building machine learning

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:15.696 A:middle
models, I want to tell you that

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:17.216 A:middle
Xcode playgrounds are the

00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:19.126 A:middle
fastest way to get started

00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.366 A:middle
coding against Apple's APIs.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:27.376 A:middle
In Xcode 10, playgrounds are

00:12:27.376 --> 00:12:28.956 A:middle
faster and more responsive than

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.726 A:middle
ever allowing you to execute

00:12:30.726 --> 00:12:32.346 A:middle
your code in a step-by-step

00:12:32.346 --> 00:12:32.776 A:middle
fashion.

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.376 A:middle
First I'd like to get you

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:36.876 A:middle
familiar with a new UI for doing

00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:36.976 A:middle
this.

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:42.586 A:middle
If you're familiar with

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:44.406 A:middle
playgrounds, your eye should

00:12:44.406 --> 00:12:46.646 A:middle
immediately jump to the blue

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:49.056 A:middle
line over the not line numbers.

00:12:50.676 --> 00:12:52.576 A:middle
There's a new play button which

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:53.436 A:middle
tracks your pointer.

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:57.296 A:middle
A blue line over the line

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:59.706 A:middle
numbers mean these lines are

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
ready to execute and when you
