00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:02.286 A:middle
ready to execute and when you

00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:04.796 A:middle
click the Play button this means

00:13:05.806 --> 00:13:07.466 A:middle
run all of the blue lines up to

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:09.076 A:middle
and including the one with the

00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:09.826 A:middle
play button on it.

00:13:10.226 --> 00:13:11.456 A:middle
Let's see what that looks like.

00:13:13.076 --> 00:13:13.606 A:middle
There we go.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.566 A:middle
You can see just the first three

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:16.696 A:middle
lines of the playground are

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:17.346 A:middle
executed.

00:13:18.126 --> 00:13:19.536 A:middle
The results are visible on the

00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:20.276 A:middle
right-hand side.

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.726 A:middle
You can also see that the play

00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:24.226 A:middle
button has now gone gray.

00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:26.126 A:middle
This indicates that these lines

00:13:26.126 --> 00:13:27.656 A:middle
of code are no longer ready to

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:28.116 A:middle
execute.

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:30.396 A:middle
You just executed them.

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:33.066 A:middle
There's a second reason that

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:34.416 A:middle
they play button might be gray.

00:13:35.046 --> 00:13:36.486 A:middle
This means you're hovering over

00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:37.796 A:middle
some code, which is not a

00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:39.246 A:middle
top-level line of code.

00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:41.736 A:middle
This includes code inside

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:43.636 A:middle
function brackets and inside of

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:44.126 A:middle
fall loop.

00:13:44.876 --> 00:13:46.436 A:middle
If you wish to execute a fall

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:47.966 A:middle
loop you need to move your

00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:50.056 A:middle
pointer to the closing brace

00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:52.236 A:middle
where the play button will go

00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:53.696 A:middle
blue then you'll be able to

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:54.906 A:middle
execute it.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:00.366 A:middle
There's also a great keyboard
