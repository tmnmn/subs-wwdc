00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:08.156 A:middle
Is that the right move?

00:20:08.726 --> 00:20:09.616 A:middle
That's great.

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:16.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:17.386 --> 00:20:18.376 A:middle
You can see the game has

00:20:18.376 --> 00:20:20.126 A:middle
highlighted my winning move by

00:20:20.126 --> 00:20:21.826 A:middle
placing three red circles.

00:20:23.196 --> 00:20:24.276 A:middle
That's not too fancy.

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:25.356 A:middle
I'm looking for something which

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:26.316 A:middle
really makes it feel like a

00:20:26.316 --> 00:20:27.066 A:middle
celebration.

00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:29.126 A:middle
So I've been working on a new

00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:30.146 A:middle
version of the UI.

00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:32.446 A:middle
In a traditional development

00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:33.806 A:middle
environment, you would have to

00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:35.426 A:middle
set up a complex harness to

00:20:35.426 --> 00:20:37.156 A:middle
automatically play you deep into

00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:39.446 A:middle
the game or whatever the API was

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:41.186 A:middle
you were using so that we could

00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:42.556 A:middle
test out something that happened

00:20:43.156 --> 00:20:44.306 A:middle
later on in the program.

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.636 A:middle
But in a playground, because I'm

00:20:46.636 --> 00:20:48.636 A:middle
able to execute step-by-step, I

00:20:48.636 --> 00:20:49.986 A:middle
can play it manually to the end

00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:51.356 A:middle
of the game and then write new

00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:52.916 A:middle
lines of code to update

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.426 A:middle
whatever's going on at that

00:20:54.426 --> 00:20:54.696 A:middle
point.

00:20:55.356 --> 00:20:56.206 A:middle
Let's do that now.
