00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:01.746 A:middle
Now, it asks me for a URL for

00:13:01.746 --> 00:13:03.376 A:middle
the first item to be previewed,

00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:05.846 A:middle
and I respond with the file URL

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:08.316 A:middle
for my app bundle for the model

00:13:08.316 --> 00:13:10.046 A:middle
that was tapped.

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:12.056 A:middle
Finally, it asks me for the view

00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:13.856 A:middle
to use as a source view for the

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:15.356 A:middle
transition animation for when

00:13:15.356 --> 00:13:16.296 A:middle
the preview is presented.

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.666 A:middle
And here, I want a seamless

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:20.276 A:middle
animation from the view that was

00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:21.576 A:middle
tapped to the view that was

00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:22.376 A:middle
going to be presented.

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:24.306 A:middle
And so, I return View #3.

00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:27.366 A:middle
With all that configured, we're

00:13:27.366 --> 00:13:28.606 A:middle
ready to present our preview

00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:30.496 A:middle
controller, and so it's going to

00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:31.776 A:middle
animate and scale up from the

00:13:31.816 --> 00:13:32.486 A:middle
view that was tapped.

00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:35.556 A:middle
And this is what it looks like

00:13:35.556 --> 00:13:35.856 A:middle
in code.

00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:38.026 A:middle
In order to preview and present

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:39.466 A:middle
documents, we need to

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.506 A:middle
instantiate a

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:41.466 A:middle
QLPreviewController.

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:42.856 A:middle
It's part of the Quick Look

00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:43.216 A:middle
framework.

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:45.756 A:middle
It has a dataSource and a

00:13:45.756 --> 00:13:47.346 A:middle
delegate, which I'll get into in

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:47.686 A:middle
a bit.

00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:50.016 A:middle
And then we then present the

00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:51.276 A:middle
previewController modally.

00:13:52.326 --> 00:13:53.086 A:middle
Pretty simple, right.

00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:54.976 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:13:54.976 --> 00:13:56.476 A:middle
protocol for a dataSource.

00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:00.026 A:middle
So, as I just mentioned, we need
