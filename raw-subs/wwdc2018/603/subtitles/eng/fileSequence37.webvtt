00:36:59.316 --> 00:37:00.656 A:middle
transforms in your models and

00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:01.956 A:middle
merge any adjacent vertices to

00:37:02.196 --> 00:37:03.576 A:middle
tidy them up ready for export.

00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:06.306 A:middle
And if you can, try and use a

00:37:06.306 --> 00:37:08.086 A:middle
single material and texture set

00:37:08.086 --> 00:37:08.976 A:middle
for the entire model.

00:37:10.056 --> 00:37:11.526 A:middle
This enables you to optimize how

00:37:11.526 --> 00:37:12.866 A:middle
you pack the different parts of

00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:14.456 A:middle
that model into those square

00:37:14.456 --> 00:37:15.396 A:middle
textures that you're using.

00:37:15.926 --> 00:37:18.666 A:middle
And if you don't need a texture,

00:37:19.256 --> 00:37:21.416 A:middle
don't include it.

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:22.256 A:middle
If none of the parts of your

00:37:22.256 --> 00:37:23.266 A:middle
model are made from metal,

00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:24.336 A:middle
there's no need to provide a

00:37:24.336 --> 00:37:25.076 A:middle
metallic texture.

00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:26.866 A:middle
The default is non-metallic for

00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:28.306 A:middle
any model that's loaded.

00:37:29.316 --> 00:37:30.846 A:middle
When you're choosing where to

00:37:30.846 --> 00:37:32.116 A:middle
spend your texture budget,

00:37:32.616 --> 00:37:34.236 A:middle
prioritize the areas that give

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:35.876 A:middle
most realism to that model.

00:37:35.876 --> 00:37:38.046 A:middle
For some models, that might be a

00:37:38.116 --> 00:37:39.646 A:middle
high-resolution albedo texture.

00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:41.116 A:middle
For others, it might be better

00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.886 A:middle
spent on roughness or the normal

00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:42.976 A:middle
map.

00:37:45.136 --> 00:37:46.636 A:middle
And remember the pixels actually

00:37:46.636 --> 00:37:48.486 A:middle
have a physical size in AR.

00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:50.856 A:middle
If you're printing a model of a

00:37:50.856 --> 00:37:52.206 A:middle
thimble, and it's one inch

00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:54.566 A:middle
across, there's probably no need

00:37:54.566 --> 00:37:56.376 A:middle
to use a 2k by 2k texture for

00:37:56.376 --> 00:37:56.443 A:middle
it.

00:37:56.786 --> 00:37:58.116 A:middle
Those pixels will be tiny in the

00:37:58.116 --> 00:37:59.186 A:middle
real world.
