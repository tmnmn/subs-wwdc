[to get right in our 3D software](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/603/?time=1274) [to make our model

first is that the object](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/603/?time=1279) [should face toward the

[Secondly, the base of the object](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/603/?time=1284) [should sit on the ground

side,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/603/?time=1320) [we can see this model has

[So, let's move it up such that](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018/videos/play/wwdc2018/603/?time=1325) [its base is set on our
