Some tips as you add animation

00:26:01.716 --> 00:26:02.306 A:middle
to your models.

00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:04.986 A:middle
Firstly, choose animations that

00:26:04.986 --> 00:26:06.796 A:middle
enhance the AR immersiveness,

00:26:06.856 --> 00:26:07.946 A:middle
that make you feel more like

00:26:07.946 --> 00:26:08.876 A:middle
that object is there in the

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:08.976 A:middle
room.

00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.826 A:middle
Now, because people can

00:26:11.826 --> 00:26:13.306 A:middle
manipulate your objects, they

00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:14.996 A:middle
can retape them, scale them, and

00:26:14.996 --> 00:26:17.206 A:middle
move them around, it's important

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:18.296 A:middle
not to move them away from the

00:26:18.296 --> 00:26:18.696 A:middle
origin.

00:26:19.586 --> 00:26:21.306 A:middle
If I create a car that zooms

00:26:21.306 --> 00:26:22.806 A:middle
around in a meter-wide circle,

00:26:23.486 --> 00:26:24.386 A:middle
when someone tries to put their

00:26:24.386 --> 00:26:25.566 A:middle
finger on that car to pick it

00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:27.176 A:middle
up, it's already moved away and

00:26:27.176 --> 00:26:28.026 A:middle
zooms somewhere else.

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.256 A:middle
So, that gesture is very

00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:30.576 A:middle
confusing to somebody trying to

00:26:30.576 --> 00:26:31.496 A:middle
manipulate that object.

00:26:32.106 --> 00:26:33.306 A:middle
So, try and keep those objects

00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:34.156 A:middle
centered at the origin.

00:26:34.686 --> 00:26:37.536 A:middle
For the same reasons, try and

00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:39.176 A:middle
keep a consistent bounding box

00:26:39.176 --> 00:26:40.096 A:middle
throughout the animation as

00:26:40.096 --> 00:26:40.316 A:middle
well.

00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:42.016 A:middle
Even if the object is at one

00:26:42.016 --> 00:26:44.036 A:middle
location, it's much easier for

00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:45.606 A:middle
me to manipulate it if it stays

00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:46.496 A:middle
in the same place under my

00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:48.116 A:middle
fingers throughout the entire

00:26:48.116 --> 00:26:48.496 A:middle
gesture.

00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:53.016 A:middle
As a result, prefer animations

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:54.446 A:middle
that make sense at a static

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:54.936 A:middle
location.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.516 A:middle
If you have a T-rex character,

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:59.256 A:middle
rather than giving it a walk

00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
cycle that would make it look
