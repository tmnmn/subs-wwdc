00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
Now, because animations loop, we

00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:01.606 A:middle
could choose a different

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.936 A:middle
starting point, a more neutral

00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:03.966 A:middle
one where the ball's in the

00:29:03.966 --> 00:29:06.016 A:middle
center and still have the same

00:29:06.016 --> 00:29:07.166 A:middle
animation, the same overall

00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:07.496 A:middle
effect.

00:29:08.206 --> 00:29:09.676 A:middle
But now, by choosing a better

00:29:09.676 --> 00:29:11.386 A:middle
first frame, our shadow makes

00:29:11.386 --> 00:29:12.306 A:middle
sense throughout the entire

00:29:12.306 --> 00:29:12.756 A:middle
animation.

00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:17.136 A:middle
One of the biggest things we can

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:18.866 A:middle
modify about our model to make

00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:20.786 A:middle
it feel real in the world is the

00:29:20.786 --> 00:29:21.806 A:middle
model's appearance.

00:29:23.056 --> 00:29:25.486 A:middle
Now, here, AR Quick Look uses a

00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:27.076 A:middle
Physically Based Rendering, or

00:29:27.076 --> 00:29:29.206 A:middle
PBR shader, and this gives us

00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:30.706 A:middle
six things that we can modify

00:29:30.816 --> 00:29:32.406 A:middle
about our model's appearance to

00:29:32.406 --> 00:29:33.836 A:middle
make it feel more real in the

00:29:33.836 --> 00:29:34.146 A:middle
world.

00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:36.206 A:middle
We do this by providing

00:29:36.206 --> 00:29:37.666 A:middle
textures, images, for each of

00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:38.866 A:middle
these six things if we want to.

00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:41.996 A:middle
The first is the model's albedo.

00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:43.916 A:middle
This is the base color of the

00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:45.816 A:middle
model, its underlying color.

00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:48.486 A:middle
The second is indicating which

00:29:48.526 --> 00:29:50.076 A:middle
parts of the model are metallic.

00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:52.076 A:middle
This changes whether they are a

00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:53.836 A:middle
conductor or an insulator, which

00:29:53.836 --> 00:29:55.126 A:middle
changes how they interact with

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.236 A:middle
the physics of light in the real

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:56.596 A:middle
world.

00:29:58.026 --> 00:29:59.796 A:middle
We could also specify which

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:01.416 A:middle
parts of our model are rough or
