00:32:58.016 --> 00:33:00.746 A:middle
It's actually emitting light.

00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:02.266 A:middle
Emissive texture is a fairly

00:33:02.266 --> 00:33:03.606 A:middle
special case but not something

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:04.636 A:middle
you'd use every day.

00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:06.326 A:middle
But if the object you're

00:33:06.326 --> 00:33:07.656 A:middle
modeling would glow if you

00:33:07.656 --> 00:33:09.116 A:middle
turned the lights off, it might

00:33:09.116 --> 00:33:10.056 A:middle
be a good candidate for an

00:33:10.056 --> 00:33:10.716 A:middle
emissive texture.

00:33:13.196 --> 00:33:14.446 A:middle
We can also make parts of our

00:33:14.446 --> 00:33:15.596 A:middle
models transparent.

00:33:15.596 --> 00:33:17.366 A:middle
This is useful for making

00:33:17.366 --> 00:33:18.516 A:middle
objects made out of partly

00:33:18.516 --> 00:33:19.296 A:middle
glass, for example.

00:33:19.626 --> 00:33:22.686 A:middle
If you do this, be sure to use a

00:33:22.686 --> 00:33:24.256 A:middle
separate material for the

00:33:24.256 --> 00:33:25.986 A:middle
transparent and non-transparent

00:33:25.986 --> 00:33:27.366 A:middle
parts of your model to ensure

00:33:27.366 --> 00:33:28.116 A:middle
they render correctly.

00:33:28.696 --> 00:33:31.366 A:middle
You do this by providing an

00:33:31.366 --> 00:33:32.736 A:middle
albedo texture that has the

00:33:32.736 --> 00:33:34.156 A:middle
transparency in its alpha

00:33:34.156 --> 00:33:34.536 A:middle
channel.

00:33:34.786 --> 00:33:36.666 A:middle
So, a transparent PNG file, for

00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:37.056 A:middle
example.

00:33:38.506 --> 00:33:40.046 A:middle
Note that transparency is really

00:33:40.046 --> 00:33:41.726 A:middle
intended for see-through parts

00:33:41.726 --> 00:33:43.216 A:middle
of the model, not for creating

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:44.796 A:middle
cutouts like a leaf edge or a

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:45.396 A:middle
butterfly wing.

00:33:45.956 --> 00:33:48.896 A:middle
We'll see this in action for our

00:33:48.996 --> 00:33:50.196 A:middle
TV model from before.

00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:52.336 A:middle
In addition to the mesh we

00:33:52.336 --> 00:33:53.596 A:middle
already have for the base of the

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:55.806 A:middle
model, I'm going to add a second

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:57.436 A:middle
mesh for a curved screen, a

00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:58.416 A:middle
screen cover that's made of

00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:00.346 A:middle
glass, with a slight amount of
