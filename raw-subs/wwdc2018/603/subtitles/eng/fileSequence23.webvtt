00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:01.206 A:middle
transition between the two.

00:23:01.886 --> 00:23:03.086 A:middle
So, choosing a good profile is

00:23:03.136 --> 00:23:03.786 A:middle
really important.

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:07.076 A:middle
We'll head back into our 3D

00:23:07.076 --> 00:23:09.316 A:middle
software and rotate our model so

00:23:09.316 --> 00:23:10.346 A:middle
the spout is to the side.

00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.386 A:middle
As one final check before we

00:23:13.386 --> 00:23:15.446 A:middle
export it, let's take a top-down

00:23:15.446 --> 00:23:16.826 A:middle
view and make sure that that

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:18.496 A:middle
bowl is centered on the origin,

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:19.796 A:middle
so it will spin around the point

00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:22.636 A:middle
we want it to.

00:23:22.866 --> 00:23:24.276 A:middle
The second thing we want to set

00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:25.996 A:middle
up for our model is its physical

00:23:25.996 --> 00:23:26.456 A:middle
size.

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:28.916 A:middle
Here, I have a gramophone record

00:23:28.916 --> 00:23:30.706 A:middle
player, and size matters here.

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:32.406 A:middle
This record player is designed

00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:34.086 A:middle
to play 12-inch records, so we

00:23:34.086 --> 00:23:35.106 A:middle
need to make sure it's the right

00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:35.786 A:middle
size in the world.

00:23:36.236 --> 00:23:38.976 A:middle
If I export this model and load

00:23:38.976 --> 00:23:40.766 A:middle
it in object mode in AR Quick

00:23:40.766 --> 00:23:42.496 A:middle
Look, it looks great because we

00:23:42.496 --> 00:23:43.756 A:middle
always scale models to fit in

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:44.146 A:middle
this mode.

00:23:44.906 --> 00:23:46.126 A:middle
But if I place it in the world,

00:23:46.606 --> 00:23:47.576 A:middle
we can see there's a problem

00:23:47.706 --> 00:23:49.136 A:middle
when I put it next to a 12-inch

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:49.496 A:middle
record.

00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:50.806 A:middle
It's far too small.

00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:52.786 A:middle
Right now, it's set up to play

00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:54.416 A:middle
6-inch records, and they don't

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:54.836 A:middle
exist.

00:23:56.446 --> 00:23:58.226 A:middle
So, let's head back into my 3D

00:23:58.226 --> 00:24:00.306 A:middle
software and create a reference,
