00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:01.246 A:middle
experience what the model looks

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:01.936 A:middle
like in your world.

00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:04.896 A:middle
So, here, I have a modern

00:17:04.896 --> 00:17:06.056 A:middle
version of my online garden

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:08.006 A:middle
store with various thumbnails of

00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:08.945 A:middle
gardening tools I have listed

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:09.296 A:middle
for sale.

00:17:10.626 --> 00:17:11.965 A:middle
For better integration of AR on

00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:13.836 A:middle
my web content, I'll use the new

00:17:13.836 --> 00:17:15.146 A:middle
HTML markup that I'm about to

00:17:15.146 --> 00:17:15.826 A:middle
show you shortly.

00:17:16.576 --> 00:17:17.756 A:middle
This opens up and allows

00:17:17.756 --> 00:17:19.036 A:middle
customers to preview my

00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:20.715 A:middle
gardening tools before they

00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:21.616 A:middle
actually purchase it.

00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:24.576 A:middle
So, by following this markup,

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.046 A:middle
you had a badge that I mentioned

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.646 A:middle
earlier, rendered on the image

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.606 A:middle
in the top right-hand corner,

00:17:28.946 --> 00:17:30.706 A:middle
and this is useful and there to

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.076 A:middle
tell you that our system viewer

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.506 A:middle
is behind this so you can

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:35.246 A:middle
preview my watering can in AR.

00:17:35.996 --> 00:17:39.036 A:middle
So, you can provide your own

00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:40.636 A:middle
cover artwork associated to the

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:41.996 A:middle
3D object, and this can be a

00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:43.996 A:middle
portrait shot or nice hero image

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.176 A:middle
like I've chosen for my lovely

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:45.926 A:middle
watering can.

00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:48.626 A:middle
And with this flow, we support

00:17:48.626 --> 00:17:53.066 A:middle
drag and drop and, of course,

00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:55.446 A:middle
long-press Safari actions from

00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:57.356 A:middle
Safari like Add to Reading List

00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:58.886 A:middle
or Copy and Share.
