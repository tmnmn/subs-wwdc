00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.326 A:middle
just providing the 3D content

00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:02.036 A:middle
and we make this super easy for

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:02.966 A:middle
you so you don't have to deal

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.486 A:middle
with any AR specifics.

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:07.386 A:middle
So, how about we see AR Quick

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:08.546 A:middle
Look in action with the web

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:08.826 A:middle
demo.

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:16.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:18.206 A:middle
So, here, I have the files up,

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.096 A:middle
and I have a catalogue of 3D

00:04:20.096 --> 00:04:20.606 A:middle
objects.

00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:22.656 A:middle
You'll notice that there's these

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:24.286 A:middle
rich and beautiful thumbnails

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:26.146 A:middle
with the AR badge stamp at the

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:27.366 A:middle
top right-hand corner, and

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.156 A:middle
that's there to tell you that

00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:29.376 A:middle
there's an AR experience behind

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:29.666 A:middle
this.

00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:31.806 A:middle
So, I have a lot of great models

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.356 A:middle
to choose from, but my personal

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.926 A:middle
favorite is this little purple

00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:36.716 A:middle
guy at the top right-hand

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:37.036 A:middle
corner.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:39.576 A:middle
So, Radar is our bug tracking

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:41.366 A:middle
software, and if you don't know,

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.156 A:middle
the purple aardvark is our

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:43.556 A:middle
mascot.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.976 A:middle
So, I'll go ahead and Quick Look

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:47.496 A:middle
the purple aardvark into the

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:50.816 A:middle
viewer where we can see her in

00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:52.886 A:middle
our studio-like environment,

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.006 A:middle
which we call object mode.

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.426 A:middle
So, you can really pan around

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:58.466 A:middle
and see the model from various

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.176 A:middle
different angles.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.316 A:middle
We can pinch to size an object
