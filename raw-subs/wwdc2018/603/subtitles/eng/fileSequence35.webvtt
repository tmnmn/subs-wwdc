00:34:57.266 --> 00:35:04.146 A:middle
So, 2k, 1k, 512 pixels, so on.

00:35:04.426 --> 00:35:06.386 A:middle
David mentioned earlier that AR

00:35:06.386 --> 00:35:07.956 A:middle
Quick Look is available on all

00:35:07.956 --> 00:35:10.756 A:middle
devices that support iOS 12, and

00:35:10.756 --> 00:35:12.036 A:middle
this is actually quite a range

00:35:12.036 --> 00:35:13.176 A:middle
of devices with different

00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:13.816 A:middle
capabilities.

00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:17.856 A:middle
Now, because AR Quick Look is a

00:35:17.856 --> 00:35:20.076 A:middle
system-wide extension, this

00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:21.206 A:middle
means it has to share the

00:35:21.206 --> 00:35:22.736 A:middle
available system memory with the

00:35:22.736 --> 00:35:24.026 A:middle
applications that launch it.

00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:26.046 A:middle
And so, there's only so much

00:35:26.046 --> 00:35:27.866 A:middle
memory available to display and

00:35:27.866 --> 00:35:28.626 A:middle
load these models.

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:32.586 A:middle
To help with this, we recommend

00:35:32.586 --> 00:35:34.366 A:middle
that you create and optimize and

00:35:34.446 --> 00:35:36.376 A:middle
test your models for high memory

00:35:36.376 --> 00:35:38.786 A:middle
devices like the iPhone 7 Plus,

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:41.706 A:middle
8 Plus, and X, and the iPad Pro

00:35:41.966 --> 00:35:42.816 A:middle
12.9 inch.

00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:45.956 A:middle
If you do this, AR Quick Look

00:35:45.956 --> 00:35:47.736 A:middle
will dynamically downsample the

00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:49.346 A:middle
textures in your model for other

00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:50.206 A:middle
devices of different

00:35:50.206 --> 00:35:51.556 A:middle
capabilities, if needed.

00:35:52.266 --> 00:35:53.216 A:middle
This means you can make the

00:35:53.216 --> 00:35:54.626 A:middle
devices, your models look great

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.076 A:middle
on those devices but still know

00:35:56.076 --> 00:35:56.776 A:middle
they'll work everywhere.

00:35:56.776 --> 00:35:59.786 A:middle
Know that the meshes and the

00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:01.156 A:middle
animations won't be modified.
