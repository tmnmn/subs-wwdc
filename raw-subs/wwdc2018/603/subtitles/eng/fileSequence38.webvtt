00:38:00.586 --> 00:38:02.156 A:middle
And although we want models to

00:38:02.156 --> 00:38:03.986 A:middle
look great, we also need to

00:38:03.986 --> 00:38:05.866 A:middle
balance texture size and quality

00:38:05.866 --> 00:38:06.846 A:middle
against file size.

00:38:07.466 --> 00:38:08.496 A:middle
If a model is being downloaded

00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:10.056 A:middle
from a website, we want it to be

00:38:10.056 --> 00:38:11.646 A:middle
a good size for downloading and

00:38:11.646 --> 00:38:13.376 A:middle
also for sharing via messages

00:38:13.376 --> 00:38:15.006 A:middle
and mail and other means.

00:38:17.156 --> 00:38:18.796 A:middle
So, with all of that in mind,

00:38:19.516 --> 00:38:20.416 A:middle
how do we make these things?

00:38:21.416 --> 00:38:23.276 A:middle
Well for this, we have a usdz

00:38:23.276 --> 00:38:24.026 A:middle
Converter.

00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:26.806 A:middle
This is a command line tool that

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:28.976 A:middle
will convert existing 3D models

00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:30.286 A:middle
to usdz format.

00:38:31.486 --> 00:38:34.516 A:middle
It ships inside Xcode 10, and in

00:38:34.516 --> 00:38:36.556 A:middle
addition to creating usdz files,

00:38:37.206 --> 00:38:38.726 A:middle
you could also use it to map PBR

00:38:38.726 --> 00:38:40.646 A:middle
textures to the meshes and

00:38:40.646 --> 00:38:42.176 A:middle
submeshes inside those existing

00:38:42.176 --> 00:38:42.476 A:middle
models.

00:38:43.156 --> 00:38:47.226 A:middle
It's X3 input format, OBJ files,

00:38:47.446 --> 00:38:49.706 A:middle
Alembic files, and existing USD

00:38:49.706 --> 00:38:52.736 A:middle
files, either USDA or USDC, the

00:38:52.736 --> 00:38:54.586 A:middle
ASCII and binary versions of

00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:55.206 A:middle
USD.

00:38:56.496 --> 00:38:58.456 A:middle
Before we create one, let's take

00:38:58.456 --> 00:38:59.396 A:middle
a look at what it is we're going

00:38:59.396 --> 00:38:59.736 A:middle
to make.

00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.586 A:middle
Let's look inside a usdz file.
