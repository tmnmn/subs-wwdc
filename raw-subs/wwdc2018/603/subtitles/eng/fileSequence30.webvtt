00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:01.416 A:middle
parts of our model are rough or

00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:02.996 A:middle
shiny by providing a roughness

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.366 A:middle
texture.

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.246 A:middle
We can add in a normal map.

00:30:06.896 --> 00:30:08.056 A:middle
This creates the illusion of

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:09.326 A:middle
depth and variances within the

00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:11.176 A:middle
surfaces, the model's surface,

00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:12.606 A:middle
without changing the underlying

00:30:12.606 --> 00:30:13.026 A:middle
mesh.

00:30:13.596 --> 00:30:16.086 A:middle
We can add an ambient occlusion

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.896 A:middle
texture to specify where the

00:30:17.896 --> 00:30:19.746 A:middle
model casts shadows on itself in

00:30:19.746 --> 00:30:21.036 A:middle
the crevices and nooks and

00:30:21.036 --> 00:30:21.776 A:middle
crannies of the model.

00:30:23.036 --> 00:30:24.726 A:middle
And if our model emits lights,

00:30:25.066 --> 00:30:26.306 A:middle
we can provide an emissive

00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:27.916 A:middle
texture for things like a TV

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:29.346 A:middle
screen or a computer monitor.

00:30:29.926 --> 00:30:32.276 A:middle
Now, if you're just getting

00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:34.456 A:middle
started with PBR, we have a

00:30:34.456 --> 00:30:35.886 A:middle
session on Thursday about

00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:38.006 A:middle
creating PBR-based models for

00:30:38.006 --> 00:30:39.826 A:middle
any AR experience, and I highly

00:30:39.826 --> 00:30:40.726 A:middle
recommend you check it out.

00:30:42.036 --> 00:30:43.366 A:middle
For now, we'll take a look at

00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:45.306 A:middle
how these six textures affect AR

00:30:45.306 --> 00:30:46.456 A:middle
Quick Look particularly.

00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:49.566 A:middle
So, I'll start with a model of a

00:30:49.566 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
TV.

00:30:50.606 --> 00:30:52.106 A:middle
Right now, it has no textures.

00:30:52.196 --> 00:30:53.586 A:middle
It's pretty bland.

00:30:55.016 --> 00:30:57.356 A:middle
We'll bring in an albedo texture

00:30:57.546 --> 00:30:59.386 A:middle
to give it some base color, and

00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
it's much more recognizable as a
