00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
file is safely read to present a

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.746 A:middle
preview for you.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.566 A:middle
Now, there's a dedicated endup

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:06.696 A:middle
session about Quick Look and

00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:08.006 A:middle
previewing all file types,

00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:10.056 A:middle
including the new usdz file type

00:12:10.056 --> 00:12:10.916 A:middle
that I encourage you to check

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:10.983 A:middle
out.

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:15.426 A:middle
So, let's take a quick look at

00:12:15.426 --> 00:12:16.716 A:middle
the preview flow.

00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:18.006 A:middle
Here's the apps ViewController

00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:18.596 A:middle
on the left.

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.816 A:middle
It has a grid of thumbnails for

00:12:20.816 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
various 3D models.

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:23.376 A:middle
When someone taps on one of

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:24.896 A:middle
these thumbnails, I want to show

00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:25.726 A:middle
a Quick Look preview of the

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:26.886 A:middle
model for that thumbnail.

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:29.246 A:middle
The first thing I want to do is

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:31.126 A:middle
create a QLPreviewController.

00:12:31.596 --> 00:12:32.826 A:middle
I have instance, I have

00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:34.096 A:middle
ViewController that allows you

00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:35.046 A:middle
to preview documents.

00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:37.876 A:middle
And I set myself as a dataSource

00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:38.706 A:middle
and a delegate.

00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:40.586 A:middle
So it can ask me questions about

00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:41.476 A:middle
what should be previewed.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:43.876 A:middle
With that configured, I present

00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:45.256 A:middle
that QLPreviewController.

00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:47.836 A:middle
Now, it doesn't appear

00:12:47.836 --> 00:12:48.766 A:middle
immediately, however.

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:50.636 A:middle
It first asks me some questions.

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.186 A:middle
It starts by asking how many

00:12:53.186 --> 00:12:54.486 A:middle
items do you have for me to

00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:55.826 A:middle
preview?

00:12:55.826 --> 00:12:57.736 A:middle
And for usdz files, the answer

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:58.096 A:middle
is one.

00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:01.746 A:middle
Now, it asks me for a URL for
