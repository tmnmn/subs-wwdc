00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
in the real world.

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:02.196 A:middle
And you'll see, we have quite a

00:32:02.196 --> 00:32:03.476 A:middle
lot of variance in our roughness

00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:04.726 A:middle
texture, even within the same

00:32:04.726 --> 00:32:06.446 A:middle
parts of the model, to give more

00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.516 A:middle
realism and to bring it more to

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:07.736 A:middle
life.

00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:12.676 A:middle
Next, we'll add a normal map to

00:32:12.676 --> 00:32:14.036 A:middle
add the illusion of variance,

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:15.866 A:middle
particularly in the woodgrain on

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:16.846 A:middle
top of the TV here.

00:32:17.426 --> 00:32:18.376 A:middle
The underlying mesh hasn't

00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:20.286 A:middle
changed, but it feels more 3D.

00:32:20.466 --> 00:32:21.616 A:middle
Also, on the speaker grill.

00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:25.506 A:middle
Because we have some crevices

00:32:25.506 --> 00:32:26.686 A:middle
and some hidden areas on the

00:32:26.686 --> 00:32:28.076 A:middle
front of the TV that would cast

00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:29.876 A:middle
shadows on themselves, we'll add

00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:31.516 A:middle
in an ambient occlusion texture.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:34.066 A:middle
The effect is pretty subtle, but

00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:35.206 A:middle
it does add to the depth of the

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:36.906 A:middle
model and make it feel more real

00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:37.796 A:middle
when it's in the world.

00:32:38.366 --> 00:32:41.116 A:middle
And because this is a TV with a

00:32:41.116 --> 00:32:43.176 A:middle
screen, we'll add an emissive

00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:45.056 A:middle
texture as well to indicate that

00:32:45.056 --> 00:32:46.456 A:middle
the screen emits light into the

00:32:46.456 --> 00:32:46.786 A:middle
world.

00:32:48.076 --> 00:32:49.356 A:middle
The effect of this is best seen

00:32:49.356 --> 00:32:50.696 A:middle
when pushing the object into a

00:32:50.696 --> 00:32:51.006 A:middle
room.

00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:53.136 A:middle
Here, we can see that the main

00:32:53.136 --> 00:32:54.706 A:middle
body of the TV reflects the

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:55.876 A:middle
ambient lighting conditions of

00:32:55.876 --> 00:32:57.466 A:middle
the room it's in, but the screen

00:32:57.466 --> 00:32:58.016 A:middle
is brighter.

00:32:58.016 --> 00:33:00.746 A:middle
It's actually emitting light.
