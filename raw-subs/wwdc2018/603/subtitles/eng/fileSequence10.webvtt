And usdz is supported on iOS and

00:10:03.576 --> 00:10:06.206 A:middle
macOS, in SceneKit and Model

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.726 A:middle
I/O, and later in the session,

00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:10.316 A:middle
we'll show you how to convert 3D

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:12.726 A:middle
models into the usdz format

00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:15.016 A:middle
using the new usdz Converter

00:10:15.016 --> 00:10:16.916 A:middle
tool that ships as part of Xcode

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:17.006 A:middle
10.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:20.616 A:middle
Now that you know more about AR

00:10:20.616 --> 00:10:22.056 A:middle
Quick Look, let's talk about how

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:23.506 A:middle
to integrate the viewer itself.

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:26.206 A:middle
You can integrate AR Quick Look

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:27.786 A:middle
in two different mediums.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.776 A:middle
The first, in an application.

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:31.716 A:middle
Apps that showcase a lot of

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:33.726 A:middle
photos and text can provide

00:10:33.726 --> 00:10:35.476 A:middle
better imagery and a really

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:36.926 A:middle
immersive experience with AR

00:10:36.926 --> 00:10:37.756 A:middle
Quick Look integrated.

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:39.896 A:middle
And here, we're using Quick Look

00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:41.516 A:middle
API to facilitate this

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.416 A:middle
integration, to preview usdz

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.066 A:middle
files, and load them into the

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:45.366 A:middle
viewer.

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
Second, is in websites in

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:48.546 A:middle
Safari.

00:10:49.376 --> 00:10:51.106 A:middle
So, integrating AR Quick Look in

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.946 A:middle
news articles and product pages

00:10:52.946 --> 00:10:54.506 A:middle
of online storefronts really

00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:55.626 A:middle
complements the reading and

00:10:55.626 --> 00:10:57.496 A:middle
shopping experience by providing

00:10:57.496 --> 00:10:58.836 A:middle
