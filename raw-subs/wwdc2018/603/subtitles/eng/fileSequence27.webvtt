00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
cycle that would make it look

00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:01.706 A:middle
like it was running on the spot,

00:27:02.336 --> 00:27:03.946 A:middle
make it roar or stamp its feet

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:05.316 A:middle
or something else that makes

00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:06.526 A:middle
sense at a static location.

00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:09.396 A:middle
Now, there is an alternative.

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:11.826 A:middle
You can also consider creating

00:27:11.826 --> 00:27:13.216 A:middle
animations as self-contained

00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:14.636 A:middle
scenes to help with these

00:27:14.636 --> 00:27:15.636 A:middle
gesture manipulations.

00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:17.256 A:middle
And let's see an example of how

00:27:17.256 --> 00:27:17.756 A:middle
that can work.

00:27:18.806 --> 00:27:20.566 A:middle
Here, I have a swimming koi

00:27:20.566 --> 00:27:22.236 A:middle
fish, and it makes sense for

00:27:22.236 --> 00:27:23.176 A:middle
this fish to have some

00:27:23.176 --> 00:27:23.786 A:middle
translation.

00:27:24.406 --> 00:27:25.806 A:middle
So, we created a scene with an

00:27:25.806 --> 00:27:28.106 A:middle
aquarium base, and this means

00:27:28.106 --> 00:27:29.336 A:middle
when we place this in the world,

00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:31.986 A:middle
if we rotate it, or if we move

00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:34.256 A:middle
it, the scene we're manipulating

00:27:34.256 --> 00:27:36.566 A:middle
is the scene, not the fish, and

00:27:36.566 --> 00:27:37.916 A:middle
so the gesture makes a lot more

00:27:37.916 --> 00:27:38.176 A:middle
sense.

00:27:39.476 --> 00:27:40.916 A:middle
It also means by having a base

00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.156 A:middle
to our scene that we have a

00:27:42.156 --> 00:27:43.486 A:middle
consistent bounding box

00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:44.876 A:middle
throughout the entire animation.

00:27:45.326 --> 00:27:48.846 A:middle
Another thing that really brings

00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:49.996 A:middle
your models to life in the world

00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:51.576 A:middle
is that contact shadow.

00:27:52.466 --> 00:27:54.496 A:middle
Now, note here that AR Quick

00:27:54.496 --> 00:27:55.886 A:middle
Look provides the contact shadow

00:27:55.886 --> 00:27:56.386 A:middle
for you.

00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:58.536 A:middle
This means that it can turn the

00:27:58.536 --> 00:27:59.976 A:middle
shadow on and off as you

00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:00.976 A:middle
transition between modes.
