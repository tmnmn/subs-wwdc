content and develop a better

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:01.876 A:middle
understanding of what you're

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:03.366 A:middle
actually seeing, and we'll be

00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:06.046 A:middle
writing HTML to allow previewing

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:07.986 A:middle
AR content on the web.

00:11:09.526 --> 00:11:10.306 A:middle
So, let's get started with

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:11.856 A:middle
applications and how the Quick

00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:14.036 A:middle
Look API is used to provide an

00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:14.906 A:middle
AR experience.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.126 A:middle
So, if you're not already

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:19.026 A:middle
familiar, let me quickly explain

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:19.456 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:21.266 A:middle
Quick Look is all about

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:22.836 A:middle
previewing documents like

00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:26.206 A:middle
Keynotes, PDFs, images, and now

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:27.706 A:middle
3D model files like usdz.

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.376 A:middle
Quick Look itself is an iOS

00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:31.786 A:middle
framework that not only provides

00:11:31.786 --> 00:11:33.756 A:middle
support to preview documents,

00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:35.126 A:middle
but also will be really to

00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:37.066 A:middle
create and provide custom

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:38.386 A:middle
previews for your custom file

00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:38.846 A:middle
types.

00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:40.906 A:middle
It comes with everything you

00:11:40.906 --> 00:11:42.206 A:middle
need to preview documents.

00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:44.456 A:middle
You can control the transition

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.376 A:middle
and the different presentation

00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:47.996 A:middle
modes for Quick Look, like being

00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:50.026 A:middle
embedded inline or incorporating

00:11:50.026 --> 00:11:51.786 A:middle
a push navigation flow and the

00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:53.016 A:middle
standard modal presentation.

00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:55.226 A:middle
And what's really amazing is

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:56.856 A:middle
that security is handled for you

00:11:57.276 --> 00:11:58.606 A:middle
where the contents of the usdz

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
file is safely read to present a
