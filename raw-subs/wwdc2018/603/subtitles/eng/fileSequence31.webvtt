00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
it's much more recognizable as a

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:02.786 A:middle
TV now, but it's still very

00:31:02.786 --> 00:31:03.066 A:middle
flat.

00:31:03.346 --> 00:31:04.426 A:middle
It doesn't feel realistic.

00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:07.976 A:middle
The next thing we'll do is to

00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:10.166 A:middle
introduce a metallic texture to

00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:11.416 A:middle
make the trim around the TV

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:13.666 A:middle
screen and the antenna on top to

00:31:13.666 --> 00:31:14.776 A:middle
indicate that they're made from

00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:15.086 A:middle
metal.

00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:17.266 A:middle
Note here that our metallic

00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:18.946 A:middle
texture is pretty much black and

00:31:18.946 --> 00:31:19.186 A:middle
white.

00:31:19.676 --> 00:31:21.166 A:middle
Things either are a metal, or

00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:21.436 A:middle
they aren't.

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.206 A:middle
But the metal still doesn't look

00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:25.386 A:middle
as realistic as we want it to

00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:26.886 A:middle
do, and that's because the

00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:28.606 A:middle
metal, like all of the model, is

00:31:28.606 --> 00:31:29.766 A:middle
entirely rough.

00:31:30.056 --> 00:31:31.356 A:middle
There's no shine, there's no

00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:32.916 A:middle
smooth surfaces on this TV right

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:32.983 A:middle
now.

00:31:35.306 --> 00:31:37.106 A:middle
To fix that, we'll bring in a

00:31:37.106 --> 00:31:39.176 A:middle
roughness texture, and at this

00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:40.316 A:middle
point the model really comes to

00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:40.626 A:middle
life.

00:31:41.656 --> 00:31:43.076 A:middle
The metal around the TV screen

00:31:43.076 --> 00:31:44.506 A:middle
and the aerial now looks like

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:44.876 A:middle
metal.

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:46.786 A:middle
It looks like chrome, and the

00:31:46.786 --> 00:31:48.486 A:middle
wood on the top of our TV

00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:49.646 A:middle
actually looks like it has a

00:31:49.646 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
varnish or lacquer effect.

00:31:51.236 --> 00:31:52.266 A:middle
We can believe it much more

00:31:52.266 --> 00:31:54.686 A:middle
realistically as a TV.

00:31:54.866 --> 00:31:55.946 A:middle
And roughness is one of the

00:31:55.946 --> 00:31:57.426 A:middle
biggest points of creative

00:31:57.426 --> 00:31:58.696 A:middle
control you have over the look

00:31:58.696 --> 00:31:59.936 A:middle
of your model and how it feels

00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
in the real world.
