00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.586 A:middle
Let's look inside a usdz file.

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:04.406 A:middle
In essence, these are

00:39:04.406 --> 00:39:06.146 A:middle
uncompressed zip archives.

00:39:06.926 --> 00:39:09.626 A:middle
The first file is always a usdc

00:39:09.756 --> 00:39:10.016 A:middle
file.

00:39:10.786 --> 00:39:12.236 A:middle
This contains the model's mesh,

00:39:12.546 --> 00:39:13.936 A:middle
its animation, if it has some,

00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:15.536 A:middle
and any material definitions it

00:39:15.536 --> 00:39:15.726 A:middle
needs.

00:39:16.976 --> 00:39:17.936 A:middle
And then, the remainder of the

00:39:17.936 --> 00:39:19.916 A:middle
files in the archive are any

00:39:19.996 --> 00:39:21.276 A:middle
textures, any images, like the

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:22.876 A:middle
ones we saw earlier on.

00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:25.446 A:middle
If you're thinking of creating

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.666 A:middle
your own tooling to build usdz

00:39:27.666 --> 00:39:29.406 A:middle
files, the great news is that

00:39:29.406 --> 00:39:30.246 A:middle
this is that this is an open

00:39:30.246 --> 00:39:32.436 A:middle
format and Pixar have published

00:39:32.486 --> 00:39:33.856 A:middle
the direct specification for

00:39:33.856 --> 00:39:36.536 A:middle
usdz on the graphics.pixar.com

00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:37.206 A:middle
site.

00:39:38.836 --> 00:39:40.446 A:middle
To create one with a usdz

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:42.486 A:middle
converter, first note that we

00:39:42.486 --> 00:39:44.476 A:middle
call the tool with xcrun because

00:39:44.476 --> 00:39:45.556 A:middle
it shifts inside Xcode.

00:39:46.476 --> 00:39:47.516 A:middle
We pass in the name of the model

00:39:47.516 --> 00:39:49.436 A:middle
we want to convert, an OBJ file

00:39:49.436 --> 00:39:51.206 A:middle
in this case, and the file name

00:39:51.206 --> 00:39:52.866 A:middle
of the usdz we want to have the

00:39:52.866 --> 00:39:53.706 A:middle
other end.

00:39:54.676 --> 00:39:56.766 A:middle
To map PBR textures to the

00:39:56.766 --> 00:39:59.246 A:middle
meshes they're in, we use the -g

00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:00.816 A:middle
option, followed by the name of
