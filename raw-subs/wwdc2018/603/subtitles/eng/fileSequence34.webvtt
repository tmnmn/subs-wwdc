00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:00.346 A:middle
glass, with a slight amount of

00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
dirt on the screen.

00:34:01.736 --> 00:34:04.606 A:middle
Here's how it looks in AR Quick

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:04.816 A:middle
Look.

00:34:05.826 --> 00:34:06.816 A:middle
We can see that the light

00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:08.016 A:middle
reflects on the screen and

00:34:08.016 --> 00:34:09.505 A:middle
shines off the curved surface,

00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.085 A:middle
and if we turn it to the side,

00:34:11.335 --> 00:34:12.416 A:middle
we can see the color of the

00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:13.596 A:middle
screen there as well where the

00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:15.346 A:middle
glass as some grime to it.

00:34:16.716 --> 00:34:18.255 A:middle
We achieve this by using this

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.235 A:middle
kind of texture for our screen.

00:34:20.235 --> 00:34:21.426 A:middle
It's pretty simple.

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:22.536 A:middle
It's just adding that small

00:34:22.536 --> 00:34:23.126 A:middle
amount of dirt.

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:24.666 A:middle
But crucially, it has the

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:25.866 A:middle
transparency in its alpha

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:27.146 A:middle
channel to indicate that the

00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:28.346 A:middle
screen is see-through, and we

00:34:28.346 --> 00:34:29.916 A:middle
can see the main screen behind

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:29.983 A:middle
it.

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:33.906 A:middle
When you are setting up the

00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:35.775 A:middle
textures for these individual

00:34:35.775 --> 00:34:36.326 A:middle
properties.

00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:37.556 A:middle
These are the formats to use.

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:41.166 A:middle
Albedo should RGB, or RBGA, if

00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:41.815 A:middle
you're also providing

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:42.476 A:middle
transparency.

00:34:43.126 --> 00:34:44.646 A:middle
Normal and emissive should also

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:45.146 A:middle
be RGB.

00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:47.496 A:middle
And metallic roughness and

00:34:47.496 --> 00:34:48.466 A:middle
ambient occlusion should be

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:48.876 A:middle
Greyscale.

00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:51.896 A:middle
You can use any image format

00:34:51.896 --> 00:34:54.246 A:middle
supported on iOS, and note that

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:55.676 A:middle
these textures should be square.

00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:56.856 A:middle
They should be powers of 2

00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:57.266 A:middle
squared.

00:34:57.266 --> 00:35:04.146 A:middle
So, 2k, 1k, 512 pixels, so on.
