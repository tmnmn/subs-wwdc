00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:00.816 A:middle
option, followed by the name of

00:40:00.816 --> 00:40:02.216 A:middle
one of the groups, a mesh or a

00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:03.506 A:middle
submesh that we want to map them

00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:05.356 A:middle
to, and then we can provide any

00:40:05.356 --> 00:40:06.706 A:middle
number of these textures for

00:40:06.706 --> 00:40:07.456 A:middle
that particular group.

00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:10.326 A:middle
To map multiple textures to

00:40:10.326 --> 00:40:12.036 A:middle
multiple groups, we can use the

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:13.586 A:middle
-g option multiple times, as

00:40:13.586 --> 00:40:15.126 A:middle
many as we need, to map all the

00:40:15.126 --> 00:40:15.886 A:middle
textures in our model.

00:40:16.426 --> 00:40:18.406 A:middle
And if you're not sure what the

00:40:18.406 --> 00:40:19.646 A:middle
groups in your model are called,

00:40:20.246 --> 00:40:22.026 A:middle
you can pass in the -v option

00:40:22.026 --> 00:40:23.176 A:middle
for verbose output.

00:40:23.486 --> 00:40:24.496 A:middle
This will print the names of the

00:40:24.496 --> 00:40:26.016 A:middle
groups that we find in the model

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:27.596 A:middle
plus useful other information

00:40:27.596 --> 00:40:28.636 A:middle
about the conversion process.

00:40:31.096 --> 00:40:32.696 A:middle
In addition to making your own

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:34.536 A:middle
models, we've also put together

00:40:34.536 --> 00:40:36.546 A:middle
a gallery of example models that

00:40:36.546 --> 00:40:37.826 A:middle
show good practices for PBR.

00:40:37.826 --> 00:40:40.546 A:middle
If you visit this gallery in an

00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:42.706 A:middle
iOS 12 device, you can tap any

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.306 A:middle
of these models, open them in AR

00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:45.616 A:middle
Quick Look, and place them in

00:40:45.616 --> 00:40:45.936 A:middle
the world.

00:40:46.926 --> 00:40:48.856 A:middle
This gallery also showcases the

00:40:48.976 --> 00:40:50.186 A:middle
Safari integration that David

00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:50.946 A:middle
showed you earlier on.

00:40:51.566 --> 00:40:53.436 A:middle
So, if you have iOS 12 on a

00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:54.706 A:middle
device, visit

00:40:54.706 --> 00:40:57.966 A:middle
develop@apple.com/arkit/gallery

00:40:58.336 --> 00:41:01.816 A:middle
and give them a try.
