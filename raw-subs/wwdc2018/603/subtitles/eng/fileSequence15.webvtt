00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.356 A:middle
presented full screen.

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:02.506 A:middle
To share the same consistent

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:04.166 A:middle
experience with AR Quick Look, I

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:05.316 A:middle
recommend you configure your

00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:06.336 A:middle
Quick Look PreviewController's

00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:08.426 A:middle
appearance to have the same zoom

00:15:08.426 --> 00:15:09.346 A:middle
transition animation.

00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:11.576 A:middle
So when the file's up, you can

00:15:11.576 --> 00:15:12.646 A:middle
see the nice transition from the

00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:16.096 A:middle
thumbnail view to the viewer and

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.576 A:middle
back down as it goes down for

00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:17.986 A:middle
dismissal.

00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:21.616 A:middle
In code, the easiest and

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:22.796 A:middle
recommended way to achieve this

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.196 A:middle
effect is to implement

00:15:24.636 --> 00:15:26.276 A:middle
PreviewController, controller

00:15:26.506 --> 00:15:28.546 A:middle
transitionViewfor item and

00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:29.476 A:middle
return a UIView.

00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:31.986 A:middle
So, Quick Look does all of the

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:33.926 A:middle
heavy work here for you and uses

00:15:33.926 --> 00:15:35.466 A:middle
the UIView to infer the

00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:36.546 A:middle
rectangular frame that the

00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:38.276 A:middle
animation should start from when

00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:40.816 A:middle
presenting and ending when

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:41.276 A:middle
dismissing.

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:44.206 A:middle
If possible, I suggest the final

00:15:44.436 --> 00:15:46.126 A:middle
or UIView to have a square

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:48.436 A:middle
frame, to have the best seamless

00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:48.926 A:middle
transition.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.746 A:middle
AR Quick Look nicely handles the

00:15:51.746 --> 00:15:53.506 A:middle
transition from this view to the

00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:54.606 A:middle
full screen viewer on

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:56.696 A:middle
presentation and dismissal,

00:15:57.086 --> 00:15:58.356 A:middle
creating this effect where the

00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.166 A:middle
model just magically appears.
