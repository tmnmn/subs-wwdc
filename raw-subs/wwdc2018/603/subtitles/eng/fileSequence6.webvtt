00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
on-screen controls and iPhone X,

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.326 A:middle
we hide the home indicator.

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
So, you can go ahead and rotate

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.246 A:middle
the objects using your standard

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:09.516 A:middle
iOS rotation gestures.

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:11.396 A:middle
You can scale the object down

00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:13.406 A:middle
using your two-finger pinch and

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.516 A:middle
scale it larger if you want it

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:15.346 A:middle
to be a lot cuter.

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:17.246 A:middle
And so, you can see that

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
animation there where the purple

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.856 A:middle
aardvark is just fixing all my

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:23.076 A:middle
bugs and just slurping them up.

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:24.156 A:middle
So, I can go ahead and

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:25.356 A:middle
double-tap to reset the size

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:27.776 A:middle
back to 100%, and you can

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:30.256 A:middle
translate the model by just

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:31.576 A:middle
tapping on it and dragging it to

00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:32.636 A:middle
a different place on the table.

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:35.786 A:middle
Or you can tap on it and move

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.616 A:middle
the device around for device

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:39.346 A:middle
movement, really seamless

00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:39.966 A:middle
interactions.

00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:42.446 A:middle
Of course, since this is an AR

00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:43.646 A:middle
experience, we really encourage

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:47.536 A:middle
you to walk around and be really

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:49.946 A:middle
engaged and immerse and see that

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:51.706 A:middle
animation, see the model that's

00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:52.686 A:middle
pushed out into the world.

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:57.476 A:middle
So, we've also provided a

00:06:57.476 --> 00:06:58.346 A:middle
contact shadow.

00:06:58.656 --> 00:06:59.846 A:middle
So, you'll notice right there
