00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.316 A:middle
We can pinch to size an object

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:03.266 A:middle
and make it look a lot larger

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:04.746 A:middle
and really see the fine details

00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:05.626 A:middle
that went into this model.

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:08.506 A:middle
So, you can see how there's

00:05:08.506 --> 00:05:10.196 A:middle
animation baked into this model,

00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:12.186 A:middle
and AR Quick Look supports

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
transform animation and skeletal

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:15.706 A:middle
animation, so the purple

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:17.476 A:middle
aardvark is really lively and

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:18.536 A:middle
animated with personality.

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:21.596 A:middle
And just like a photo, you can

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.846 A:middle
double tap on the model to

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:24.206 A:middle
recess the position and the

00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:24.576 A:middle
size.

00:05:25.246 --> 00:05:27.346 A:middle
But of course, the beauty really

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:29.056 A:middle
comes from pushing my purple

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:30.246 A:middle
aardvark into the world.

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:34.656 A:middle
So, I'll tap on the AR tab, and

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
there, the purple aardvark is in

00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:36.936 A:middle
the world.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:40.366 A:middle
And so we were able to place the

00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:42.836 A:middle
model so quickly into the world

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.066 A:middle
because we started the AR

00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:45.966 A:middle
session the moment AR Quick Look

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:47.726 A:middle
was launched, and we gathered

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:48.846 A:middle
all the feature points of the

00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:50.386 A:middle
environment and pushed the

00:05:50.386 --> 00:05:51.416 A:middle
objects quickly out into the

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:51.736 A:middle
world.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.116 A:middle
So, right here, you can notice

00:05:55.116 --> 00:05:56.676 A:middle
that the controls are hidden for

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:58.066 A:middle
a full immersive experience.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.376 A:middle
Controls like the status bar,

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
on-screen controls and iPhone X,
