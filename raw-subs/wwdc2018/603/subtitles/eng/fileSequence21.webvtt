00:20:57.646 --> 00:21:00.126 A:middle
add its contact shadow, modify

00:21:00.126 --> 00:21:02.096 A:middle
its appearance, and then add any

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.256 A:middle
transparency that our model

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:03.706 A:middle
needs.

00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:05.676 A:middle
Once these six things are done,

00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:07.666 A:middle
we can optimize and export our

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:10.126 A:middle
models for use in AR Quick Look.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.836 A:middle
We'll start with placement, and

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.236 A:middle
there are three things we need

00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:15.936 A:middle
to get right in our 3D software

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:17.076 A:middle
to make our model appear

00:21:17.076 --> 00:21:17.846 A:middle
correctly in the world.

00:21:19.226 --> 00:21:20.536 A:middle
The first is that the object

00:21:20.536 --> 00:21:21.916 A:middle
should face toward the camera,

00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:23.046 A:middle
toward positive z.

00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:25.986 A:middle
Secondly, the base of the object

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:27.406 A:middle
should sit on the ground plane,

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:29.096 A:middle
the plane where y = 0.

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:31.566 A:middle
And finally, we should put its

00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:33.186 A:middle
natural pivot point at the

00:21:33.186 --> 00:21:33.576 A:middle
origin.

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:36.216 A:middle
So, let's see how that looks for

00:21:36.216 --> 00:21:36.896 A:middle
a sample model.

00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:38.896 A:middle
Here, I'm in my 3D modeling

00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:39.326 A:middle
software.

00:21:39.936 --> 00:21:41.426 A:middle
I have the origin at the center.

00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:43.876 A:middle
I have positive x heading off to

00:21:43.876 --> 00:21:46.186 A:middle
the side, positive y heading up

00:21:46.186 --> 00:21:48.216 A:middle
from the origin, and positive z

00:21:48.296 --> 00:21:51.166 A:middle
toward the camera.

00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:52.706 A:middle
Now, if I import a model, if I

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:54.186 A:middle
import my teapot without having

00:21:54.186 --> 00:21:55.936 A:middle
set it up, we can immediately

00:21:55.936 --> 00:21:56.936 A:middle
see there's a problem here.

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.126 A:middle
The model is below the ground

00:21:59.156 --> 00:21:59.326 A:middle
plane.
