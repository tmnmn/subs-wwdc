00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:01.656 A:middle
just sitting on the edge, this

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:03.176 A:middle
tells you that the purple

00:07:03.176 --> 00:07:04.696 A:middle
aardvark is grounded and placed

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.096 A:middle
on that table in the world.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.406 A:middle
And what makes the aardvark look

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.096 A:middle
so amazing right now is that

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:10.966 A:middle
we're matching the color

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:12.206 A:middle
intensity and the temperature

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:13.516 A:middle
that's reported by ARKit from

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.036 A:middle
the world, and we're using that

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:15.946 A:middle
with our lighting setup.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.426 A:middle
So, I think this is really

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:19.886 A:middle
amazing.

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:21.226 A:middle
I want to remember this moment.

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:22.366 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:23.646 A:middle
tap to show the controls.

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:25.686 A:middle
I'm going to take a snapshot of

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:25.976 A:middle
this.

00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:29.546 A:middle
So, right here, I'm going to go

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:30.796 A:middle
ahead and mark up the moment,

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:37.036 A:middle
and this is really amazing, so I

00:07:37.036 --> 00:07:38.126 A:middle
can save this later and take a

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:38.616 A:middle
look at this.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.046 A:middle
But with AR Quick Look, we

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:46.476 A:middle
really wanted to make AR

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:48.506 A:middle
accessible to everyone, and we

00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:49.596 A:middle
do mean everyone.

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:51.396 A:middle
Accessibility is one of our core

00:07:51.396 --> 00:07:53.536 A:middle
values, and so we made AR Quick

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:55.166 A:middle
Look work with VoiceOver and

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:55.646 A:middle
switch control.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:56.816 A:middle
So, let me show you the

00:07:56.816 --> 00:07:57.826 A:middle
VoiceOver flow right now.

00:07:58.606 --> 00:07:59.406 A:middle
So, I'll triple click the home

00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:00.676 A:middle
button to activate VoiceOver.
