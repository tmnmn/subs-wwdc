&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone, and

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:30.656 A:middle
welcome to Integrating Apps and

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.016 A:middle
Content with AR Quick Look.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.176 A:middle
My name is David Lui, and I'm so

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:35.446 A:middle
excited to talk to you about AR

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:35.926 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:37.936 A:middle
As you all saw yesterday at the

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.976 A:middle
Keynote, we brought this new

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:41.726 A:middle
capability of previewing 3D

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:44.476 A:middle
models in AR space throughout

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:45.606 A:middle
iOS.

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:47.436 A:middle
AR is becoming the tool to see

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:48.886 A:middle
what objects look like in the

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.096 A:middle
world, from a new sofa you're

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:52.376 A:middle
purchasing for your living room

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:54.386 A:middle
to that cute animated character

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.766 A:middle
you're reading about in your

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:57.016 A:middle
book.

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:58.546 A:middle
AR Quick Look was designed to

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.676 A:middle
enrich any application on the OS
