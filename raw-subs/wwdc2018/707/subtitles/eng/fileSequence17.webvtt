00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:00.056 A:middle
running, the sensors will also

00:17:00.056 --> 00:17:02.086 A:middle
be ready to track the activity,

00:17:02.886 --> 00:17:04.695 A:middle
but the workout has not started

00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:04.866 A:middle
yet.

00:17:06.156 --> 00:17:08.236 A:middle
So if you, for example, have a

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.435 A:middle
countdown in your app before a

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:12.576 A:middle
workout, you can move the

00:17:12.576 --> 00:17:14.195 A:middle
session to the Prepared state

00:17:14.195 --> 00:17:16.016 A:middle
before that to make sure that

00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:17.925 A:middle
the device is ready to start

00:17:17.925 --> 00:17:18.776 A:middle
tracking the activity.

00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:22.236 A:middle
After that, we can move to the

00:17:22.236 --> 00:17:22.996 A:middle
Running state.

00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:26.366 A:middle
And here, the user is actively

00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:26.876 A:middle
working out.

00:17:27.386 --> 00:17:29.406 A:middle
And of course, the user can move

00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:31.946 A:middle
to the Paused, back to Running,

00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:33.766 A:middle
and back and forth between these

00:17:33.766 --> 00:17:37.596 A:middle
2 until the workout is Stopped.

00:17:38.236 --> 00:17:42.016 A:middle
So here, the device is still in

00:17:42.016 --> 00:17:43.616 A:middle
Session Mode, which means that

00:17:43.616 --> 00:17:45.716 A:middle
your app is still running in the

00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:47.706 A:middle
background, so that gives you

00:17:47.706 --> 00:17:49.486 A:middle
some extra time that, if you

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.066 A:middle
needed to save the workout.

00:17:51.576 --> 00:17:54.846 A:middle
After that, we can simply end

00:17:54.846 --> 00:17:55.366 A:middle
the workout.

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:58.656 A:middle
And from there, the system will

00:17:58.716 --> 00:17:59.606 A:middle
exit Session Mode.
