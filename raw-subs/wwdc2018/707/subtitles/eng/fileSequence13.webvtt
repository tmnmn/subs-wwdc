00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.026 A:middle
And wouldn't it be cool if we

00:13:01.056 --> 00:13:03.106 A:middle
could have all of this data

00:13:03.876 --> 00:13:05.896 A:middle
automatically collected by the

00:13:05.896 --> 00:13:06.306 A:middle
builder?

00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:10.706 A:middle
Starting with watchOS 5, we now

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:13.856 A:middle
have automatic data collection,

00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:15.776 A:middle
and it all starts with

00:13:15.776 --> 00:13:17.856 A:middle
HKLiveWorkoutDataSource.

00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:22.086 A:middle
So the data source will collect

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:25.346 A:middle
samples that are relevant to the

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.136 A:middle
workout currently running.

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:32.756 A:middle
You do, however, have the option

00:13:33.316 --> 00:13:34.676 A:middle
which types you want to collect,

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:37.996 A:middle
so you can add or remove types

00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:38.556 A:middle
as you wish.

00:13:39.266 --> 00:13:40.596 A:middle
And this is how it works.

00:13:41.456 --> 00:13:43.796 A:middle
First, we create a data source.

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:46.896 A:middle
And here, I pass the healthStore

00:13:47.386 --> 00:13:48.586 A:middle
as well as the

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:49.836 A:middle
workoutConfiguration.

00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:51.246 A:middle
And since I'm passing the

00:13:51.246 --> 00:13:52.636 A:middle
configuration that contains

00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:54.696 A:middle
information about the activity

00:13:54.696 --> 00:13:56.816 A:middle
type, the data source will be

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:59.806 A:middle
able to infer which types should

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:03.136 A:middle
be collected for this workout.
