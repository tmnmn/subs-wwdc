00:28:59.076 --> 00:29:00.726 A:middle
and pass the workout's end date.

00:29:01.836 --> 00:29:03.496 A:middle
And from there, we're just going

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:05.276 A:middle
to call finishWorkout to

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.266 A:middle
actually save the workout and

00:29:07.326 --> 00:29:08.826 A:middle
all of its associated data in

00:29:08.826 --> 00:29:09.236 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:29:10.336 --> 00:29:11.476 A:middle
And then, we just dismissed it

00:29:11.476 --> 00:29:11.656 A:middle
here.

00:29:12.486 --> 00:29:13.856 A:middle
So let's go ahead and run this

00:29:13.856 --> 00:29:16.506 A:middle
code and see what happens now.

00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:25.456 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:29:25.456 --> 00:29:27.116 A:middle
start my workout here.

00:29:28.326 --> 00:29:31.086 A:middle
And as we see now, I have my

00:29:31.086 --> 00:29:32.796 A:middle
timer updating.

00:29:33.226 --> 00:29:35.536 A:middle
I have data directly collected

00:29:35.536 --> 00:29:37.676 A:middle
by the builder and displayed

00:29:37.826 --> 00:29:39.416 A:middle
right in my user interface.

00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:42.886 A:middle
And of course, I can also react

00:29:42.886 --> 00:29:45.116 A:middle
to the state changes, so going

00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:47.616 A:middle
to go ahead and pause the

00:29:47.616 --> 00:29:48.176 A:middle
workout.

00:29:49.436 --> 00:29:50.606 A:middle
My timer has paused.

00:29:51.116 --> 00:29:52.396 A:middle
Data collection as well.

00:29:53.086 --> 00:29:54.606 A:middle
I can resume.

00:29:55.186 --> 00:29:58.996 A:middle
And just like that, with a few

00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:00.866 A:middle
lines of code, I now have a
