00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:02.706 A:middle
beginCollection and pass a start

00:11:02.706 --> 00:11:02.926 A:middle
date.

00:11:04.076 --> 00:11:04.896 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:09.046 A:middle
If you are on watchOS, you can

00:11:09.046 --> 00:11:10.676 A:middle
use the live workout builder.

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:13.266 A:middle
And so first, you need to create

00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:15.946 A:middle
a workout session by passing the

00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:16.766 A:middle
healthStore and

00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:19.386 A:middle
workoutConfiguration, and then

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:21.576 A:middle
you do not create the builder

00:11:21.576 --> 00:11:23.386 A:middle
yourself, but you retrieve it

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:25.876 A:middle
directly from the session by

00:11:25.876 --> 00:11:26.626 A:middle
using this call.

00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:29.156 A:middle
Once we have the session and

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:30.936 A:middle
builder, we can go ahead and

00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:32.146 A:middle
start them up.

00:11:32.736 --> 00:11:35.006 A:middle
And so it's as easy as calling

00:11:35.006 --> 00:11:37.466 A:middle
startActivity on the session and

00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:39.416 A:middle
beginCollection on the builder

00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:41.236 A:middle
by passing a start date.

00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:45.376 A:middle
So this is how you set up and

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:47.496 A:middle
start a workout using the

00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:47.876 A:middle
builder.

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:49.996 A:middle
Now, let's see how we can

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.666 A:middle
collect data displayed directly

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:56.576 A:middle
in our user interface and be

00:11:56.576 --> 00:11:58.116 A:middle
able to control the state of the

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:00.036 A:middle
workout when the user requests
