00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.306 A:middle
You can see calories, exercise

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:00.646 A:middle
minutes.

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:02.786 A:middle
And Health is all of that and

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:03.156 A:middle
more.

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.666 A:middle
And of course, at the heart of

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:06.956 A:middle
all of that, which is the reason

00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:08.716 A:middle
we're here today, is HealthKit.

00:02:10.186 --> 00:02:12.286 A:middle
And so we have a ton of exciting

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:13.976 A:middle
things to talk about today, but

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:15.346 A:middle
before we get started with any

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:16.566 A:middle
of that, we have to talk about

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:17.946 A:middle
something extremely important,

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:19.676 A:middle
and that is privacy and

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:21.796 A:middle
authorization, because data is

00:02:21.796 --> 00:02:23.446 A:middle
sensitive, especially health

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:25.146 A:middle
data, and it is so important to

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:26.426 A:middle
make sure that you have a

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:28.516 A:middle
comprehensive privacy story when

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.676 A:middle
working with your apps.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.836 A:middle
Next, Karim is going to share

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:34.366 A:middle
our brand-new workout features,

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:36.026 A:middle
which have made it easier than

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:38.146 A:middle
ever before to develop a robust

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.026 A:middle
workout app.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:41.216 A:middle
And lastly, I'm so excited to

00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:42.656 A:middle
share our new Quantity series

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:44.646 A:middle
API, which is a brand-new way to

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:46.256 A:middle
both store and relate

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:47.346 A:middle
high-frequency data.

00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:49.716 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:53.946 A:middle
Like I mentioned, privacy and

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.636 A:middle
authorization has to come at the

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:57.596 A:middle
beginning of any development

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:57.886 A:middle
story.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.656 A:middle
And at Apple, we think about

00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:02.796 A:middle
privacy in 1 simple way: Privacy
