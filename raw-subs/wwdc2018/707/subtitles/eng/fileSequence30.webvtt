00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:00.866 A:middle
lines of code, I now have a

00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.576 A:middle
fully functional workout app.

00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:08.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:09.116 --> 00:30:11.416 A:middle
So I'm going to stop the workout

00:30:12.086 --> 00:30:16.346 A:middle
now, and let's see what we have

00:30:16.436 --> 00:30:18.986 A:middle
just saved in the health app on

00:30:19.266 --> 00:30:19.766 A:middle
the iPhone.

00:30:20.366 --> 00:30:25.196 A:middle
So this is my workout here that

00:30:25.196 --> 00:30:27.576 A:middle
I have just saved, and we have

00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:30.316 A:middle
now a very rich representation

00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:32.846 A:middle
of this workout saved directly

00:30:32.846 --> 00:30:33.376 A:middle
in HealthKit.

00:30:33.996 --> 00:30:36.286 A:middle
I have the device details as

00:30:36.286 --> 00:30:37.916 A:middle
well as all of the samples that

00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:39.476 A:middle
were associated, like heart

00:30:39.476 --> 00:30:42.066 A:middle
rate, distance, and active

00:30:42.066 --> 00:30:44.546 A:middle
energy, and, also, the workout

00:30:44.636 --> 00:30:46.816 A:middle
events that were generated when

00:30:46.816 --> 00:30:48.256 A:middle
I paused and resumed the

00:30:48.256 --> 00:30:48.666 A:middle
session.

00:30:57.386 --> 00:30:59.676 A:middle
And that's how easy it is now to

00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:02.056 A:middle
build a full-featured workout
