00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:03.126 A:middle
And to be able to move between

00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:05.356 A:middle
all these states, you simply

00:18:05.356 --> 00:18:08.166 A:middle
need to use these calls directly

00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:09.256 A:middle
on the workout session.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.916 A:middle
So that's how we can collect

00:18:16.966 --> 00:18:18.926 A:middle
data displayed in our user

00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:21.286 A:middle
interface as well as control the

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:22.356 A:middle
state of the session.

00:18:23.296 --> 00:18:25.256 A:middle
Let's see now how we can end the

00:18:25.256 --> 00:18:26.786 A:middle
workout and save it in

00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:27.176 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:18:27.726 --> 00:18:32.066 A:middle
So to end the workout, you first

00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:35.366 A:middle
call session.end, and then you

00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:37.066 A:middle
also call builder.

00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:39.256 A:middle
endCollection and pass the

00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:40.246 A:middle
workout's end date.

00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:43.066 A:middle
At this point, no data is going

00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:44.746 A:middle
to be collected for this

00:18:44.966 --> 00:18:45.356 A:middle
workout.

00:18:45.906 --> 00:18:48.546 A:middle
And then, if you want to save

00:18:48.546 --> 00:18:50.176 A:middle
the workout in HealthKit, you

00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:51.336 A:middle
just call builder.

00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:54.706 A:middle
finishWorkout, and you will get

00:18:54.706 --> 00:18:56.946 A:middle
back a workout object in the

00:18:56.946 --> 00:18:58.576 A:middle
completion handler that's

00:18:58.626 --> 00:19:00.586 A:middle
already saved in HealthKit with
