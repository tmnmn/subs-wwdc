00:19:59.586 --> 00:20:00.156 A:middle
in the workout.

00:20:00.706 --> 00:20:02.586 A:middle
Of course, my user will have the

00:20:02.586 --> 00:20:04.686 A:middle
option to control the state of

00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:06.526 A:middle
the workout, so my user can

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:08.666 A:middle
pause, resume, and end the

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:09.036 A:middle
workout.

00:20:11.716 --> 00:20:14.326 A:middle
So I already went ahead and

00:20:14.326 --> 00:20:16.066 A:middle
implemented the user interface.

00:20:16.446 --> 00:20:18.626 A:middle
So all that's left for me now is

00:20:18.656 --> 00:20:20.646 A:middle
to use the new workout API and

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.366 A:middle
make my app functional.

00:20:22.916 --> 00:20:25.706 A:middle
And the first thing that we need

00:20:25.706 --> 00:20:27.796 A:middle
to do here is make sure that the

00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:29.596 A:middle
project is properly set up.

00:20:30.486 --> 00:20:31.786 A:middle
And so to do that, I'm going to

00:20:31.786 --> 00:20:32.886 A:middle
head over to my Project

00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:35.596 A:middle
Settings, go to the Capabilities

00:20:35.596 --> 00:20:37.916 A:middle
tab, and here just make sure

00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:40.376 A:middle
that the HealthKit Capability is

00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:40.906 A:middle
turned on.

00:20:42.126 --> 00:20:43.716 A:middle
And you should also do the same

00:20:44.006 --> 00:20:46.026 A:middle
for your WatchKit app extension.

00:20:46.336 --> 00:20:48.236 A:middle
So again, make sure that the

00:20:48.236 --> 00:20:50.196 A:middle
HealthKit Capability is turned

00:20:50.196 --> 00:20:50.366 A:middle
on.

00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:53.646 A:middle
Once I did that, we should also

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:56.566 A:middle
add the 2 purpose strings in the

00:20:56.566 --> 00:20:59.246 A:middle
info.plist file that will tell

00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:01.966 A:middle
my users why I need access to
