00:34:59.106 --> 00:35:00.316 A:middle
data visualization.

00:35:00.366 --> 00:35:02.086 A:middle
Your app requires complex

00:35:02.086 --> 00:35:04.026 A:middle
charting or graphs, and you're

00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:05.426 A:middle
trying to really visualize the

00:35:05.426 --> 00:35:06.886 A:middle
data that your users have in a

00:35:06.886 --> 00:35:07.616 A:middle
beautiful way.

00:35:08.426 --> 00:35:09.826 A:middle
We actually suggest that you

00:35:09.826 --> 00:35:11.026 A:middle
continue using our

00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:13.226 A:middle
HKStatisticsQuery or our

00:35:13.226 --> 00:35:15.046 A:middle
HKStatistics CollectionQuery.

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.526 A:middle
And that's because those are

00:35:16.526 --> 00:35:18.886 A:middle
preexisting queries that do just

00:35:18.886 --> 00:35:19.186 A:middle
this.

00:35:19.336 --> 00:35:20.796 A:middle
You have access to really

00:35:20.906 --> 00:35:23.266 A:middle
fine-grained, rich data, and

00:35:23.266 --> 00:35:24.866 A:middle
these queries will already get

00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:26.916 A:middle
the fine-grained data on our new

00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.586 A:middle
series samples, so you won't

00:35:28.586 --> 00:35:30.366 A:middle
have to do any extra work to get

00:35:30.426 --> 00:35:31.136 A:middle
those details.

00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:33.606 A:middle
If, for example, you're

00:35:33.606 --> 00:35:35.646 A:middle
interested in data analysis, you

00:35:35.646 --> 00:35:37.156 A:middle
want to go 1 step deeper.

00:35:37.246 --> 00:35:38.456 A:middle
You want to understand the

00:35:38.456 --> 00:35:40.096 A:middle
actual quantities that make up a

00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:40.576 A:middle
sample.

00:35:41.426 --> 00:35:44.046 A:middle
We suggest you use our new

00:35:44.046 --> 00:35:45.276 A:middle
series sample query.

00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:47.736 A:middle
And lastly, if you're like me

00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:48.906 A:middle
and have a soccer app [laughs]

00:35:48.906 --> 00:35:50.866 A:middle
or any app that has really

00:35:50.866 --> 00:35:52.396 A:middle
high-frequency data collection,

00:35:53.126 --> 00:35:54.666 A:middle
we suggest that you use our new

00:35:54.666 --> 00:35:56.226 A:middle
Quantity series sample builder,

00:35:56.486 --> 00:35:57.746 A:middle
which is a brand-new way for you

00:35:57.746 --> 00:35:59.096 A:middle
to actually be able to create

00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:00.556 A:middle
those new cumulative Quantity
