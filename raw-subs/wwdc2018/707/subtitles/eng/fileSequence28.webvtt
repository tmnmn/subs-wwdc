00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:01.336 A:middle
contains information like

00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:04.046 A:middle
minimum, maximum, average, and

00:28:04.046 --> 00:28:05.876 A:middle
most recent values for each

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:06.826 A:middle
type.

00:28:07.656 --> 00:28:09.716 A:middle
So I grab the statistics object

00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:12.986 A:middle
here, and from there, I have a

00:28:12.986 --> 00:28:13.916 A:middle
method that I already

00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:15.886 A:middle
implemented that will give me

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:17.976 A:middle
the user interface label for

00:28:17.976 --> 00:28:19.556 A:middle
this particular quantity type.

00:28:20.696 --> 00:28:22.156 A:middle
And from there, it just update

00:28:22.536 --> 00:28:24.716 A:middle
my label using the statistics

00:28:24.716 --> 00:28:25.106 A:middle
object.

00:28:25.776 --> 00:28:29.046 A:middle
Next, let's make sure that we

00:28:29.046 --> 00:28:30.886 A:middle
can control the state when the

00:28:30.886 --> 00:28:32.526 A:middle
user requests it.

00:28:33.216 --> 00:28:35.876 A:middle
So every time my user will tap

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:37.376 A:middle
the Pause button, this method

00:28:37.376 --> 00:28:38.386 A:middle
here will be called.

00:28:39.066 --> 00:28:40.486 A:middle
And from there, I simply need to

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:42.646 A:middle
call session.pause.

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:45.716 A:middle
For resume, it's very similar.

00:28:46.346 --> 00:28:48.626 A:middle
I'm going to do session.resume.

00:28:49.176 --> 00:28:52.376 A:middle
And finally, to end the workout,

00:28:53.176 --> 00:28:55.126 A:middle
we're going to call session.end

00:28:56.006 --> 00:28:58.936 A:middle
and then builder.endCollection

00:28:59.076 --> 00:29:00.726 A:middle
and pass the workout's end date.
