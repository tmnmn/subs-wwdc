00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:02.126 A:middle
builder, but because it's on

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:04.226 A:middle
watchOS and it works closely

00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:06.676 A:middle
with HKWorkoutSession, it has

00:10:06.736 --> 00:10:08.106 A:middle
all of these really cool

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:10.956 A:middle
features like automatic sample

00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:12.786 A:middle
and event collection, which

00:10:12.786 --> 00:10:13.776 A:middle
we'll talk about later.

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:18.006 A:middle
So let's go back to the workout

00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:21.136 A:middle
app life cycle, and we'll see

00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:23.206 A:middle
how we can now set up and start

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.186 A:middle
the workout using the new

00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:25.986 A:middle
workout builder.

00:10:29.456 --> 00:10:31.936 A:middle
So first, we need to create a

00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:32.736 A:middle
workout builder.

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:34.956 A:middle
And to do that, we use the

00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:37.356 A:middle
initializer, and we have to pass

00:10:37.356 --> 00:10:39.526 A:middle
a healthStore object, a

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.666 A:middle
configuration which contains

00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:43.646 A:middle
information like the workout

00:10:43.646 --> 00:10:45.656 A:middle
type, whether it's indoor or

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:47.796 A:middle
outdoor, and other information.

00:10:48.616 --> 00:10:51.156 A:middle
And finally, an optional device

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:53.546 A:middle
if the data comes from an

00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:54.906 A:middle
external device, for example.

00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:58.946 A:middle
Once my builder is created, all

00:10:58.946 --> 00:10:59.996 A:middle
I need to do is call

00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:02.706 A:middle
beginCollection and pass a start
