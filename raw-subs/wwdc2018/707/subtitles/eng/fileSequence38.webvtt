00:37:59.596 --> 00:38:00.946 A:middle
implemented our new Quantity

00:38:01.036 --> 00:38:02.746 A:middle
series APIs in your apps because

00:38:02.746 --> 00:38:04.376 A:middle
it's a brand-new way to store

00:38:04.376 --> 00:38:06.086 A:middle
your data more efficiently, and

00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:07.726 A:middle
its ability to be able to relate

00:38:07.726 --> 00:38:09.536 A:middle
data together really allows for

00:38:09.536 --> 00:38:10.866 A:middle
some interesting analysis.

00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:16.576 A:middle
So we have talked about a lot of

00:38:16.576 --> 00:38:18.466 A:middle
interesting things, and we think

00:38:18.466 --> 00:38:19.876 A:middle
that the best way to think about

00:38:19.876 --> 00:38:21.436 A:middle
them is actually as parts of a

00:38:21.436 --> 00:38:23.246 A:middle
whole because together they

00:38:23.246 --> 00:38:24.996 A:middle
really make up a way for you to

00:38:24.996 --> 00:38:26.666 A:middle
respect your users' user

00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:28.666 A:middle
experience from start to finish.

00:38:29.296 --> 00:38:31.396 A:middle
Of course, we have to start with

00:38:31.396 --> 00:38:32.716 A:middle
respecting user privacy.

00:38:32.986 --> 00:38:35.496 A:middle
Our users are giving access to

00:38:35.496 --> 00:38:36.496 A:middle
one of their most sensitive

00:38:36.496 --> 00:38:38.706 A:middle
data, and it is so important for

00:38:38.706 --> 00:38:39.756 A:middle
us to make sure that we're

00:38:39.756 --> 00:38:41.046 A:middle
treating it with the respect

00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:41.746 A:middle
that it deserves.

00:38:42.616 --> 00:38:44.836 A:middle
Next, with the brand-new workout

00:38:44.836 --> 00:38:46.466 A:middle
features Karim mentioned, we're

00:38:46.466 --> 00:38:48.076 A:middle
able to create seamless user

00:38:48.076 --> 00:38:48.806 A:middle
experiences.

00:38:49.216 --> 00:38:50.626 A:middle
With things like workout crash

00:38:50.626 --> 00:38:52.376 A:middle
recovery, we're able to really

00:38:52.376 --> 00:38:54.106 A:middle
deliver an experience to our

00:38:54.106 --> 00:38:55.636 A:middle
users that they expect.

00:38:56.326 --> 00:38:58.426 A:middle
And lastly, by implementing our

00:38:58.426 --> 00:39:00.456 A:middle
new Quantity series APIs, you're
