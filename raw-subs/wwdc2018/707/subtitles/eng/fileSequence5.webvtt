00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.186 A:middle
declare that I'm going to be

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:02.156 A:middle
sharing the workout type.

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.376 A:middle
Next, since I'm just getting

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:05.946 A:middle
started, I only have a few

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:07.586 A:middle
things that I'm trying to track.

00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:08.666 A:middle
I want to be able to track my

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.876 A:middle
user's heart rate, calories, as

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.246 A:middle
well as distance walking and

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:12.586 A:middle
running.

00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
And this is all I need right

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:16.326 A:middle
now, and so that's all I'm going

00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:17.856 A:middle
to ask for.

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:19.856 A:middle
And lastly, on my healthStore, I

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:21.526 A:middle
request authorization for just

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:21.836 A:middle
that.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:23.396 A:middle
I request my types to share and

00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:24.366 A:middle
my types to read.

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:26.586 A:middle
And with these 3 simple steps,

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:27.946 A:middle
we can really make sure that we

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:29.896 A:middle
are taking the steps necessary

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:31.466 A:middle
to respect our user's privacy.

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:35.436 A:middle
And privacy is so important

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:36.966 A:middle
because great apps have great

00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:38.586 A:middle
privacy, and it's so important

00:05:38.586 --> 00:05:39.956 A:middle
that you give attention to this

00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:41.206 A:middle
at the beginning of any

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:42.116 A:middle
development process.

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:44.006 A:middle
And now that we have access to

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:46.476 A:middle
our users' data, I'm so excited

00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:47.726 A:middle
to introduce Karim [phonetic] to

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:49.136 A:middle
tell you all about the brand-new

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:50.036 A:middle
workout features.

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:56.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:56.596 --> 00:05:57.946 A:middle

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:00.466 A:middle
