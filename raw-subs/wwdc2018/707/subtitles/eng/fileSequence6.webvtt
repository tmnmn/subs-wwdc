00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:00.466 A:middle
Thank you so much for joining us

00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:00.736 A:middle
today.

00:06:01.306 --> 00:06:03.256 A:middle
I am really excited to tell you

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:05.246 A:middle
all about the new workout API.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.036 A:middle
If you're new to HealthKit,

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:10.876 A:middle
you'll see just how easy it is

00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:12.896 A:middle
to create a full-featured

00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:14.536 A:middle
workout app from scratch.

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:16.856 A:middle
If, on the other hand, you have

00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:18.486 A:middle
a workout app on the App Store,

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.746 A:middle
we'll show you all of the great

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:22.796 A:middle
new features of the API that

00:06:22.796 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
your app can benefit from.

00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:26.496 A:middle
So let's dive in.

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:29.766 A:middle
First, I would like to take a

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:32.556 A:middle
look at the general workout app

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:33.556 A:middle
life cycle.

00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:35.616 A:middle
So let's say we're building a

00:06:35.766 --> 00:06:37.926 A:middle
workout app to track our users'

00:06:37.926 --> 00:06:41.606 A:middle
activity, and the first step is

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.506 A:middle
to set up the app.

00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:46.146 A:middle
So at this state here, we know

00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:48.086 A:middle
that the user wants to perform a

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:50.586 A:middle
workout, the type of activity,

00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:52.546 A:middle
and we need to make sure that

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:54.556 A:middle
our UI is ready for that.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.596 A:middle
Once the setup is done, we can

00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:00.506 A:middle
go ahead and start the workout.
