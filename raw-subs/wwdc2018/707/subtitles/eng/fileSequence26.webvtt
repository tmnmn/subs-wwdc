00:25:58.586 --> 00:26:00.626 A:middle
the duration, I'm going to have

00:26:00.676 --> 00:26:02.666 A:middle
this call in the builder's

00:26:02.756 --> 00:26:07.776 A:middle
didCollectEvent call as well.

00:26:07.946 --> 00:26:08.916 A:middle
Now, let's implement this

00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:09.206 A:middle
method.

00:26:10.596 --> 00:26:13.246 A:middle
So in my UI, I'm using a

00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:14.826 A:middle
WatchKit interface timer.

00:26:15.386 --> 00:26:16.586 A:middle
If you're not familiar with this

00:26:16.586 --> 00:26:19.916 A:middle
object, this object needs a date

00:26:19.986 --> 00:26:22.166 A:middle
in the past from which it will

00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:23.186 A:middle
start counting from.

00:26:23.786 --> 00:26:24.956 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:26:24.956 --> 00:26:27.696 A:middle
create my date object using the

00:26:27.696 --> 00:26:29.676 A:middle
builder's elapsedTime property.

00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:31.906 A:middle
And because I want the date to

00:26:31.906 --> 00:26:33.496 A:middle
be in the past, I'm going to

00:26:33.796 --> 00:26:35.306 A:middle
make sure that I have a minus

00:26:35.306 --> 00:26:36.956 A:middle
sign here.

00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:39.186 A:middle
Next, I simply dispatch on the

00:26:39.186 --> 00:26:41.476 A:middle
main queue because I'm doing UI

00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.516 A:middle
work, and then I just set the

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:46.606 A:middle
date on the timer.

00:26:46.606 --> 00:26:47.826 A:middle
I also need to make sure that

00:26:47.826 --> 00:26:50.376 A:middle
the timer is only running when

00:26:51.046 --> 00:26:53.076 A:middle
the session is running as well.

00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:54.456 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:26:55.376 --> 00:26:57.506 A:middle
First, I grab the session state,

00:26:58.126 --> 00:26:59.916 A:middle
and then, again, I dispatch on

00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:00.556 A:middle
the main queue.
