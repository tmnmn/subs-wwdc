00:15:58.486 --> 00:16:00.436 A:middle
added to the builder, the

00:16:00.436 --> 00:16:01.756 A:middle
builder's delegate method

00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:04.806 A:middle
workoutBuilderDid CollectEvents

00:16:04.806 --> 00:16:05.436 A:middle
will be called.

00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:08.186 A:middle
And from here, you can simply

00:16:08.186 --> 00:16:10.326 A:middle
use the builder's elapsedTime

00:16:10.326 --> 00:16:12.386 A:middle
property, which will give you

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:14.546 A:middle
the current elapsed time for the

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:14.986 A:middle
workout.

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:19.536 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:16:19.736 --> 00:16:21.616 A:middle
Next, let's see how we can

00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:22.846 A:middle
control the state of the

00:16:22.846 --> 00:16:23.296 A:middle
workout.

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.396 A:middle
So first, I'd like to talk about

00:16:28.506 --> 00:16:30.566 A:middle
all of the different states that

00:16:30.566 --> 00:16:32.136 A:middle
the workout session can be in.

00:16:32.746 --> 00:16:34.976 A:middle
And the first one is Not

00:16:34.976 --> 00:16:35.456 A:middle
Started.

00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:37.576 A:middle
So here, the workout has not

00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:41.356 A:middle
started yet, and we're not yet,

00:16:41.796 --> 00:16:44.056 A:middle
the user is not performing the

00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:44.496 A:middle
workout.

00:16:44.496 --> 00:16:47.136 A:middle
So after that, we'll be moving

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.746 A:middle
to the Prepared state.

00:16:49.246 --> 00:16:52.146 A:middle
And so the Prepared state will

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:54.506 A:middle
put the system in Session Mode,

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.386 A:middle
which means that your

00:16:56.386 --> 00:16:58.026 A:middle
application will have background

00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:00.056 A:middle
running, the sensors will also
