00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:00.556 A:middle
the main queue.

00:27:00.796 --> 00:27:02.606 A:middle
And if the session is running,

00:27:03.076 --> 00:27:04.256 A:middle
I'm going to start the timer.

00:27:04.966 --> 00:27:06.116 A:middle
And if it's not, I'm going to

00:27:06.116 --> 00:27:07.336 A:middle
call Stop on the timer.

00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:09.966 A:middle
And that's all you need to do to

00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:12.176 A:middle
get the timer tracking the

00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:13.786 A:middle
elapsed time.

00:27:13.986 --> 00:27:15.826 A:middle
Next, let's make sure that our

00:27:15.826 --> 00:27:17.566 A:middle
metrics displayed in the UI are

00:27:18.016 --> 00:27:19.036 A:middle
also accurate.

00:27:19.986 --> 00:27:22.246 A:middle
So every time new samples are

00:27:22.246 --> 00:27:24.976 A:middle
collected by the builder, this

00:27:25.016 --> 00:27:26.746 A:middle
method here will be called.

00:27:27.506 --> 00:27:29.366 A:middle
And so here, I'm just going to

00:27:29.366 --> 00:27:31.016 A:middle
go and iterate over the

00:27:31.046 --> 00:27:31.946 A:middle
collectedTypes.

00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:39.016 A:middle
And, in my case, all of the data

00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:41.006 A:middle
that I'm interested in is

00:27:41.236 --> 00:27:42.336 A:middle
quantity samples.

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:44.236 A:middle
So I'm going to make sure that I

00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:45.476 A:middle
only handle those.

00:27:46.006 --> 00:27:49.276 A:middle
And from there, we can make use

00:27:49.276 --> 00:27:53.226 A:middle
of the new builder's method,

00:27:53.636 --> 00:27:55.886 A:middle
builder.statistics, for quantity

00:27:55.886 --> 00:27:57.566 A:middle
types, which will give me an

00:27:57.566 --> 00:27:59.856 A:middle
HKStatistics object that

00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:01.336 A:middle
contains information like
