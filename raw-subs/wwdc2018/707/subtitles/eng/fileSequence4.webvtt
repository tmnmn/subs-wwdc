00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.526 A:middle
For example, if a user resets

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.036 A:middle
their location and privacy data,

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:05.606 A:middle
their location and privacy

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:08.066 A:middle
setting, it is so important for

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:09.566 A:middle
you to make sure you're honoring

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:10.436 A:middle
that, and it is your

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.076 A:middle
responsibility to make sure you

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:12.516 A:middle
do that.

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:14.346 A:middle
And the best way to do this is

00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:15.746 A:middle
to treat HealthKit as the source

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:18.576 A:middle
of truth because HealthKit will

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.236 A:middle
update to reflect that

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:21.946 A:middle
authorization status, and it is

00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:23.126 A:middle
so important to make sure you

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:25.096 A:middle
don't cache any of that and make

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:26.356 A:middle
sure you're always turning to

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:28.336 A:middle
HealthKit to ask what data you

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:29.126 A:middle
have access to.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:31.486 A:middle
And these 2 ideas can be

00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:33.546 A:middle
distilled into 3 simple rules.

00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:35.506 A:middle
And when we're thinking about

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:36.816 A:middle
privacy and authorization, you

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:38.246 A:middle
should ask for only what you

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:40.636 A:middle
need, only when you need it, and

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:43.066 A:middle
every single time you need it.

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.596 A:middle
And in code, this is just as

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:47.066 A:middle
simple.

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:49.306 A:middle
Let's say I'm creating a workout

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:50.336 A:middle
app, and I'm just getting

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:51.876 A:middle
started, and, of course, I need

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.036 A:middle
to start with privacy and

00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:53.776 A:middle
authorization.

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:55.536 A:middle
First, since I'm creating a

00:04:55.536 --> 00:04:57.276 A:middle
workout app, I want to share the

00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.866 A:middle
workout type, so I explicitly

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.186 A:middle
declare that I'm going to be
