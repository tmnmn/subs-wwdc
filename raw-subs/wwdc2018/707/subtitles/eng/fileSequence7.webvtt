00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:00.506 A:middle
go ahead and start the workout.

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.766 A:middle
So after this point, the user

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:06.086 A:middle
will be actively working out.

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.796 A:middle
And then, of course, after some

00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:12.046 A:middle
time, the user will want to end

00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:12.616 A:middle
the workout.

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:15.666 A:middle
And from there, we can save this

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:17.216 A:middle
workout and all of its

00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:19.316 A:middle
associated data in HealthKit.

00:07:20.596 --> 00:07:23.766 A:middle
So this is the general life

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.616 A:middle
cycle of a workout app.

00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:29.116 A:middle
Now, let's see what happens when

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.086 A:middle
the user is active.

00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:34.236 A:middle
With your user interface at the

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.826 A:middle
center, one of the tasks that

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:39.266 A:middle
you want to accomplish is to

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.736 A:middle
collect data that is relevant to

00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:44.096 A:middle
the workout and displayed in

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.376 A:middle
your user interface.

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:47.926 A:middle
And you also want to make sure

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.116 A:middle
that the user can control the

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:52.606 A:middle
state of the session so that the

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.656 A:middle
user can pause or resume the

00:07:54.656 --> 00:07:55.116 A:middle
workout.

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:59.626 A:middle
And if you're familiar with

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:01.726 A:middle
HealthKit, you might know about
