00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:12.876 A:middle
But of course, sometimes things

00:31:12.906 --> 00:31:14.156 A:middle
don't go as planned.

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:17.366 A:middle
Let's say I'm running my first

00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:19.416 A:middle
marathon and I'm really excited

00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:21.526 A:middle
about it and using my favorite

00:31:21.526 --> 00:31:23.106 A:middle
workout app to track this

00:31:23.106 --> 00:31:25.776 A:middle
marathon, but I only realize at

00:31:25.836 --> 00:31:28.336 A:middle
the end that the app actually

00:31:28.336 --> 00:31:30.126 A:middle
crashed sometime in the middle,

00:31:30.596 --> 00:31:32.876 A:middle
making me lose all of this data.

00:31:33.146 --> 00:31:35.496 A:middle
Well, with watchOS 5, we are

00:31:35.496 --> 00:31:37.426 A:middle
introducing workout recovery

00:31:38.086 --> 00:31:39.626 A:middle
that will solve that problem for

00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:40.463 A:middle
you.

If your application happens to

00:31:46.336 --> 00:31:48.496 A:middle
crash during an active workout,

00:31:49.286 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
we will automatically relaunch

00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:52.966 A:middle
it and give it a chance to

00:31:52.966 --> 00:31:53.986 A:middle
recover the workout.

00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:57.116 A:middle
The workout session as well as

00:31:57.116 --> 00:32:00.046 A:middle
the builder will be recovered in
