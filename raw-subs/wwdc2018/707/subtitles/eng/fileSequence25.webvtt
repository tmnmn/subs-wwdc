00:24:56.366 --> 00:25:00.156 A:middle
Next, let's set up the session

00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:00.706 A:middle
and builder.

00:25:01.526 --> 00:25:04.646 A:middle
So in this case, I want my

00:25:04.826 --> 00:25:06.336 A:middle
interface controller to be the

00:25:06.336 --> 00:25:08.846 A:middle
delegate of both the session and

00:25:08.846 --> 00:25:09.346 A:middle
the builder.

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:11.326 A:middle
And because I also want to

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:13.286 A:middle
collect samples generated by the

00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:15.666 A:middle
device, I'm going to use here a

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:18.366 A:middle
live data source and pass it a

00:25:18.366 --> 00:25:20.676 A:middle
workout configuration so that

00:25:20.676 --> 00:25:22.576 A:middle
the types are automatically

00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:24.166 A:middle
inferred for me.

00:25:25.636 --> 00:25:28.986 A:middle
Finally, I simply start the

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:31.166 A:middle
session as well as the builder.

00:25:31.436 --> 00:25:35.256 A:middle
So now that my workout is

00:25:35.256 --> 00:25:37.206 A:middle
started, the first thing that I

00:25:37.206 --> 00:25:39.526 A:middle
need to do is to start my

00:25:39.526 --> 00:25:40.996 A:middle
elapsedTime timer.

00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:43.026 A:middle
And so I'm going to do that here

00:25:43.506 --> 00:25:45.226 A:middle
in the callback of the

00:25:45.226 --> 00:25:46.286 A:middle
beingCollectionCall.

00:25:46.906 --> 00:25:51.356 A:middle
I have a method here that will

00:25:51.586 --> 00:25:52.196 A:middle
do that for me.

00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:55.716 A:middle
And of course, because pause and

00:25:55.716 --> 00:25:57.726 A:middle
resume events can also affect

00:25:58.586 --> 00:26:00.626 A:middle
the duration, I'm going to have
