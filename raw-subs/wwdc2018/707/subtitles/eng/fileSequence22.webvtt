00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.026 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:22:01.436 --> 00:22:03.136 A:middle
And of course, we need to make

00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:04.806 A:middle
sure that we always ask for

00:22:04.806 --> 00:22:06.476 A:middle
authorization when we need it.

00:22:07.216 --> 00:22:09.516 A:middle
In my case here, I want to do

00:22:09.516 --> 00:22:11.586 A:middle
that every time the user is

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:14.196 A:middle
presented with this UI so that I

00:22:14.196 --> 00:22:15.416 A:middle
can make sure that I have the

00:22:15.416 --> 00:22:17.346 A:middle
authorization before starting a

00:22:17.346 --> 00:22:17.736 A:middle
workout.

00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:20.896 A:middle
So this view here is backed by

00:22:20.896 --> 00:22:24.006 A:middle
my workoutStartView Watchkit

00:22:24.006 --> 00:22:25.746 A:middle
interface controller, and I'm

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.506 A:middle
going to go ahead and implement

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:29.726 A:middle
the authorization in the

00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:31.506 A:middle
didAppear method.

00:22:33.636 --> 00:22:36.156 A:middle
So first, my typesToShare here

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:37.746 A:middle
is workout because I want to be

00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:39.616 A:middle
able to save a workout at the

00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:39.846 A:middle
end.

00:22:42.376 --> 00:22:44.296 A:middle
Next, I would like to read

00:22:44.486 --> 00:22:47.206 A:middle
heartRate, activeEnergyBurned,

00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:48.726 A:middle
as well as

00:22:48.906 --> 00:22:50.106 A:middle
distanceWalkingRunning.

00:22:50.626 --> 00:22:53.256 A:middle
Once I have my typesToShare and

00:22:53.256 --> 00:22:55.836 A:middle
typesToRead, I just need to call

00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:57.966 A:middle
requestAuthorization on the

00:22:57.966 --> 00:23:01.796 A:middle
healthStore and pass the types.
