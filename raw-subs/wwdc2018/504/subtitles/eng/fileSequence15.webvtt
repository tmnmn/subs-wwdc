00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:01.106 A:middle
call the activate function and

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:02.926 A:middle
then when the completion comes

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:04.676 A:middle
back, what we call the route

00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:06.176 A:middle
picker is going to get displayed

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:06.956 A:middle
on your behalf.

00:15:07.336 --> 00:15:09.636 A:middle
And so this is what the route

00:15:09.636 --> 00:15:10.516 A:middle
picker looks like.

00:15:10.516 --> 00:15:11.396 A:middle
And so this is going to be

00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:12.616 A:middle
showing up within your

00:15:12.616 --> 00:15:14.126 A:middle
application, which is going to

00:15:14.126 --> 00:15:15.966 A:middle
allow your user to pick

00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:17.266 A:middle
whichever Bluetooth headphones

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:18.746 A:middle
route they want to have and

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:19.656 A:middle
control their playback.

00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:22.636 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit more

00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:23.486 A:middle
about that route picker.

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.446 A:middle
Again, all it is, you just call

00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:26.796 A:middle
your asynchronous activate

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:29.496 A:middle
function, which is going to call

00:15:29.496 --> 00:15:32.036 A:middle
and show your route picker, and

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:33.456 A:middle
then it's going to come back

00:15:33.796 --> 00:15:34.856 A:middle
into your completion, and you

00:15:34.856 --> 00:15:36.196 A:middle
handle that, and you just call

00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:36.396 A:middle
play.

00:15:36.396 --> 00:15:38.026 A:middle
And you're going to want to do

00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:39.146 A:middle
this every time you want

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:40.016 A:middle
playback to occur.

00:15:40.236 --> 00:15:41.566 A:middle
So that way, you can ensure that

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.846 A:middle
you have appropriate route to

00:15:43.846 --> 00:15:45.046 A:middle
cause some playback to occur.

00:15:46.496 --> 00:15:47.956 A:middle
All right, so let's jump into

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:49.246 A:middle
code and set up our session.

00:15:49.886 --> 00:15:50.836 A:middle
And so we have our

00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:52.576 A:middle
AVAudioSession, and then we're

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:53.676 A:middle
going to set our category to

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:54.256 A:middle
playback.

00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:55.506 A:middle
And then, we're going to set our

00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:56.606 A:middle
mode to default.

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.706 A:middle
And then, most importantly,

00:15:58.706 --> 00:15:59.596 A:middle
we're going to set our route

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:01.176 A:middle
sharing policy to longform.
