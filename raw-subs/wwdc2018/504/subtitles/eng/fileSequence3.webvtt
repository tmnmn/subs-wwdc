00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.426 A:middle
I get my power song, "Eye of the

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:02.096 A:middle
Tiger," and I'm a little bit of

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:03.376 A:middle
a dork, so I actually do listen

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:05.016 A:middle
to this song sometimes when I

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:05.486 A:middle
work out.

00:03:05.486 --> 00:03:05.956 A:middle
I love it.

00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:07.596 A:middle
And this is a great experience.

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:08.896 A:middle
You just swipe over, and you can

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:11.076 A:middle
allow your user to control the

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:11.546 A:middle
playback.

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:13.246 A:middle
And so if you're building a

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:15.066 A:middle
workout app, and you can do

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:16.736 A:middle
this, build the same sort of

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:18.006 A:middle
experience, just embedding the

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.856 A:middle
Now Playing view directly within

00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:20.656 A:middle
your application.

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:22.826 A:middle
Let's talk about the

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.306 A:middle
characteristics of that Now

00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:24.846 A:middle
Playing view.

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:26.796 A:middle
And the first thing I want to

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:28.346 A:middle
note is that the Digital Crown

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.426 A:middle
controls the volume.

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:31.396 A:middle
And because of that, you're

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:32.536 A:middle
going to want to place this view

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.026 A:middle
in a non-scrolling controller.

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.326 A:middle
So for instance, it's, in my app

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:38.686 A:middle
here, I've actually just pushed

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.126 A:middle
directly to a controller that

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:41.886 A:middle
has the Now Playing view in it.

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:43.746 A:middle
Or you could reload directly to

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:45.726 A:middle
a page that has this controller

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.486 A:middle
or place it in a page interface

00:03:47.806 --> 00:03:48.966 A:middle
similar to the workout app.

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:52.366 A:middle
And this view is going to

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.006 A:middle
automatically switch the sources

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:54.646 A:middle
on behalf.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:56.606 A:middle
So no matter if it's the iPhone

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.256 A:middle
or the watch that's providing

00:03:58.256 --> 00:03:59.766 A:middle
the source of audio playback,
