00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:01.446 A:middle
And when we're actually playing

00:27:01.446 --> 00:27:03.996 A:middle
back some audio, our app will be

00:27:03.996 --> 00:27:06.046 A:middle
kept frontmost for the duration

00:27:06.046 --> 00:27:07.796 A:middle
of that session, just like when

00:27:07.796 --> 00:27:08.586 A:middle
we were actually remote

00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:10.006 A:middle
controlling the audio when it

00:27:10.006 --> 00:27:11.266 A:middle
was occurring on iPhone.

00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:13.566 A:middle
And again, if the user ever

00:27:13.566 --> 00:27:15.716 A:middle
navigates away, then you're no

00:27:15.716 --> 00:27:17.646 A:middle
longer frontmost, but your

00:27:17.646 --> 00:27:19.066 A:middle
background playback will still

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:20.016 A:middle
occur appropriately.

00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:22.346 A:middle
And in that case, you can, of

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:23.826 A:middle
course, properly handle all of

00:27:23.826 --> 00:27:26.266 A:middle
your background events.

00:27:26.266 --> 00:27:26.766 A:middle
All right.

00:27:28.656 --> 00:27:30.786 A:middle
So now, we're -- and when we are

00:27:30.786 --> 00:27:33.746 A:middle
in that frontmost state, then we

00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:35.306 A:middle
also can integrate properly with

00:27:35.306 --> 00:27:36.116 A:middle
notification.

00:27:36.116 --> 00:27:38.406 A:middle
So we could post, for example,

00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:39.586 A:middle
when the download completes, a

00:27:39.586 --> 00:27:40.806 A:middle
content available local

00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:41.546 A:middle
notification.

00:27:42.006 --> 00:27:43.466 A:middle
And we might want to have play

00:27:43.466 --> 00:27:44.826 A:middle
as our primary action.

00:27:45.596 --> 00:27:46.876 A:middle
And with our new interaction

00:27:46.876 --> 00:27:49.046 A:middle
notifications on watchOS, we can

00:27:49.046 --> 00:27:50.396 A:middle
allow our user to actually

00:27:50.396 --> 00:27:52.906 A:middle
configure some playback right

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:54.766 A:middle
from within the notification and

00:27:54.766 --> 00:27:56.156 A:middle
then be able to call play as the

00:27:56.156 --> 00:27:57.946 A:middle
primary action, then get into

00:27:57.946 --> 00:27:59.616 A:middle
your app and immediately cause

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:00.646 A:middle
some playback to occur.
