00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
Here we are in code, and I see

00:09:00.546 --> 00:09:02.236 A:middle
my WCSession FileTransfer.

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:03.996 A:middle
And new, there's a progress

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:05.526 A:middle
property that's available in

00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:08.166 A:middle
watchOS 5 and iOS 12.

00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:14.666 A:middle
And then, I can just get my

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:16.186 A:middle
fileTransfer, query for the

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:18.746 A:middle
progress, and update my view on

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:18.966 A:middle
iOS.

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:21.476 A:middle
And if you want to know some

00:09:21.476 --> 00:09:22.766 A:middle
more about watch connectivity.

00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:24.346 A:middle
There's some great sample code

00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.596 A:middle
that's available online.

00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:27.056 A:middle
Highly recommend you check it

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:28.196 A:middle
out, the simple watch

00:09:28.196 --> 00:09:29.426 A:middle
connectivity sample code.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:33.196 A:middle
And you might be wondering --

00:09:33.776 --> 00:09:34.936 A:middle
there's URLSession, there's

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:36.896 A:middle
watch connectivity -- which one

00:09:37.106 --> 00:09:38.176 A:middle
do we use, exactly?

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.486 A:middle
And when does it make sense?

00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:43.126 A:middle
Well, for URLSession, we want to

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:44.176 A:middle
use that when it's user

00:09:44.176 --> 00:09:45.866 A:middle
initiated on the watch itself.

00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:47.566 A:middle
And then, when we do that, we

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:48.836 A:middle
want a query the waits for

00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:50.676 A:middle
connectivity property to know

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:51.586 A:middle
that we have a network

00:09:51.586 --> 00:09:54.136 A:middle
connection at that point.

00:09:54.306 --> 00:09:55.476 A:middle
And I just wanted to mention

00:09:55.476 --> 00:09:57.006 A:middle
that if the iPhone is nearby,

00:09:57.006 --> 00:09:58.306 A:middle
then requests are proxied

00:09:58.606 --> 00:09:59.876 A:middle
through the iPhone when it's in

00:09:59.876 --> 00:10:00.336 A:middle
range.
