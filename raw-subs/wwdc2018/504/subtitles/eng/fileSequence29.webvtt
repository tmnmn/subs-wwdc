00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:00.846 A:middle
still post that notification.

00:29:01.226 --> 00:29:02.436 A:middle
Or maybe because my app's

00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:04.176 A:middle
frontmost, I could just play a

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.076 A:middle
haptic and let my user know

00:29:06.076 --> 00:29:07.586 A:middle
that, hey, raise your wrist, and

00:29:07.586 --> 00:29:08.516 A:middle
there's some new content.

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:09.556 A:middle
I can update my view.

00:29:10.216 --> 00:29:11.436 A:middle
And again, if you want to know

00:29:11.436 --> 00:29:12.686 A:middle
some more about the frontmost

00:29:12.686 --> 00:29:14.396 A:middle
notifications, check out the

00:29:14.396 --> 00:29:15.636 A:middle
Life of a watchOS App.

00:29:16.516 --> 00:29:18.396 A:middle
Great, so that's how we used our

00:29:18.396 --> 00:29:19.976 A:middle
interactive notifications and

00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:22.266 A:middle
the frontmost app state, but we

00:29:22.266 --> 00:29:24.026 A:middle
also want to show up on the Siri

00:29:24.026 --> 00:29:24.756 A:middle
watch face.

00:29:25.756 --> 00:29:27.306 A:middle
And with audio apps, you can

00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:28.906 A:middle
provide suggestions of audio to

00:29:28.906 --> 00:29:30.806 A:middle
play on the Siri watch face

00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:32.336 A:middle
using relevant shortcuts.

00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:34.546 A:middle
So for example, that could be

00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:36.356 A:middle
the next episode of your user's

00:29:36.356 --> 00:29:38.506 A:middle
favorite podcast or the new

00:29:38.506 --> 00:29:39.896 A:middle
music that you just synced over

00:29:39.896 --> 00:29:40.506 A:middle
to the watch.

00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:46.116 A:middle
For example, Audible was able to

00:29:46.116 --> 00:29:47.586 A:middle
build the same experience where

00:29:47.976 --> 00:29:49.726 A:middle
they can just get their user

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:50.616 A:middle
directly within their

00:29:50.616 --> 00:29:52.156 A:middle
application from the Siri watch

00:29:52.156 --> 00:29:54.126 A:middle
face and resume the playback of

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:54.756 A:middle
an audiobook.

00:29:55.236 --> 00:29:59.036 A:middle
And whenever a user interaction

00:29:59.036 --> 00:30:00.866 A:middle
is occurring, just wanted to
