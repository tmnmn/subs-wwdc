00:23:00.056 --> 00:23:01.406 A:middle
So as long as the user is

00:23:01.406 --> 00:23:02.726 A:middle
listening to content on iPhone,

00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:04.736 A:middle
then our app will stay

00:23:04.736 --> 00:23:06.076 A:middle
frontmost, unless the user

00:23:06.076 --> 00:23:07.296 A:middle
decides to navigate away.

00:23:08.556 --> 00:23:11.196 A:middle
And new in watchOS 5 is we're

00:23:11.196 --> 00:23:12.756 A:middle
exposing a Now Playing session

00:23:12.756 --> 00:23:14.816 A:middle
API where you're going to know

00:23:14.816 --> 00:23:16.236 A:middle
when you're launched for this

00:23:16.236 --> 00:23:17.756 A:middle
Now Playing session on iPhone,

00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:19.496 A:middle
and so you can take your user

00:23:19.496 --> 00:23:21.106 A:middle
directly to the appropriate

00:23:21.106 --> 00:23:21.396 A:middle
view.

00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:24.026 A:middle
And to do this, you're going to

00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:25.486 A:middle
use the handleRemoteNow

00:23:25.486 --> 00:23:27.216 A:middle
PlayingActivity on your

00:23:27.216 --> 00:23:28.326 A:middle
WKExtension Delegate.

00:23:30.026 --> 00:23:31.636 A:middle
So let's take a look at some

00:23:31.636 --> 00:23:33.086 A:middle
code and see how we could use

00:23:35.796 --> 00:23:35.896 A:middle
this.

00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:36.976 A:middle
So here we are.

00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:38.196 A:middle
I have my extension delegate,

00:23:39.176 --> 00:23:40.406 A:middle
and then I can implement my

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:42.316 A:middle
handleRemoteNow PlayingActivity.

00:23:43.216 --> 00:23:44.286 A:middle
And the first thing I want to

00:23:44.286 --> 00:23:46.216 A:middle
check is, where is my user at

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:46.846 A:middle
that time?

00:23:47.476 --> 00:23:50.256 A:middle
So I can just grab the visible

00:23:50.256 --> 00:23:51.926 A:middle
interface controller, I can

00:23:51.926 --> 00:23:54.016 A:middle
check where my user is, and if

00:23:54.016 --> 00:23:55.856 A:middle
the user already is at my Now

00:23:55.856 --> 00:23:57.576 A:middle
Playing UI, that's great.

00:23:57.776 --> 00:23:58.746 A:middle
Let's leave them right there.

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.116 A:middle
But in the case they're not, we
