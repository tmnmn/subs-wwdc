00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:00.726 A:middle
background modes.

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:04.366 A:middle
And then, you just appropriately

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:05.656 A:middle
set up your session, and you're

00:14:05.656 --> 00:14:06.806 A:middle
going to want to tell the system

00:14:06.806 --> 00:14:07.696 A:middle
that you want to play this

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:09.136 A:middle
long-form content in the

00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:09.646 A:middle
background.

00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:13.456 A:middle
You want to allow your user to

00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:14.736 A:middle
select a different route.

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:16.976 A:middle
And then, you're just going to

00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:18.416 A:middle
want to call play and

00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:19.656 A:middle
appropriately handle the

00:14:19.656 --> 00:14:20.916 A:middle
playback when the user's in the

00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:23.006 A:middle
middle of that playback session.

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:25.606 A:middle
So let's break that more, break

00:14:25.606 --> 00:14:28.266 A:middle
that down more a little bit.

00:14:29.196 --> 00:14:30.956 A:middle
And so in Xcode in the Project

00:14:30.956 --> 00:14:32.486 A:middle
Settings, in the Capabilities

00:14:32.486 --> 00:14:34.696 A:middle
tab, you just flip the switch

00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:35.876 A:middle
for Background Mode, you check

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.396 A:middle
off Audio, and you're good to go

00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:38.206 A:middle
to the next step.

00:14:38.576 --> 00:14:42.056 A:middle
And so to set up your session,

00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:43.186 A:middle
you're going to want to set your

00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.126 A:middle
routeSharingPolicy to longform

00:14:45.346 --> 00:14:46.626 A:middle
on your AVAudioSession.

00:14:46.726 --> 00:14:49.026 A:middle
And then, you call the new

00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:50.886 A:middle
activate withOptions completion

00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:53.726 A:middle
method on AVAudioSession.

00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:55.276 A:middle
And then, once it completes,

00:14:55.276 --> 00:14:56.216 A:middle
you're going to call play.

00:14:57.276 --> 00:14:58.946 A:middle
And in between when you first

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:01.106 A:middle
call the activate function and
