00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:00.646 A:middle
some playback to occur.

00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:03.546 A:middle
So for example, say I had a

00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:06.146 A:middle
Salvador Dali exhibit.

00:28:06.146 --> 00:28:07.226 A:middle
It's ready to go.

00:28:07.296 --> 00:28:08.556 A:middle
I can then adjust the playback

00:28:08.556 --> 00:28:10.496 A:middle
speed, immediately call play,

00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:12.976 A:middle
that'll launch my app, and then

00:28:12.976 --> 00:28:14.556 A:middle
I can play that great content at

00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:16.006 A:middle
the appropriate rate for my

00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:16.326 A:middle
user.

00:28:16.326 --> 00:28:19.796 A:middle
If you want to know more about

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:21.336 A:middle
some interactive notifications,

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:22.856 A:middle
check out the What's New in

00:28:22.856 --> 00:28:24.226 A:middle
watchOS talk given earlier,

00:28:24.876 --> 00:28:26.056 A:middle
which is available online.

00:28:26.056 --> 00:28:27.676 A:middle
It was a great talk, and you'll

00:28:27.676 --> 00:28:28.756 A:middle
know a lot more about

00:28:28.756 --> 00:28:30.176 A:middle
interactive notifications after

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:31.206 A:middle
watching it.

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:33.526 A:middle
All right, so do you remember

00:28:33.526 --> 00:28:35.486 A:middle
this code from before where I

00:28:35.486 --> 00:28:36.456 A:middle
actually posted that

00:28:36.456 --> 00:28:39.316 A:middle
notification alerting our user

00:28:39.316 --> 00:28:40.376 A:middle
of this type of playback

00:28:40.376 --> 00:28:40.966 A:middle
opportunity?

00:28:41.396 --> 00:28:42.716 A:middle
Well, let's say our app was

00:28:42.716 --> 00:28:45.046 A:middle
frontmost at that time.

00:28:45.246 --> 00:28:46.336 A:middle
In that case, when I got

00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:48.006 A:middle
delivered the notification from

00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:50.306 A:middle
frontmost in user notification,

00:28:50.366 --> 00:28:52.126 A:middle
I'm going to get called into and

00:28:52.126 --> 00:28:53.866 A:middle
will present notification with

00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:55.276 A:middle
completion handler.

00:28:56.426 --> 00:28:57.886 A:middle
And in that case, I can actually

00:28:57.886 --> 00:28:59.406 A:middle
decide whether or not I want to

00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:00.846 A:middle
still post that notification.
