00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:00.596 A:middle
remote command center.

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.406 A:middle
If you want to know more about

00:21:03.406 --> 00:21:04.616 A:middle
the media player framework and

00:21:04.616 --> 00:21:05.696 A:middle
especially these media remote

00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:07.296 A:middle
commands, I highly recommend

00:21:07.296 --> 00:21:09.236 A:middle
checking out the MP remote

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:10.866 A:middle
command sample that's available

00:21:10.866 --> 00:21:11.376 A:middle
online.

00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:12.996 A:middle
And in this case, when I

00:21:12.996 --> 00:21:14.536 A:middle
actually set my preferred

00:21:14.536 --> 00:21:17.156 A:middle
intervals, then the system's Now

00:21:17.156 --> 00:21:18.606 A:middle
Playing app will appropriately

00:21:18.606 --> 00:21:19.226 A:middle
get adjusted.

00:21:19.226 --> 00:21:21.056 A:middle
That Now Playing UI, wherever it

00:21:21.056 --> 00:21:22.876 A:middle
is, will show the minus 15

00:21:22.876 --> 00:21:25.196 A:middle
seconds or plus 15 seconds, and

00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:29.396 A:middle
that's all done on your behalf.

00:21:29.546 --> 00:21:32.086 A:middle
All right, so that's the audio

00:21:32.086 --> 00:21:34.486 A:middle
experience on watch, or that's

00:21:34.486 --> 00:21:35.826 A:middle
our playback, so let's talk

00:21:35.826 --> 00:21:37.016 A:middle
about our audio experience.

00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:44.286 A:middle
So there's 4 major things I want

00:21:44.286 --> 00:21:45.316 A:middle
to talk about first for the

00:21:45.316 --> 00:21:46.086 A:middle
audio experience.

00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:47.506 A:middle
There's our auto-launching

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:48.536 A:middle
feature where your app will

00:21:48.536 --> 00:21:49.686 A:middle
automatically get launched.

00:21:50.236 --> 00:21:51.696 A:middle
There's the frontmost app state

00:21:51.696 --> 00:21:52.966 A:middle
and how we can take advantage of

00:21:52.966 --> 00:21:54.366 A:middle
that in our application.

00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:56.396 A:middle
There's our new interactive

00:21:56.396 --> 00:21:57.356 A:middle
notifications.

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.506 A:middle
And how to integrate with Siri

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:00.066 A:middle
Shortcuts.
