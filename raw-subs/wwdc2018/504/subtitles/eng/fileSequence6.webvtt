00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:01.166 A:middle
I want to allow my user to just

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.336 A:middle
tap in, listen to a guided tour

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.836 A:middle
while they're in the museum, and

00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:06.116 A:middle
it's a great experience on the

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.606 A:middle
watch because I can just put my

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:09.496 A:middle
phone away.

00:06:09.496 --> 00:06:10.716 A:middle
I can just have the entire

00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:12.666 A:middle
experience on my wrist and enjoy

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:14.656 A:middle
the beautiful art around me.

00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:17.936 A:middle
And let's say I had a, like a

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:19.706 A:middle
buffer that allowed my user to

00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:21.646 A:middle
download the content on, when

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:22.816 A:middle
they're on their way to the

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:23.446 A:middle
museum.

00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:25.616 A:middle
In that case, I would want to

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:27.926 A:middle
use URLSession and grab that

00:06:27.926 --> 00:06:29.726 A:middle
directly from my server, all my

00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:31.196 A:middle
content, and download it to the

00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:31.906 A:middle
watch itself.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.546 A:middle
So let's jump into some code and

00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:38.026 A:middle
see how we could do that.

00:06:38.226 --> 00:06:39.256 A:middle
So here we are.

00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:41.626 A:middle
I have an IBAction which is tied

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:43.206 A:middle
to my WK Interface button.

00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:44.246 A:middle
And the first thing you'll

00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:46.776 A:middle
notice is I set my frontmost

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:48.456 A:middle
timeout extended property to be

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:48.776 A:middle
true.

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:51.096 A:middle
And we're going to talk a little

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:52.546 A:middle
bit more about frontmost later,

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:53.586 A:middle
but the thing I wanted to

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:55.416 A:middle
mention is that the user has

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
made a user interaction, so it's

00:06:57.616 --> 00:06:59.496 A:middle
fair to say that the user, next

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:00.526 A:middle
time they raise their wrist,
