00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.216 A:middle
when the Apple Watch is on its

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:03.156 A:middle
charger, so keep that in mind.

00:11:03.326 --> 00:11:04.796 A:middle
All right, so we talked about

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:07.186 A:middle
getting content, and now that we

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:08.216 A:middle
have it, let's talk about

00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:09.466 A:middle
actually playing something back.

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:12.326 A:middle
And on watchOS, we have a bunch

00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:13.736 A:middle
of different tools we can use.

00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:16.226 A:middle
And some of those audio tools

00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:17.546 A:middle
are in WatchKit itself.

00:11:18.036 --> 00:11:20.646 A:middle
So there's a presentMedia

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.216 A:middle
PlayerController with options,

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:23.966 A:middle
completion that you can use.

00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:26.446 A:middle
And there's also WKAudioFile

00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:27.086 A:middle
QueuePlayer.

00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:29.076 A:middle
And so you can give it a list of

00:11:29.076 --> 00:11:30.416 A:middle
items, and then the queue player

00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:31.506 A:middle
will appropriately play back

00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:32.126 A:middle
that content.

00:11:32.636 --> 00:11:35.536 A:middle
So the presentMedia

00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:37.256 A:middle
PlayerController option will

00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:38.716 A:middle
present the system UI.

00:11:38.716 --> 00:11:40.006 A:middle
So the controls are taken care

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:40.656 A:middle
of for you.

00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:42.006 A:middle
There's not really much you have

00:11:42.006 --> 00:11:42.476 A:middle
to do.

00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:44.456 A:middle
And this is perfect for when

00:11:44.456 --> 00:11:46.306 A:middle
it's short-form content and you

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:47.176 A:middle
don't really want to have to

00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:48.686 A:middle
think too much about it.

00:11:50.096 --> 00:11:52.536 A:middle
And WKAudioFIleQueuePlayer is

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:53.416 A:middle
great for when you have more

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:54.736 A:middle
long-form content that you want

00:11:54.736 --> 00:11:55.706 A:middle
to play in the background.

00:11:56.126 --> 00:11:57.346 A:middle
And this is more of a conveyer

00:11:57.346 --> 00:12:00.116 A:middle
belt type approach where you
