00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:00.196 A:middle
So here I have my app.

00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:01.276 A:middle
It's foreground running.

00:25:01.276 --> 00:25:02.196 A:middle
I'm looking at it.

00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:04.066 A:middle
The screen is on, and this app

00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:05.486 A:middle
is considered active and

00:25:05.486 --> 00:25:06.176 A:middle
frontmost.

00:25:06.826 --> 00:25:07.766 A:middle
But then, let's say I put my

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:08.376 A:middle
wrist down.

00:25:09.546 --> 00:25:11.246 A:middle
In that case, the application is

00:25:11.246 --> 00:25:12.646 A:middle
still considered frontmost

00:25:13.106 --> 00:25:14.396 A:middle
because if I raise my wrist

00:25:14.396 --> 00:25:15.326 A:middle
again, I'll see that

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:15.996 A:middle
application.

00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:18.356 A:middle
And in that case, the

00:25:18.356 --> 00:25:19.916 A:middle
application is just in the

00:25:19.916 --> 00:25:20.506 A:middle
background.

00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:26.066 A:middle
So with the frontmost app state,

00:25:26.266 --> 00:25:27.226 A:middle
we get some enhanced

00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:28.586 A:middle
capabilities from the system.

00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:32.286 A:middle
Our background transfers from

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:33.856 A:middle
iPhones -- so say we were

00:25:33.856 --> 00:25:35.436 A:middle
transferring our content from

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:36.986 A:middle
iPhone to watch itself, those

00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:39.036 A:middle
background transfers, when they

00:25:39.036 --> 00:25:40.326 A:middle
complete, the resumes will

00:25:40.476 --> 00:25:42.266 A:middle
directly just wake up our app if

00:25:42.266 --> 00:25:43.276 A:middle
we're in the frontmost app

00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:43.586 A:middle
state.

00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:45.996 A:middle
And the same thing in, with our

00:25:45.996 --> 00:25:47.286 A:middle
URL session resumes.

00:25:47.616 --> 00:25:49.886 A:middle
So if the URL session, our

00:25:49.886 --> 00:25:51.246 A:middle
background session before was

00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:53.166 A:middle
downloading and it completes,

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:54.396 A:middle
then our app will automatically

00:25:54.396 --> 00:25:55.926 A:middle
get waked up and deliver the

00:25:55.926 --> 00:25:56.346 A:middle
payload.

00:25:56.826 --> 00:26:00.566 A:middle
And if we're frontmost, we're
