00:18:59.386 --> 00:19:00.636 A:middle
in the cases of any third-party

00:19:00.636 --> 00:19:02.586 A:middle
apps that embed that Now Playing

00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:02.906 A:middle
view.

00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:04.796 A:middle
This will also show up there.

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:07.366 A:middle
And then, with the MediaPlayer.

00:19:07.366 --> 00:19:08.326 A:middle
framework, we just want to

00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:10.386 A:middle
handle the events, any type of

00:19:10.386 --> 00:19:11.626 A:middle
media remote commands -- for

00:19:11.626 --> 00:19:13.396 A:middle
example, a Next Track on

00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:14.526 A:middle
AirPods, for instance.

00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:16.846 A:middle
All right, let's jump into some

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.146 A:middle
code and see how we can provide

00:19:18.146 --> 00:19:19.346 A:middle
that Now Playing information.

00:19:23.216 --> 00:19:24.776 A:middle
So here we are.

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:26.376 A:middle
We have our MPNowPlaying

00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:26.986 A:middle
InfoCenter.

00:19:26.986 --> 00:19:28.176 A:middle
We just want to grab that.

00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:29.386 A:middle
And then, we set up our

00:19:29.386 --> 00:19:30.406 A:middle
nowPlayingInfo.

00:19:30.956 --> 00:19:35.046 A:middle
And then, we have, we want to

00:19:35.046 --> 00:19:36.526 A:middle
set our artwork, our MPMedia

00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:37.566 A:middle
ItemArtwork.

00:19:37.866 --> 00:19:39.126 A:middle
And it's not currently available

00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:40.366 A:middle
in seed 1, but it's coming in

00:19:40.366 --> 00:19:40.876 A:middle
seed 2.

00:19:41.456 --> 00:19:43.526 A:middle
And in this case, the artwork

00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:45.306 A:middle
that you provide will display on

00:19:45.306 --> 00:19:46.436 A:middle
the Siri watch face.

00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:50.006 A:middle
And then, we just set up, in

00:19:50.006 --> 00:19:51.606 A:middle
this case, our title, album,

00:19:51.606 --> 00:19:53.646 A:middle
artwork, and then we set it to

00:19:53.646 --> 00:19:55.436 A:middle
our nowPlaying InfoCenter.

00:19:56.206 --> 00:19:57.726 A:middle
And then, when we do something

00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:01.206 A:middle
such as this, then our data will
