00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:00.066 A:middle
Shortcuts.

00:22:03.076 --> 00:22:05.566 A:middle
And so we've been talking a lot

00:22:05.566 --> 00:22:06.856 A:middle
about playback occurring on the

00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:09.316 A:middle
watch itself, but I want to take

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:10.836 A:middle
a step back, and I just wanted

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:11.986 A:middle
to talk through that remote

00:22:11.986 --> 00:22:14.946 A:middle
control case.

00:22:15.136 --> 00:22:16.886 A:middle
So let's say I was playing some

00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:19.026 A:middle
Apple Music on my iPhone, and

00:22:19.026 --> 00:22:20.426 A:middle
automatically the Now Playing

00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.176 A:middle
app will get displayed on my

00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:22.726 A:middle
watch.

00:22:23.016 --> 00:22:24.486 A:middle
And I love this feature.

00:22:24.486 --> 00:22:25.986 A:middle
It feels like magic when I just

00:22:25.986 --> 00:22:27.396 A:middle
look at my wrist and I can

00:22:27.396 --> 00:22:28.896 A:middle
easily control my playback.

00:22:28.896 --> 00:22:31.876 A:middle
I, it's the coolest thing.

00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:34.456 A:middle
And in the case where it's our

00:22:34.456 --> 00:22:35.626 A:middle
application that's actually

00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:37.226 A:middle
causing the playback to occur on

00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:38.626 A:middle
iPhone, then our app

00:22:38.626 --> 00:22:40.406 A:middle
automatically gets launched on

00:22:40.406 --> 00:22:40.936 A:middle
the watch.

00:22:45.356 --> 00:22:46.766 A:middle
And we call this the auto-launch

00:22:46.766 --> 00:22:47.886 A:middle
audio apps feature.

00:22:48.386 --> 00:22:49.766 A:middle
And so whenever the Now Playing

00:22:49.766 --> 00:22:51.496 A:middle
session is occurring on iPhone,

00:22:51.806 --> 00:22:53.426 A:middle
then our Apple Watch app will be

00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:55.116 A:middle
brought frontmost at that time.

00:22:56.126 --> 00:22:57.316 A:middle
And we're going to stay

00:22:57.316 --> 00:22:59.126 A:middle
frontmost for the duration of

00:22:59.126 --> 00:22:59.766 A:middle
that session.
