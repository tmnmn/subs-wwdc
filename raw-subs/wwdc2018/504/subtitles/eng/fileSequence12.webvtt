00:11:57.346 --> 00:12:00.116 A:middle
belt type approach where you

00:12:00.116 --> 00:12:01.726 A:middle
have some items, you just want

00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:02.896 A:middle
to hand it over to the system,

00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:03.916 A:middle
and the system will play it on

00:12:03.916 --> 00:12:04.426 A:middle
your behalf.

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:06.936 A:middle
And that's exactly what

00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:08.736 A:middle
WKAudioFileQueuePlayer is for.

00:12:09.086 --> 00:12:12.006 A:middle
And there's also AVFoundation at

00:12:12.006 --> 00:12:12.696 A:middle
our disposal.

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:19.136 A:middle
So there's AVAudioPlayer and

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:19.866 A:middle
AVAudioEngine.

00:12:20.396 --> 00:12:22.966 A:middle
And prior to watchOS 5, it was

00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:24.396 A:middle
tied to the workout background

00:12:24.396 --> 00:12:26.486 A:middle
mode, or when your application

00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:28.196 A:middle
was foreground and screen on.

00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:31.736 A:middle
For example, Nike Run Club app

00:12:31.796 --> 00:12:33.086 A:middle
actually did this exact thing,

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.346 A:middle
where you're in the middle of a

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:36.346 A:middle
run, you want some mindfulness,

00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:39.026 A:middle
you can play some guided

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:40.586 A:middle
meditation with Headspace.

00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:44.546 A:middle
And prior to watchOS 5,

00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:46.406 A:middle
background playback was, with

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:47.756 A:middle
AVFoundation, was really only

00:12:47.756 --> 00:12:48.936 A:middle
possible for these types of

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:49.666 A:middle
workout apps.

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:52.666 A:middle
But new in watchOS 5, there's a

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:54.296 A:middle
brand-new audio playback

00:12:54.456 --> 00:12:55.746 A:middle
background mode, which I'm

00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:56.716 A:middle
really thrilled for.

00:12:57.846 --> 00:13:00.296 A:middle
So let's talk about what we have
