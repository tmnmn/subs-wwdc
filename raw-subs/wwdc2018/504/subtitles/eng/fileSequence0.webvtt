&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:29.726 A:middle
My name is Neil Desai, and I'm a

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:31.456 A:middle
watchOS Frameworks engineer, and

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:33.116 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here to

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.216 A:middle
talk about how to create some

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:36.116 A:middle
great audio apps for watchOS.

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:38.276 A:middle
And honestly, we've been waiting

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:39.336 A:middle
a little over a year to give

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.566 A:middle
this talk, so I'm really happy

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.626 A:middle
to be here, so let's just jump

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:43.616 A:middle
right in.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.596 A:middle
In watchOS 4, we unveiled a

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:48.906 A:middle
revamped music and radio app.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.016 A:middle
And in watchOS 5, we unveiled a

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.386 A:middle
brand-new podcast app.

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:53.906 A:middle
And we're finding that users

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.156 A:middle
absolutely love being able to

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.366 A:middle
play audio on the go or in the

00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.286 A:middle
middle of a workout.
