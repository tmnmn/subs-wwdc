Use the relevant shortcut API to

00:31:00.706 --> 00:31:02.236 A:middle
appear on the Siri watch face.

00:31:03.436 --> 00:31:04.746 A:middle
And think through your shortcut

00:31:04.746 --> 00:31:05.256 A:middle
phrases.

00:31:06.786 --> 00:31:07.906 A:middle
And there's been some great

00:31:07.906 --> 00:31:09.706 A:middle
talks this week about shortcuts,

00:31:09.706 --> 00:31:10.986 A:middle
and I definitely wanted to

00:31:10.986 --> 00:31:12.326 A:middle
highlight the Shortcuts on the

00:31:12.326 --> 00:31:13.396 A:middle
Siri Watch Face talk.

00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:14.506 A:middle
I saw that myself.

00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:16.126 A:middle
It was a great talk, and I

00:31:16.126 --> 00:31:16.706 A:middle
learned a lot.

00:31:19.276 --> 00:31:21.556 A:middle
And so in summary, for the first

00:31:21.556 --> 00:31:23.436 A:middle
time, you can embed your native

00:31:23.436 --> 00:31:24.976 A:middle
controls directly from within

00:31:24.976 --> 00:31:25.866 A:middle
your application.

00:31:26.346 --> 00:31:27.676 A:middle
You can allow background

00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:29.226 A:middle
playback to occur however you

00:31:29.226 --> 00:31:30.986 A:middle
want and handle media remote

00:31:30.986 --> 00:31:32.176 A:middle
commands however you want.

00:31:32.636 --> 00:31:35.686 A:middle
And there are better ways that

00:31:35.686 --> 00:31:37.326 A:middle
transfer audio assets to your

00:31:37.326 --> 00:31:39.066 A:middle
watch and convey that type of

00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.416 A:middle
progress to your users.

00:31:41.556 --> 00:31:42.786 A:middle
So if you want some more

00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:44.836 A:middle
information, feel free to go

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.006 A:middle
online or join us in the lab

00:31:47.006 --> 00:31:47.816 A:middle
this afternoon.

00:31:49.016 --> 00:31:50.676 A:middle
I'm really excited to see what

00:31:50.676 --> 00:31:52.216 A:middle
type of audio apps are built on

00:31:52.216 --> 00:31:54.816 A:middle
watchOS, and thanks, everyone.

00:31:55.166 --> 00:31:57.106 A:middle
Have a great WWDC.

00:31:57.256 --> 00:31:57.816 A:middle
Thanks.
