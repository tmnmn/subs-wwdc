00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.116 A:middle
But in the case they're not, we

00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:03.916 A:middle
can just reload directly to our

00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:04.316 A:middle
view.

00:24:04.316 --> 00:24:05.836 A:middle
So that way, we have that same

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:07.636 A:middle
magical experience where I raise

00:24:07.636 --> 00:24:09.536 A:middle
my wrists and I see the remote

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:10.976 A:middle
controls that I want to use.

00:24:16.116 --> 00:24:18.396 A:middle
And in some cases, you might

00:24:18.396 --> 00:24:20.316 A:middle
want to opt out of this feature

00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:21.416 A:middle
if it doesn't make sense for

00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:22.056 A:middle
your user.

00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:23.896 A:middle
So just do the right thing.

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.066 A:middle
Make that decision.

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:26.556 A:middle
And let's say our app has

00:24:26.556 --> 00:24:28.616 A:middle
nothing to do with our phone

00:24:28.616 --> 00:24:29.946 A:middle
app, and that's an appropriate

00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:31.196 A:middle
use of actually opting out of

00:24:31.196 --> 00:24:32.086 A:middle
this capability.

00:24:32.836 --> 00:24:34.756 A:middle
And so to do so, use the auto,

00:24:34.946 --> 00:24:36.716 A:middle
the opt out of auto-launch

00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:40.396 A:middle
feature on your WK extension's

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:41.306 A:middle
info.plist.

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:44.916 A:middle
And in the case you do opt out,

00:24:44.996 --> 00:24:46.366 A:middle
then the Now Playing app will

00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:47.146 A:middle
show instead.

00:24:52.046 --> 00:24:53.716 A:middle
And now, let's talk about that

00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:55.116 A:middle
frontmost app state, and let's

00:24:55.116 --> 00:24:56.636 A:middle
give a little bit of a refresher

00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:56.906 A:middle
of that.

00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:00.196 A:middle
So here I have my app.
