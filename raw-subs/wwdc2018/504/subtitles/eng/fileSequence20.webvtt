00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:01.206 A:middle
such as this, then our data will

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:02.946 A:middle
appear in the Now Playing app.

00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:04.276 A:middle
And this is the actual Now

00:20:04.276 --> 00:20:04.816 A:middle
Playing app.

00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:07.516 A:middle
And I provided some, a song that

00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:09.476 A:middle
I was currently listening to in

00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:10.296 A:middle
my application.

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:13.866 A:middle
And when we do this, then, also,

00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:15.196 A:middle
the Now Playing complication

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.306 A:middle
will also get updated.

00:20:16.576 --> 00:20:17.726 A:middle
So in this case, the bottom

00:20:17.726 --> 00:20:18.866 A:middle
shows the "Lights in the Sky"

00:20:18.866 --> 00:20:19.956 A:middle
song that I was listening to.

00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:22.786 A:middle
And then, for media remote

00:20:22.786 --> 00:20:24.246 A:middle
commands, again, just use the

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:24.836 A:middle
MediaPlayer.

00:20:24.836 --> 00:20:25.256 A:middle
framework.

00:20:25.256 --> 00:20:27.416 A:middle
And now, in watchOS, you can

00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:28.846 A:middle
handle those commands however

00:20:28.846 --> 00:20:29.466 A:middle
you wish.

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:32.876 A:middle
So let's look at some code.

00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:34.456 A:middle
So we just grab our

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:35.986 A:middle
MPRemoteCommandCenter.

00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:38.266 A:middle
And then, instead of doing a

00:20:38.266 --> 00:20:40.046 A:middle
Next Track, let's talk about how

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:42.156 A:middle
we can actually skip forward for

00:20:42.656 --> 00:20:43.546 A:middle
our user.

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:44.846 A:middle
So I have this function.

00:20:44.966 --> 00:20:46.966 A:middle
It's a enableSkipForwardCommand

00:20:47.396 --> 00:20:48.666 A:middle
and, just by default, takes in

00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:49.866 A:middle
15 seconds.

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.646 A:middle
And I set my preferred intervals

00:20:52.646 --> 00:20:53.836 A:middle
on my skip forward command.

00:20:53.946 --> 00:20:55.966 A:middle
And then, I just add a target

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:57.836 A:middle
and selector, and then I just

00:20:57.836 --> 00:20:59.636 A:middle
enable the command within my

00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:00.596 A:middle
remote command center.
