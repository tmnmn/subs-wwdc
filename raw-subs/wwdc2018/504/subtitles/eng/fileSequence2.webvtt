00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.416 A:middle
something back for our user?

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:02.766 A:middle
And lastly, we're going to go

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.296 A:middle
over the whole audio experience

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.656 A:middle
and how to build a really rich

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:07.296 A:middle
experience for our users that

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.536 A:middle
integrates well throughout the

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:09.356 A:middle
entire system.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.746 A:middle
So let's talk about our native

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:13.326 A:middle
controls.

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:17.736 A:middle
In watchOS 5, we're unveiling

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.046 A:middle
two new controls that you can

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.246 A:middle
embed directly within your

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:20.936 A:middle
application.

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:23.756 A:middle
And the first is a Now Playing

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:25.696 A:middle
view which you can embed within

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:26.746 A:middle
your watchOS app.

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:29.306 A:middle
And this is really great for

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:31.356 A:middle
content that may not be yours,

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:31.966 A:middle
for instance.

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:34.876 A:middle
And you can also embed a volume

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:36.286 A:middle
control so you can build your

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:38.166 A:middle
own custom UI to allow your user

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.016 A:middle
to control the volume.

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:42.306 A:middle
And you might be wondering for

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:43.326 A:middle
that first view, that Now

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:45.686 A:middle
Playing view, when exactly would

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.446 A:middle
I ever want to allow my user to

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:49.646 A:middle
control some audio, but the

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:50.986 A:middle
content's not exactly mine?

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:53.276 A:middle
Well, let me give you an

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:53.676 A:middle
example.

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:54.756 A:middle
We do this ourselves in the

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:55.406 A:middle
workout app.

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:56.936 A:middle
So I'm in the middle of a HIIT

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:57.606 A:middle
workout.

00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:58.636 A:middle
I swipe to the left.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.426 A:middle
I get my power song, "Eye of the
