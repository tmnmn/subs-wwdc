00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:01.356 A:middle
this view's going to take care

00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:01.966 A:middle
of it for you.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.096 A:middle
You don't have to worry about

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:03.846 A:middle
that.

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:06.466 A:middle
And lastly, the Now Playing

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:07.696 A:middle
view, it's going to grab your

00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:09.426 A:middle
application's tint color so it

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:10.956 A:middle
fits within the look and feel of

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:11.846 A:middle
your application.

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:15.616 A:middle
Now, to use this, let's see how

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:17.336 A:middle
it looks in Interface Builder.

00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:19.446 A:middle
Here we are in Xcode, and I've

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:20.916 A:middle
selected my Object Library, and

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:22.696 A:middle
then I can just drag and drop my

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.206 A:middle
Now Playing view into a

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:24.866 A:middle
controller.

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:26.496 A:middle
Once my user navigates to that

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:28.106 A:middle
view, everything will be done

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:28.496 A:middle
for you.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:29.646 A:middle
The system will take care of it

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:29.816 A:middle
all.

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.726 A:middle
And it really is just that

00:04:31.726 --> 00:04:32.096 A:middle
simple.

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:35.046 A:middle
So that's our Now Playing view.

00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:36.966 A:middle
Now, let's talk about our volume

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:37.386 A:middle
control.

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.606 A:middle
So the volume control can be set

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.616 A:middle
up to either control the

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:43.136 A:middle
iPhone's volume or the local

00:04:43.136 --> 00:04:43.936 A:middle
watch's volume.

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.216 A:middle
And just like our Now Playing

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:47.606 A:middle
view, we're going to grab your

00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:48.946 A:middle
application's tint color and

00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:51.026 A:middle
apply it appropriately to this

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:51.896 A:middle
particular control.

00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:56.656 A:middle
And in the case of when the user

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.426 A:middle
is actually scrolling with the

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.126 A:middle
Digital Crown, then, in that
