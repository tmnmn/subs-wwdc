00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:02.686 A:middle
And we're also finding that

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:04.275 A:middle
users really like to be able to

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:05.696 A:middle
remote control some playback

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:06.776 A:middle
that's occurring on another

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:07.316 A:middle
device.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.326 A:middle
For example, your iPhone or

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:09.956 A:middle
HomePod.

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:11.486 A:middle
And I especially really like

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:12.016 A:middle
this feature.

00:01:12.016 --> 00:01:13.636 A:middle
I love just being able to play

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.916 A:middle
some music out of my iPhone and

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.196 A:middle
then being able to control the

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:18.716 A:middle
volume, for instance, directly

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:19.456 A:middle
with my watch.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:20.996 A:middle
That's a great feature.

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:23.426 A:middle
And today, with watchOS 5, we're

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:25.086 A:middle
going to show you how to build a

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:27.016 A:middle
great experience like you saw on

00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:28.396 A:middle
the keynote like Audible was

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:30.466 A:middle
able to make and just like

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:31.626 A:middle
Pandora was able to make.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.516 A:middle
And so they were able to use

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:36.756 A:middle
some of the new tools available

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:37.726 A:middle
in watchOS 5.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.526 A:middle
And today, we're going to talk

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:40.836 A:middle
about how we can do the same

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:41.436 A:middle
sort of thing.

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:43.156 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:44.686 A:middle
talk about four major themes.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.736 A:middle
We're going to talk about our

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:48.276 A:middle
native controls and how we can

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:49.926 A:middle
now embed our system controls

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.926 A:middle
directly within our application.

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:53.856 A:middle
We're going to talk about, how

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:55.296 A:middle
do we get content over to the

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:55.846 A:middle
watch?

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:57.496 A:middle
And then, once we have that

00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:59.186 A:middle
content, how do we actually play

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.416 A:middle
something back for our user?
