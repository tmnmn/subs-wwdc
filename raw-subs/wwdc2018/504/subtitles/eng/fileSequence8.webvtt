00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:00.796 A:middle
calls me and gives me that

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:01.436 A:middle
information.

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:04.086 A:middle
And when I do this, I can just

00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:06.646 A:middle
update progress for my user in

00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:07.026 A:middle
my UI.

00:08:07.726 --> 00:08:10.266 A:middle
And then, when the download

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:12.316 A:middle
completes, I can, of course,

00:08:12.316 --> 00:08:13.686 A:middle
manage the file, and I might

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:15.426 A:middle
want to post a notification

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:17.156 A:middle
alerting my user that there's a

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:18.246 A:middle
playback opportunity.

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:21.976 A:middle
And, of course, I'm also going

00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:22.936 A:middle
to be called into a

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.946 A:middle
didCompleteWithError, so I just

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:26.266 A:middle
want to clean up appropriately

00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:28.066 A:middle
and handle any errors at that

00:08:28.066 --> 00:08:28.916 A:middle
point, if there are any.

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:31.466 A:middle
And that's wonderful,

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:32.976 A:middle
URLSession, for when we can

00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:34.265 A:middle
download directly to the watch,

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.416 A:middle
but sometimes the content might

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:38.056 A:middle
already exist on our iPhone.

00:08:39.106 --> 00:08:40.576 A:middle
In that case, we can just use

00:08:40.576 --> 00:08:42.135 A:middle
watch connectivity and transfer

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:43.946 A:middle
the file directly over to our

00:08:43.946 --> 00:08:44.416 A:middle
watch.

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:50.336 A:middle
And to do so, we'll just use the

00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:51.426 A:middle
transfer file API.

00:08:51.426 --> 00:08:53.946 A:middle
And new in watchOS 5, you can

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.756 A:middle
get the progress of that

00:08:55.756 --> 00:08:56.256 A:middle
transfer.

00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:58.306 A:middle
So let's take a look.

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
Here we are in code, and I see
