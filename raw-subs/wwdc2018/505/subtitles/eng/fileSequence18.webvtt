00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.096 A:middle
we add that.

00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:02.236 A:middle
Change observer.

00:18:02.236 --> 00:18:04.876 A:middle
And, down here--

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.146 A:middle
We implement

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:11.526 A:middle
photoLibraryDidChange.

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:14.456 A:middle
PhotoLibraryDidChange is called

00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:16.396 A:middle
whenever anything changes in the

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:19.946 A:middle
photo library, and we get a

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:22.016 A:middle
change instance as a method

00:18:22.016 --> 00:18:22.396 A:middle
argument.

00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:25.036 A:middle
We can ask the change engine

00:18:25.066 --> 00:18:27.286 A:middle
instance for changeDetails of an

00:18:27.286 --> 00:18:28.286 A:middle
object we're interested in.

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.386 A:middle
We're interested in the changes

00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:32.596 A:middle
of the fetchAllAssets on the

00:18:32.596 --> 00:18:34.106 A:middle
project, so we pass that

00:18:34.106 --> 00:18:34.866 A:middle
fetchResult in.

00:18:35.746 --> 00:18:38.186 A:middle
And, if change results are

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:41.256 A:middle
returned, we update our locally

00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:43.786 A:middle
cached fetch result with the

00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:45.846 A:middle
fetchResultsAfterChanges, and

00:18:45.846 --> 00:18:47.616 A:middle
get the projectExtensionContext,

00:18:47.616 --> 00:18:49.436 A:middle
and call updatedProjectInfo.

00:18:50.636 --> 00:18:52.256 A:middle
And pass in the project info we

00:18:53.136 --> 00:18:53.226 A:middle
have.

00:18:53.656 --> 00:18:55.876 A:middle
Once the updatedProjectInfo is

00:18:55.876 --> 00:18:57.576 A:middle
returned to us, we call the same

00:18:57.576 --> 00:18:59.176 A:middle
setup code, but you could do

00:18:59.176 --> 00:19:00.626 A:middle
something more sophisticated in
