00:29:02.076 --> 00:29:02.626 A:middle
Good morning.

00:29:03.556 --> 00:29:05.256 A:middle
We're going to look at a simple

00:29:05.256 --> 00:29:07.136 A:middle
beam generator app, which has a

00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.506 A:middle
few issues with drag and drop.

00:29:08.506 --> 00:29:09.976 A:middle
And we're going to dive into

00:29:09.976 --> 00:29:11.676 A:middle
Xcode, and try to fix those

00:29:11.676 --> 00:29:11.976 A:middle
issues together.

00:29:20.046 --> 00:29:21.246 A:middle
So, here is my simple app.

00:29:21.576 --> 00:29:23.776 A:middle
And, I can just grab a file I

00:29:23.776 --> 00:29:26.286 A:middle
have here on desktop, and drop

00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:27.576 A:middle
it onto its window.

00:29:27.746 --> 00:29:28.376 A:middle
Just like that.

00:29:29.596 --> 00:29:30.476 A:middle
On the upper right, I have a

00:29:30.476 --> 00:29:32.276 A:middle
little button, where I can add a

00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:35.566 A:middle
text box, and I can add some

00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:37.246 A:middle
text to my image.

00:29:38.496 --> 00:29:40.306 A:middle
I can select it, move it around,

00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:45.066 A:middle
and when I'm ready, I can send

00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:47.466 A:middle
it over iMessage, for example.

00:29:52.756 --> 00:29:55.066 A:middle
So, while this image is great, I

00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:56.506 A:middle
really want to use an image I

00:29:56.506 --> 00:29:57.296 A:middle
found on the web.

00:29:57.826 --> 00:29:59.686 A:middle
So, let's open up Safari, and
