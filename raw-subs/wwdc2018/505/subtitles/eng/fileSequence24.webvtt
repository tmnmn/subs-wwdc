00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:00.176 A:middle
with macOS Sierra.

00:24:00.176 --> 00:24:02.956 A:middle
So, let's start first with

00:24:02.956 --> 00:24:03.966 A:middle
receiving file promises.

00:24:09.046 --> 00:24:11.516 A:middle
As a general rule, apps

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:12.966 A:middle
supporting drag and drop should

00:24:12.966 --> 00:24:15.656 A:middle
always accept both file URL's

00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:16.646 A:middle
and file promises.

00:24:16.806 --> 00:24:17.916 A:middle
And, I'll explain why.

00:24:18.466 --> 00:24:21.156 A:middle
There are multiple apps

00:24:21.186 --> 00:24:22.416 A:middle
providing file promises.

00:24:23.736 --> 00:24:25.886 A:middle
Photos is using file promises

00:24:25.886 --> 00:24:27.846 A:middle
when dragging an image, a video,

00:24:28.076 --> 00:24:30.766 A:middle
or entire album, and since macOS

00:24:30.766 --> 00:24:32.956 A:middle
Mojave, you can-- we added the

00:24:32.956 --> 00:24:35.696 A:middle
ability to drag the people or

00:24:35.696 --> 00:24:36.296 A:middle
memories.

00:24:37.016 --> 00:24:38.416 A:middle
So, we are not the only app

00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:39.536 A:middle
using file promises.

00:24:40.706 --> 00:24:42.406 A:middle
Mail is using file promises when

00:24:42.406 --> 00:24:44.286 A:middle
dragging a message to Finder, to

00:24:44.286 --> 00:24:45.856 A:middle
save the entire email, including

00:24:45.856 --> 00:24:46.616 A:middle
attachments.

00:24:47.856 --> 00:24:49.626 A:middle
Safari is using file promises

00:24:49.626 --> 00:24:50.576 A:middle
when dragging an image.

00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:54.226 A:middle
And, Keynote is using file

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
promises when dragging a

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.116 A:middle
selection of slides to create a

00:24:57.116 --> 00:24:58.346 A:middle
new document containing those

00:24:58.346 --> 00:24:58.706 A:middle
slides.

00:24:59.466 --> 00:25:01.966 A:middle
So, if you want to receive files
