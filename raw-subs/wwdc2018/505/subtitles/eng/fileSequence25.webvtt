So, if you want to receive files

00:25:02.036 --> 00:25:04.176 A:middle
from those apps, or any app

00:25:04.226 --> 00:25:05.546 A:middle
providing file promises, then

00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:07.266 A:middle
your app needs to read file

00:25:07.266 --> 00:25:08.426 A:middle
promises, and need to accept

00:25:08.476 --> 00:25:08.986 A:middle
those files.

00:25:09.566 --> 00:25:11.206 A:middle
So, let's see how we can do that

00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:12.246 A:middle
by looking at some code.

00:25:12.676 --> 00:25:17.206 A:middle
First, during setup, a view must

00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:18.546 A:middle
register what types it'll accept

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:19.406 A:middle
by calling

00:25:19.406 --> 00:25:21.176 A:middle
registerForDraggedTypes.

00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:23.516 A:middle
And, in order to accept file

00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:25.956 A:middle
promises, you can use the class

00:25:25.956 --> 00:25:28.336 A:middle
property readableDraggedTypes on

00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:29.526 A:middle
NSFilePromiseReceiver.

00:25:31.756 --> 00:25:34.736 A:middle
Then, when performing the drag

00:25:34.736 --> 00:25:37.456 A:middle
operation, and when enumerating

00:25:37.456 --> 00:25:40.076 A:middle
or draggingItems, you should add

00:25:40.076 --> 00:25:40.766 A:middle
support to

00:25:40.766 --> 00:25:43.086 A:middle
NSFilePromiseReceiver, and make

00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:44.456 A:middle
sure to handle it first.

00:25:45.066 --> 00:25:46.886 A:middle
Because it's more likely to

00:25:46.886 --> 00:25:48.656 A:middle
contain the highest quality

00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:49.456 A:middle
representation.

00:25:49.646 --> 00:25:54.176 A:middle
For each filePromiseReceiver,

00:25:54.846 --> 00:25:57.506 A:middle
you call in the promise, and

00:25:57.506 --> 00:26:00.786 A:middle
when the file is ready, then the
