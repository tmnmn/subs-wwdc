00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
the introduction of the Photo

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.006 A:middle
Project Extension API last year,

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:05.536 A:middle
to build on that ecosystem.

00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:09.606 A:middle
We've seen some great extensions

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:10.056 A:middle
already.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.686 A:middle
For example, Mimeo Photos.

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:15.886 A:middle
It lets you create these books,

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.386 A:middle
and cards, and calendars of

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:18.796 A:middle
exceptional quality.

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:22.036 A:middle
There's Whitewall, that lets you

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:23.886 A:middle
create gallery-quality framed

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:25.246 A:middle
prints from your photos.

00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:28.096 A:middle
And, we have digital services

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:30.466 A:middle
like Wix.com, that make it very

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.216 A:middle
easy for you to create web photo

00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:33.266 A:middle
albums to share with your

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.236 A:middle
friends and family.

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.696 A:middle
And, we're now seeing some new

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:39.046 A:middle
extensions on the horizon.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:42.066 A:middle
Like this one, called Motif.

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:44.886 A:middle
It is a brand-new fully native

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:47.246 A:middle
experience, integrated directly

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:49.606 A:middle
into Photos, coming to you this

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:49.926 A:middle
summer.

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:56.386 A:middle
All of this choice, this whole

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:58.866 A:middle
ecosystem is a tremendous

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
opportunity to you, as a
