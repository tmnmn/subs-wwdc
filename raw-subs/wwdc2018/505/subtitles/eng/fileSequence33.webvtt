00:32:58.056 --> 00:33:00.616 A:middle
provider, and we're going to

00:33:00.616 --> 00:33:02.476 A:middle
provide a JPEG image.

00:33:03.346 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
And, we're going to use this

00:33:05.346 --> 00:33:07.236 A:middle
userInfo property to store the

00:33:07.236 --> 00:33:09.496 A:middle
snapshotItem, which we're going

00:33:09.496 --> 00:33:10.856 A:middle
to use later to write out the

00:33:10.856 --> 00:33:11.646 A:middle
file to disk.

00:33:14.016 --> 00:33:16.416 A:middle
As a next step, let's conform to

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:17.976 A:middle
NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate.

00:33:22.176 --> 00:33:22.966 A:middle
Just like this.

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:25.466 A:middle
Jump back down.

00:33:26.236 --> 00:33:27.246 A:middle
And, implement the three

00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:28.796 A:middle
delegate methods you heard about

00:33:28.796 --> 00:33:29.396 A:middle
just before.

00:33:30.756 --> 00:33:34.186 A:middle
The first one returns the file

00:33:34.186 --> 00:33:35.256 A:middle
name.

00:33:36.226 --> 00:33:37.896 A:middle
For simplicity, we're just

00:33:37.896 --> 00:33:39.176 A:middle
returning a static file name

00:33:39.176 --> 00:33:39.436 A:middle
here.

00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:42.976 A:middle
The second one returns an

00:33:42.976 --> 00:33:43.766 A:middle
operationQueue.

00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:46.306 A:middle
And, we happen to have one right

00:33:46.306 --> 00:33:46.566 A:middle
here.

00:33:47.956 --> 00:33:49.476 A:middle
And, the third method is

00:33:49.476 --> 00:33:51.676 A:middle
actually going to write the file

00:33:51.676 --> 00:33:51.976 A:middle
to disk.

00:33:58.746 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
So, what's happening here, is
