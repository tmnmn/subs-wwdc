PhotoKit objects to the

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.396 A:middle
extension by default, but your

00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:04.626 A:middle
extension can potentially

00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:05.806 A:middle
interfere with that if you

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:06.986 A:middle
register for the wrong types.

00:21:07.276 --> 00:21:08.876 A:middle
So, please be careful what types

00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:10.456 A:middle
your extension is registering

00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:12.796 A:middle
for, and only register for

00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:14.746 A:middle
extension internal drags, or

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:16.096 A:middle
other drags you really want to

00:21:16.096 --> 00:21:16.416 A:middle
handle.

00:21:16.806 --> 00:21:19.166 A:middle
Be especially careful if you use

00:21:19.166 --> 00:21:21.546 A:middle
WKWebView, because it registers

00:21:21.596 --> 00:21:24.926 A:middle
for a bunch of drag types by

00:21:26.046 --> 00:21:26.476 A:middle
default.

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:28.036 A:middle
That was everything about photo

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:28.866 A:middle
project extensions.

00:21:29.136 --> 00:21:30.346 A:middle
Let me now hand over to my

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:32.416 A:middle
colleague Sanaa to talk about

00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:33.856 A:middle
integrating with Photos--

00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:35.666 A:middle
interacting with Photos as a

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:36.526 A:middle
third-party application.

00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:36.716 A:middle
Thank you.

00:21:41.886 --> 00:21:43.176 A:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:21:43.846 --> 00:21:44.746 A:middle
My name is Sanaa.

00:21:44.746 --> 00:21:46.136 A:middle
I am a Photos engineer, and

00:21:46.136 --> 00:21:47.606 A:middle
today with my colleague Joachim,

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.896 A:middle
we are going to talk about some

00:21:48.896 --> 00:21:51.136 A:middle
best practices for receiving and

00:21:51.136 --> 00:21:52.696 A:middle
providing images or videos

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:54.886 A:middle
between apps on macOS, using

00:21:54.886 --> 00:21:55.406 A:middle
drag and drop.

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:59.086 A:middle
Drag and drop is one of the most

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:00.576 A:middle
intuitive and easiest way to
