00:34:59.956 --> 00:35:01.916 A:middle
promises to your app, and

00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:03.896 A:middle
improve the user experience.

00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:06.276 A:middle
And, with that, I'd like to hand

00:35:06.276 --> 00:35:06.946 A:middle
it back to Eric.

00:35:07.576 --> 00:35:07.856 A:middle
Thank you.

00:35:08.516 --> 00:35:12.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:13.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great stuff.

00:35:14.106 --> 00:35:14.606 A:middle
Great stuff.

00:35:14.606 --> 00:35:15.666 A:middle
I hope you really enjoyed that.

00:35:15.986 --> 00:35:17.976 A:middle
I just have a few words, just in

00:35:17.976 --> 00:35:18.496 A:middle
summary.

00:35:18.736 --> 00:35:20.796 A:middle
To, kind of, tie this all

00:35:20.796 --> 00:35:21.306 A:middle
together.

00:35:21.306 --> 00:35:23.976 A:middle
And, I'll start by saying, you

00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:26.956 A:middle
know, photos really, really

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:28.816 A:middle
matter to all of us.

00:35:29.176 --> 00:35:30.906 A:middle
Right? Millions and millions of

00:35:30.906 --> 00:35:32.386 A:middle
people around the world take

00:35:32.386 --> 00:35:34.626 A:middle
millions of photos every day.

00:35:35.686 --> 00:35:37.356 A:middle
And, all of those photos find a

00:35:37.356 --> 00:35:39.316 A:middle
home inside the Photos app.

00:35:39.826 --> 00:35:42.206 A:middle
But, they're nothing if they

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:43.026 A:middle
can't be shared.

00:35:44.026 --> 00:35:45.586 A:middle
If they can't be shown.

00:35:45.586 --> 00:35:47.616 A:middle
If they can't be preserved into

00:35:47.616 --> 00:35:48.756 A:middle
beautiful keepsakes.

00:35:49.206 --> 00:35:51.836 A:middle
And so, all of these people

00:35:51.836 --> 00:35:53.066 A:middle
capturing all of these images,

00:35:53.066 --> 00:35:55.626 A:middle
they rely on you, the developer,

00:35:55.856 --> 00:35:57.606 A:middle
to create amazing apps that let

00:35:57.606 --> 00:35:58.866 A:middle
them do creative things with

00:35:58.936 --> 00:35:59.756 A:middle
those images.
