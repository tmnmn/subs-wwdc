00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.076 A:middle
We pushed the edit session to

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:02.996 A:middle
the top of the view stack, with

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.056 A:middle
that photo loaded.

00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:05.436 A:middle
Let the user make any

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
adjustments they want to make.

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:08.876 A:middle
And, we also give them access to

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:10.456 A:middle
all of the other assets that are

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.616 A:middle
used in that project.

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:13.476 A:middle
When they're done with their

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:15.246 A:middle
editing session, they simply hit

00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:17.116 A:middle
the Done button, and they're

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.876 A:middle
returned to the project that

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:19.526 A:middle
they're working on.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.906 A:middle
You get a notification that the

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:23.856 A:middle
library changed.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.126 A:middle
You can respond to that, and

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:26.506 A:middle
update your UI accordingly.

00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:30.726 A:middle
But, none of this would matter

00:05:32.136 --> 00:05:34.196 A:middle
if it was hard to find the apps

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:35.136 A:middle
and the extensions that you

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:35.626 A:middle
create.

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:37.596 A:middle
And so, we're stepping up the

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:40.036 A:middle
game in the discoverability of

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.206 A:middle
your applications.

00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:44.056 A:middle
The Photos app links to the Mac

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.596 A:middle
App Store in the Create menu.

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:48.836 A:middle
And now, with the brand-new Mac

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:51.546 A:middle
App Store, on macOS Mojave, we

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:53.726 A:middle
actually can link directly to a

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:56.066 A:middle
fully curated story that's

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:57.876 A:middle
targeted specifically at the

00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:59.306 A:middle
extension experience.
