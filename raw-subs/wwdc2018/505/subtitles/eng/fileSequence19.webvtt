00:18:59.176 --> 00:19:00.626 A:middle
something more sophisticated in

00:19:00.626 --> 00:19:00.876 A:middle
here.

00:19:02.326 --> 00:19:03.976 A:middle
Let's rerun the project again.

00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:23.996 A:middle
OK. I can now drag the album

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:27.256 A:middle
from the sidebar, release it

00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:30.076 A:middle
over the extension, and the

00:19:30.076 --> 00:19:31.876 A:middle
assets are added to the project,

00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:34.536 A:middle
and the extension listens to the

00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:36.176 A:middle
photo library change

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.676 A:middle
observation, gets notified of

00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:39.316 A:middle
the change, and we update our

00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:39.976 A:middle
project info.

00:19:40.516 --> 00:19:47.656 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:51.146 A:middle
So, as you just saw, with only a

00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:52.886 A:middle
few steps, I was able to improve

00:19:52.886 --> 00:19:55.446 A:middle
my extension by using the

00:19:55.446 --> 00:19:57.466 A:middle
projectInfo, and the regions of

00:19:57.466 --> 00:19:59.116 A:middle
interest in the projectInfo, and

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:01.366 A:middle
also registering asset change
