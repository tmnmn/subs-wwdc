00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:01.556 A:middle
And, this is an evergreen story

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:02.366 A:middle
that will live on.

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:03.296 A:middle
It's something that we can

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.716 A:middle
update, and feature new

00:06:05.716 --> 00:06:07.396 A:middle
experiences, and educate users

00:06:07.396 --> 00:06:08.826 A:middle
on new ways to do things with

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:09.556 A:middle
their photos.

00:06:10.066 --> 00:06:12.766 A:middle
And, when a user downloads an

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.936 A:middle
app from this story, they're

00:06:16.936 --> 00:06:18.386 A:middle
downloading an app that contains

00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:19.116 A:middle
an extension.

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:22.086 A:middle
And, historically, that may have

00:06:22.086 --> 00:06:24.696 A:middle
led you, as a developer, to put

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:25.766 A:middle
some time into, kind of,

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:27.096 A:middle
educating users in your

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:28.606 A:middle
standalone app on how to use the

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:29.776 A:middle
extension in Photos.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:30.996 A:middle
But, we think we can do

00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:31.766 A:middle
something better.

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:34.106 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if the user

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:35.256 A:middle
could download an app and

00:06:35.256 --> 00:06:36.466 A:middle
immediately launch into the

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:37.766 A:middle
project creation experience in

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:38.306 A:middle
Photos?

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:40.546 A:middle
We're making that possible.

00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:43.696 A:middle
We've added a custom URL scheme

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:45.866 A:middle
to Photos, where you can simply

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:47.596 A:middle
pass in your extension

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:49.926 A:middle
identifier, and optionally pass

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:51.456 A:middle
in a category.

00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:53.986 A:middle
And, Photos will be brought to

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.556 A:middle
the back-- brought to the

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:58.956 A:middle
foreground, with the options of

00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:00.336 A:middle
your extension displayed for the
