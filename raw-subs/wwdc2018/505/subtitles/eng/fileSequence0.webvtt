00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:23.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:25.906 A:middle
Good morning.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:27.786 A:middle
My name's Eric Hanson.

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:29.476 A:middle
I'm the Technology Evangelist

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:30.736 A:middle
for the Photos platform.

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:32.415 A:middle
And, I'm joined by three of my

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:33.626 A:middle
colleagues from the Photos

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.476 A:middle
engineering team today to talk

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:37.506 A:middle
to you about integrating your

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:38.806 A:middle
application with Photos on

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:39.566 A:middle
macOS.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.586 A:middle
We have two key things that

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:44.486 A:middle
we're going to talk about.

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:48.146 A:middle
The first is a full update on

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:49.736 A:middle
the Photos Project Extension API

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.366 A:middle
that we introduced last year in

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.606 A:middle
macOS High Sierra.

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:54.906 A:middle
And then, we're going to get

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:57.636 A:middle
into interacting with your

00:00:57.636 --> 00:01:00.166 A:middle
application via drag and drop.
