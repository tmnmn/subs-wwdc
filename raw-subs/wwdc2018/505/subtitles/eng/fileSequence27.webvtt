00:27:01.066 --> 00:27:02.736 A:middle
So, that was receiving file

00:27:02.736 --> 00:27:03.216 A:middle
promises.

00:27:03.676 --> 00:27:05.236 A:middle
Now, let's see how we can

00:27:05.236 --> 00:27:06.336 A:middle
provide file promises.

00:27:07.186 --> 00:27:08.736 A:middle
And, you should consider

00:27:09.106 --> 00:27:10.636 A:middle
implementing this in your app,

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:12.636 A:middle
if the data you want to send

00:27:12.636 --> 00:27:14.296 A:middle
over drag and drop does not

00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:15.416 A:middle
exist yet on disk.

00:27:16.556 --> 00:27:18.196 A:middle
So, let's have a look on how we

00:27:18.196 --> 00:27:20.806 A:middle
can do that by looking at the

00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:20.976 A:middle
API.

00:27:25.336 --> 00:27:27.906 A:middle
First, you will need to create

00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:28.616 A:middle
an instance of

00:27:28.616 --> 00:27:29.896 A:middle
NSFilePromiseProvider.

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.796 A:middle
You should create one instance

00:27:33.796 --> 00:27:34.906 A:middle
for each promised file.

00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:37.236 A:middle
And, before writing the

00:27:37.236 --> 00:27:39.226 A:middle
filePromiseProvider object to

00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:41.186 A:middle
the pasteboard, it must contain

00:27:41.186 --> 00:27:43.416 A:middle
a file type, and a delegate.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:45.486 A:middle
These delegate is doing the

00:27:45.486 --> 00:27:46.976 A:middle
heavy lifting of writing files

00:27:46.976 --> 00:27:47.516 A:middle
to disk.

00:27:48.456 --> 00:27:50.696 A:middle
There are only three methods for

00:27:50.696 --> 00:27:52.526 A:middle
NSFilePromiseProvider delegates.

00:27:53.136 --> 00:27:54.746 A:middle
The first one is called by the

00:27:54.746 --> 00:27:57.586 A:middle
drag destination, and returns

00:27:57.586 --> 00:27:58.966 A:middle
the file name, not the full

00:27:58.966 --> 00:27:59.416 A:middle
path.

00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:03.136 A:middle
The second one return an
