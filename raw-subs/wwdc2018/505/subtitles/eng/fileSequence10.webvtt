00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.216 A:middle
And, the value for the key, is a

00:10:02.216 --> 00:10:04.436 A:middle
list of the supported project

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:05.006 A:middle
categories.

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:06.636 A:middle
In this case, it's Wall Decor

00:10:06.896 --> 00:10:07.426 A:middle
and Other.

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:11.756 A:middle
The next thing the user sees

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.866 A:middle
from the extension, is the

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:14.176 A:middle
[inaudible] sheet.

00:10:14.766 --> 00:10:16.186 A:middle
You provide us with the data,

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:21.446 A:middle
and we display the project type

00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:22.606 A:middle
descriptions you provide.

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:25.446 A:middle
The problem with the API we

00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:27.096 A:middle
introduced last year is that

00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:30.056 A:middle
it's kind of hard to provide

00:10:30.056 --> 00:10:31.356 A:middle
up-to-date price information or

00:10:31.356 --> 00:10:32.106 A:middle
current offers.

00:10:32.606 --> 00:10:34.756 A:middle
That's why we're introducing a

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:37.156 A:middle
new, improved API to allow for

00:10:37.156 --> 00:10:38.446 A:middle
dynamic updates, which would

00:10:38.446 --> 00:10:39.196 A:middle
look like this.

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:41.946 A:middle
In addition to dynamic updates,

00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:44.766 A:middle
we now also support display of a

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:46.966 A:middle
custom footer text at the bottom

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:48.496 A:middle
of the sheet, which you can use

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:49.966 A:middle
to display legal text if you

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:52.716 A:middle
have the requirement to do so.

00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:57.476 A:middle
On an API level, the new dynamic

00:10:57.476 --> 00:10:58.676 A:middle
API looks like this.

00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.786 A:middle
We have the new method on the
