00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
opportunity to you, as a

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:01.376 A:middle
developer.

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:04.476 A:middle
You can take the very rich

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.846 A:middle
metadata and the context and the

00:03:06.846 --> 00:03:08.526 A:middle
image curation that we pass to

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:10.586 A:middle
your extension, and you can

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.316 A:middle
build on that, using the full

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:14.106 A:middle
stack of native frameworks on

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:16.316 A:middle
macOS, to create something

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.626 A:middle
really extraordinary, and new,

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
that delights users around the

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:20.976 A:middle
world.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:26.806 A:middle
And, it's for this reason that

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.026 A:middle
Apple is announcing we will be

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:31.716 A:middle
transitioning our entire print

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:32.976 A:middle
product business to this

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.626 A:middle
ecosystem in macOS Mojave.

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:39.586 A:middle
Project Extensions will be the

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.696 A:middle
way users will create books,

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:43.686 A:middle
cards, calendars, all sorts of

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:44.246 A:middle
things.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.406 A:middle
Whatever you surprise us with

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.686 A:middle
with your extensions.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:51.666 A:middle
And, by doing this, we're

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.306 A:middle
building a better Photos

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:54.616 A:middle
experience for everyone.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:57.686 A:middle
So, let's talk about what's new

00:03:57.686 --> 00:03:59.646 A:middle
in the Extensions API.
