00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
this projectInfo, and we will

00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:02.706 A:middle
update any existing sections,

00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:04.786 A:middle
and append a new section for any

00:13:04.866 --> 00:13:05.666 A:middle
added assets.

00:13:06.106 --> 00:13:07.386 A:middle
If the user adds some more

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.526 A:middle
assets, you can do the same

00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:08.956 A:middle
again.

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:10.596 A:middle
Pass in this project info, we

00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:11.686 A:middle
will update the existing

00:13:11.686 --> 00:13:13.396 A:middle
sections, and append a new

00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:14.896 A:middle
section for any added assets.

00:13:15.406 --> 00:13:18.546 A:middle
Let's now go into a more

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:19.516 A:middle
detailed element of the

00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:21.006 A:middle
projectInfo, the regions of

00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:21.466 A:middle
interest.

00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:23.346 A:middle
The regions of interest

00:13:23.346 --> 00:13:25.576 A:middle
highlight important regions in

00:13:25.576 --> 00:13:26.216 A:middle
the asset.

00:13:26.366 --> 00:13:27.576 A:middle
For example, the faces of

00:13:27.636 --> 00:13:27.946 A:middle
people.

00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:31.446 A:middle
And, if the same person appears

00:13:31.446 --> 00:13:33.376 A:middle
in multiple images, the region

00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:35.106 A:middle
of interest identifier will be

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.166 A:middle
the same for the same person.

00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:39.576 A:middle
Let's focus on Person B for a

00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:39.936 A:middle
moment.

00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:43.606 A:middle
In addition to the region of

00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:45.376 A:middle
interest identifier, we have

00:13:45.766 --> 00:13:47.576 A:middle
weight on the regions of

00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:50.316 A:middle
interest, which represents the

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:52.136 A:middle
importance of the region of

00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:53.986 A:middle
interest in the project.

00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.246 A:middle
But, if you want to decide which

00:13:57.476 --> 00:13:58.516 A:middle
image to pick as a

00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:00.376 A:middle
representative image for a
