00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:01.866 A:middle
So, if you only remember two

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:03.266 A:middle
things from this session today,

00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:04.516 A:middle
please remember this.

00:36:05.446 --> 00:36:07.006 A:middle
Support file promises.

00:36:07.676 --> 00:36:09.846 A:middle
You saw it's really easy to have

00:36:09.846 --> 00:36:11.476 A:middle
some very immediate interaction

00:36:11.476 --> 00:36:12.316 A:middle
with the Photos app.

00:36:13.636 --> 00:36:14.606 A:middle
Please, please do that.

00:36:15.096 --> 00:36:17.096 A:middle
And, secondly, we strongly

00:36:17.096 --> 00:36:19.186 A:middle
encourage you to explore all of

00:36:19.186 --> 00:36:20.956 A:middle
the API that's available to you

00:36:20.956 --> 00:36:22.446 A:middle
in the project extension

00:36:22.976 --> 00:36:24.426 A:middle
experience within Photos.

00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:27.466 A:middle
Going back to what I said at the

00:36:27.466 --> 00:36:29.726 A:middle
beginning, this is a blossoming

00:36:29.726 --> 00:36:30.536 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:36:30.536 --> 00:36:31.476 A:middle
And, there's a tremendous

00:36:31.476 --> 00:36:33.006 A:middle
opportunity to embrace it.

00:36:33.516 --> 00:36:35.046 A:middle
And, collectively for us to

00:36:35.046 --> 00:36:36.276 A:middle
create a better Photos

00:36:36.276 --> 00:36:37.456 A:middle
experience for everybody.

00:36:40.096 --> 00:36:42.526 A:middle
So, with that, please join us in

00:36:42.526 --> 00:36:43.696 A:middle
the lab this afternoon.

00:36:44.326 --> 00:36:46.526 A:middle
We have tons of engineers on

00:36:46.526 --> 00:36:48.806 A:middle
staff to help you with any of

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:50.946 A:middle
your PhotoKit questions, Photos

00:36:50.946 --> 00:36:53.446 A:middle
extensions, be it iOS, macOS, we

00:36:53.846 --> 00:36:54.936 A:middle
really look forward to talking

00:36:54.936 --> 00:36:55.486 A:middle
to you there.

00:36:56.306 --> 00:36:58.036 A:middle
And, enjoy the rest of your

00:36:58.036 --> 00:36:58.176 A:middle
WWDC.

00:36:58.176 --> 00:36:58.596 A:middle
Thank you.
