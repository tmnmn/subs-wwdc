00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.786 A:middle
We have the new method on the

00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:02.456 A:middle
projectExtensionsController

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:05.646 A:middle
protocol, and we ask for a data

00:11:05.646 --> 00:11:06.726 A:middle
source, instead of a list of

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:07.676 A:middle
product type descriptions.

00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:10.266 A:middle
And, pass in the category from

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.246 A:middle
the menu in which the

00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:12.816 A:middle
selection-- the extension was

00:11:12.816 --> 00:11:13.216 A:middle
selected.

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:14.936 A:middle
And also, an invalidator object.

00:11:15.816 --> 00:11:17.416 A:middle
Once you return the data source,

00:11:17.986 --> 00:11:19.776 A:middle
we ask the data source for the

00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:21.366 A:middle
project type descriptions, and

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:22.586 A:middle
for the optional footer text.

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:24.726 A:middle
Whenever your extension has the

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.236 A:middle
need to invalidate the

00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:27.946 A:middle
information returned, you can

00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:29.506 A:middle
use invalidator to invalidate

00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:30.566 A:middle
the project type descriptions,

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:32.586 A:middle
or the footer text, and when

00:11:32.586 --> 00:11:34.536 A:middle
necessary, photos will refetch

00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:36.036 A:middle
the data from the data source,

00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:37.706 A:middle
and display the up-to-date data

00:11:37.706 --> 00:11:37.976 A:middle
in the UI.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.616 A:middle
The next topic is the

00:11:43.616 --> 00:11:44.376 A:middle
projectInfo.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.516 A:middle
The projectInfo is structured,

00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:48.906 A:middle
additional information about the

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:50.146 A:middle
contents of the project.

00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:52.546 A:middle
And, it's structured into

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:54.646 A:middle
sections, and sectionContents

00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:56.646 A:middle
which reflect creation level.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.686 A:middle
And, the elements have basic

00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:03.416 A:middle
layout hints, and also weights
