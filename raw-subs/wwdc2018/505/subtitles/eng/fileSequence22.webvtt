00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:00.576 A:middle
intuitive and easiest way to

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:01.916 A:middle
move items from one place to

00:22:01.916 --> 00:22:02.326 A:middle
another.

00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:04.476 A:middle
But, sometimes, you might have

00:22:04.476 --> 00:22:05.726 A:middle
encountered this situation

00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:05.976 A:middle
instead.

00:22:10.206 --> 00:22:11.336 A:middle
If this is something happening

00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:12.656 A:middle
with your app, then you are

00:22:12.656 --> 00:22:13.796 A:middle
sitting in the right session.

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:13.933 A:middle
So--

00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:18.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:19.616 A:middle
Let's take a step back to

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:20.646 A:middle
understand what's happening

00:22:20.646 --> 00:22:20.916 A:middle
here.

00:22:22.656 --> 00:22:24.786 A:middle
Drag and drop on macOS is using

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:27.186 A:middle
NSPasteboard, and when it's

00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:28.526 A:middle
wrapped in with the pasteboard,

00:22:28.686 --> 00:22:30.276 A:middle
reading and writing data happens

00:22:30.276 --> 00:22:31.866 A:middle
on the main trade, for both the

00:22:31.866 --> 00:22:33.806 A:middle
receiving and providing apps.

00:22:34.326 --> 00:22:36.976 A:middle
In the past, since all local was

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:38.716 A:middle
stored on local disk, you could

00:22:39.206 --> 00:22:40.526 A:middle
put the file URL's into the

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:41.066 A:middle
pasteboard.

00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:44.276 A:middle
But, things have changed today.

00:22:44.536 --> 00:22:46.816 A:middle
Images or videos might not be on

00:22:46.816 --> 00:22:48.176 A:middle
disk if the user is using

00:22:48.176 --> 00:22:50.636 A:middle
iCloud, so Photos, we need to

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:51.906 A:middle
download the full resolution

00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:53.696 A:middle
item first, before putting the

00:22:53.696 --> 00:22:55.246 A:middle
file URL into the pasteboard.

00:22:55.716 --> 00:22:58.966 A:middle
Also, Photos respect the privacy

00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
settings of drag and drop, so if
