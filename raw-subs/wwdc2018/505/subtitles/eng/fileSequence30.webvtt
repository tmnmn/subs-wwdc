00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:03.146 A:middle
try to drag this image onto our

00:30:03.146 --> 00:30:03.266 A:middle
app.

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:08.516 A:middle
Unfortunately, this doesn't

00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:08.716 A:middle
work.

00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:12.116 A:middle
So, let's jump to Xcode, and see

00:30:12.116 --> 00:30:12.896 A:middle
if we can fix that.

00:30:17.156 --> 00:30:18.226 A:middle
Here I am in the main

00:30:18.226 --> 00:30:19.716 A:middle
viewController of our app.

00:30:20.466 --> 00:30:22.696 A:middle
And, we going to jump straight

00:30:22.816 --> 00:30:23.676 A:middle
to view [inaudible].

00:30:24.456 --> 00:30:26.076 A:middle
And, have a look at what's going

00:30:26.076 --> 00:30:26.326 A:middle
on.

00:30:26.906 --> 00:30:30.606 A:middle
Right here, we're only

00:30:30.606 --> 00:30:32.286 A:middle
registering for file URL's.

00:30:33.136 --> 00:30:35.026 A:middle
So, let's fix that, and register

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.976 A:middle
for FilePromiseReceiver as well.

00:30:41.686 --> 00:30:45.346 A:middle
Next, when handling the drag

00:30:45.346 --> 00:30:47.706 A:middle
operation, we need to take care

00:30:47.706 --> 00:30:50.106 A:middle
of FilePromiseReceiver as well.

00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:54.476 A:middle
So. Let's jump to the next

00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:56.596 A:middle
method right here.

00:30:56.866 --> 00:30:57.746 A:middle
So, here is the list of

00:30:57.746 --> 00:31:00.056 A:middle
supported classes, and we only
