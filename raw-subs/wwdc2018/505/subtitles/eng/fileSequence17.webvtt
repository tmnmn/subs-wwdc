00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:01.876 A:middle
I release the mouse and nothing

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:02.296 A:middle
happens.

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:04.126 A:middle
The assets were added to the

00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:05.986 A:middle
project, but my extension

00:17:06.215 --> 00:17:07.165 A:middle
doesn't list the change

00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:07.776 A:middle
notification.

00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:10.316 A:middle
And, doesn't know that assets

00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:11.146 A:middle
were added to the project.

00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:14.286 A:middle
So, let's switch back to Xcode

00:17:14.286 --> 00:17:15.965 A:middle
and fix that.

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:18.396 A:middle
In my projectViewController, I

00:17:18.396 --> 00:17:20.205 A:middle
have the begin and resumeProject

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.896 A:middle
method, which are a part of the

00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:24.106 A:middle
projectExtensionController

00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:24.626 A:middle
protocol.

00:17:25.116 --> 00:17:27.006 A:middle
And, here I want to register for

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:27.965 A:middle
change observation.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:32.686 A:middle
And, we add the same code in

00:17:32.746 --> 00:17:33.676 A:middle
both methods.

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:36.796 A:middle
First, we get the PhotoKit

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.426 A:middle
object we're interested in.

00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:42.286 A:middle
We're interested in additions of

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:44.326 A:middle
assets to the project, so we are

00:17:44.326 --> 00:17:45.916 A:middle
getting a fetch result for all

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:47.956 A:middle
assets on the project, and then

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.916 A:middle
we are registering asset change

00:17:49.916 --> 00:17:51.116 A:middle
observer for the library.

00:17:51.816 --> 00:17:53.596 A:middle
In finished project, we

00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:54.626 A:middle
[inaudible] registering.

00:17:55.456 --> 00:17:57.996 A:middle
And, since Xcode complains that

00:17:57.996 --> 00:17:59.546 A:middle
we don't implement the protocol,

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.096 A:middle
we add that.
