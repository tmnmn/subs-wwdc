00:15:03.726 --> 00:15:07.916 A:middle
OK. I created a slideshow

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:11.126 A:middle
extension, and to show you how

00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:12.786 A:middle
it looks like, I selected some

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:15.946 A:middle
assets in an album, and will

00:15:15.946 --> 00:15:17.706 A:middle
create a new project with the

00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:18.246 A:middle
extension.

00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:22.096 A:middle
The extension has two views, one

00:15:22.096 --> 00:15:23.586 A:middle
is the overview, which contains

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:25.086 A:middle
all assets of the project.

00:15:25.546 --> 00:15:27.546 A:middle
And, the other is the playback

00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:28.806 A:middle
modus, which plays the

00:15:28.806 --> 00:15:29.286 A:middle
slideshow.

00:15:31.416 --> 00:15:32.706 A:middle
As you might notice, the

00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:34.296 A:middle
slideshow always zooms into the

00:15:34.296 --> 00:15:36.966 A:middle
center of the image, which is

00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:37.686 A:middle
kind of boring.

00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:39.966 A:middle
And, I want to use regions of

00:15:39.966 --> 00:15:41.406 A:middle
interest to always zoom into

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:43.066 A:middle
interesting regions in the

00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:43.376 A:middle
photo.

00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:47.566 A:middle
So, let's switch to Xcode to fix

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:49.276 A:middle
that.

00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:51.986 A:middle
Here in my asset model, I have

00:15:51.986 --> 00:15:53.216 A:middle
this property,

00:15:53.216 --> 00:15:54.976 A:middle
preferredZoomRect, and it always

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.126 A:middle
returns the same rect, which is

00:15:57.376 --> 00:15:58.026 A:middle
kind of boring.

00:15:58.446 --> 00:15:59.926 A:middle
So, let's replace it with the

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:00.356 A:middle
code.
