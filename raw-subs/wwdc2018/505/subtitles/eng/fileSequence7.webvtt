00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:00.336 A:middle
your extension displayed for the

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
user.

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.576 A:middle
So, they're immediately taken

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:05.376 A:middle
into the creation experience as

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:06.646 A:middle
a first-launch experience.

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:07.716 A:middle
And, we think this is great.

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.516 A:middle
And, finally, when they create a

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.216 A:middle
project, we want those projects

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:19.126 A:middle
to live where they belong, right

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.846 A:middle
inside the user's Photo library.

00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:23.426 A:middle
And so, that's exactly what we

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:23.676 A:middle
do.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.296 A:middle
We have this Project Gallery in

00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:27.406 A:middle
Photos that lets a user see all

00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:28.606 A:middle
the things that they've created.

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:30.676 A:middle
And we now let the extension

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:32.876 A:middle
create a custom preview for each

00:07:32.876 --> 00:07:33.496 A:middle
project.

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.636 A:middle
So, that preview can represent

00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:37.436 A:middle
what the project really is.

00:07:37.876 --> 00:07:39.716 A:middle
Take this photo mug for example.

00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
Not only can a user double-click

00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:44.866 A:middle
on one of those projects to get

00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:46.136 A:middle
back into your extension, to

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:48.206 A:middle
continue to work on it, they can

00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:49.466 A:middle
create projects from other

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:50.206 A:middle
projects.

00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:51.976 A:middle
They can simply select a

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:53.546 A:middle
project, go to the Create menu,

00:07:53.636 --> 00:07:54.896 A:middle
create something new from it.

00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:56.756 A:middle
And, we pass over everything we

00:07:56.756 --> 00:08:00.216 A:middle
can to help your extension, kind
