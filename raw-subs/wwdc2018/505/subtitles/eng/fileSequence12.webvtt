00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:03.416 A:middle
layout hints, and also weights

00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:05.046 A:middle
and scores for the assets.

00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:06.706 A:middle
And, assets can contain

00:12:07.176 --> 00:12:09.776 A:middle
important regions in the asset's

00:12:09.776 --> 00:12:10.786 A:middle
regions of interest.

00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:13.096 A:middle
This is just a quick reminder

00:12:13.096 --> 00:12:14.306 A:middle
what the projectInfo looks like.

00:12:14.596 --> 00:12:15.676 A:middle
If you want to know more about

00:12:15.676 --> 00:12:16.976 A:middle
the projectInfo, I highly

00:12:16.976 --> 00:12:18.376 A:middle
recommend last year's session,

00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:19.976 A:middle
What's New in Photos API.

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:26.556 A:middle
The projectInfo is handed to

00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:29.056 A:middle
your extension during begin

00:12:29.056 --> 00:12:29.506 A:middle
project.

00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:33.976 A:middle
And, whenever the user adds new

00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:35.176 A:middle
assets to the project, the

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:36.456 A:middle
projectInfo will be outdated,

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:37.946 A:middle
because it's a static object.

00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:40.056 A:middle
And, we want to solve the

00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:41.446 A:middle
problem by introducing new API

00:12:41.446 --> 00:12:43.406 A:middle
on the projectExtensionsContext

00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:45.906 A:middle
to get updated project info,

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.196 A:middle
with the current state of the

00:12:47.196 --> 00:12:47.726 A:middle
project.

00:12:48.216 --> 00:12:49.886 A:middle
Let's take this as an example.

00:12:49.886 --> 00:12:51.586 A:middle
We handed you this projectInfo

00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:53.296 A:middle
during project creation, and

00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:54.646 A:middle
then the user added some more

00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:55.656 A:middle
assets to the project.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.286 A:middle
You can then call the

00:12:57.286 --> 00:12:59.156 A:middle
updatedProjectInfo method, with

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:01.226 A:middle
this projectInfo, and we will
