00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
settings of drag and drop, so if

00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:02.956 A:middle
the user choose to save the

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:04.566 A:middle
location information, then

00:23:04.566 --> 00:23:06.646 A:middle
Photos will export a new file

00:23:06.646 --> 00:23:07.736 A:middle
which does not contain this

00:23:07.736 --> 00:23:08.296 A:middle
metadata.

00:23:09.246 --> 00:23:10.826 A:middle
Both downloading and exporting

00:23:10.826 --> 00:23:12.746 A:middle
file takes time, and you don't

00:23:12.746 --> 00:23:13.696 A:middle
want to do that on the main

00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:16.776 A:middle
trade, since it's going to block

00:23:16.776 --> 00:23:19.106 A:middle
your app UI.

00:23:19.486 --> 00:23:21.206 A:middle
So, in order to fix this, we

00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:22.926 A:middle
need an asynchronous API.

00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:27.136 A:middle
In fact, we do have one, it's

00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:28.706 A:middle
called file promises.

00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:32.886 A:middle
File promise is a promise of--

00:23:32.986 --> 00:23:34.746 A:middle
that's a file of a certain type

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:36.776 A:middle
that does not exist yet on disk,

00:23:36.776 --> 00:23:38.446 A:middle
will be written in a provided

00:23:38.446 --> 00:23:39.006 A:middle
location.

00:23:39.726 --> 00:23:41.636 A:middle
It also allows the sender to

00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:42.966 A:middle
write files in the background.

00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:47.446 A:middle
There are two ways to interact

00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:49.426 A:middle
with file promises: receiving

00:23:49.426 --> 00:23:50.556 A:middle
files by using

00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:52.576 A:middle
NSFilePromiseReceiver and

00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:53.846 A:middle
providing files by using

00:23:53.846 --> 00:23:55.006 A:middle
NSFilePromiseProvider.

00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:57.556 A:middle
Both of these modern API's have

00:23:57.556 --> 00:23:59.196 A:middle
been introduced two years ago

00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:00.176 A:middle
with macOS Sierra.
